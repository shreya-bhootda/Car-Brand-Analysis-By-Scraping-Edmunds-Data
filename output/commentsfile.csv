0,"i personally think that with a few tweaks the c320 could also sit at the top of this group. it's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than mercedes benz benz would lead you to believe. the c320 ""sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. mb also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. the c240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the c320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first.

that toyotad, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new audi 3.0. the audi easily has the best interior of any sub-40k car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. the single thing i don't like about the audi is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. this trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. this is an hyundaient car and in my opinion the best there is under 40k. the upcoming audi convertible, coupe and s4 will all be winners.

the bmw 330i is now an old favorite, but i'm (of all people) starting to tire of the bmw just a bit, save the bmw vhondants. i was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. i hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models.

the acura tl-s is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. nice price, seat and what not, not hard to see why the tl is so popular. this car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. otherwise a standout.

lexus es300. nice, but not my type of car at all. this is one for the buick set. the is300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. styling is also in nissanon here, it simply doesn't look like a 35k car (grown). the interior is gawd-awful. bet on the next is300 being done right from the start. in their defense toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the u.s. so it was a rush job.

the cts holds the greatest unrealized potential here. i've seen several now, and each time i see one they look better and better. again like the c320, is300 the car has interior issues. the dash feels like it was made by rutoyotaermaid. if you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? the seat are very good though, as is the handling. a work in progress.

the pontiac5 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. another great engine, waiting to drive this one.

don't really care much for the x-type. if i were a jaguar man i'd be truly pissed at ford and jaguar for this one. they are actually selling a fwd x-type in england and i've read where they're thinking about selling it here! hell no. the car should have been rwd not awd. some will tell you that this was done to compete with audi. thats bs, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, without spending the money to convert the car to rwd. it is a good looking car though and that jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me.

the chryslerm is about as close to an audi that american car come. this new chrysler ""special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out. one problem: where is the performance???? a 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. something is not right here. some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, chrysler needs to let some mb engineers have a look at this car. the heavier e320 with less power is faster. i still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.

m"
1,i am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my ltoyota. the price difference between these two is approx. 6k (non-type s acura). is the es300 worth 6k over the tl? i don't know because i have never owned a tl but i am mazdar with the es300(previous generation). supposedly the 2002 es300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the tl? of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. does the tl compare with the es300 in both of these categorys? i am not mazdar with the honda co. are prices lower than lexus for service work? i would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some tl owners.
2,"great handling, rwd, hyundaient engine and the best warranty around. easy winner."
3,"and no manual tranny. that may not matter to you, but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers.

so imo, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'."
4,"one beauty of bmw 3 series is that there are so many models to choose from. almost half of all buyers in america don't get the basic rwd 4 door sedan. besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, awd, station wagon, and super-high performance m-series!!!

hungrywhale... i concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!"
5,"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual. even with an auto, i prefer to every car ltoyotaed and i never have owned an auto and never thought i'd enjoy driving a car with an auto. that's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car. once the g has a stick there is not another sedan under the bmw that i'd consider."
6,"i'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but i'm just flat-out not interested in an auto. i don't care how fast it is. it's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car."
7,"i understand it's not about the speed. i really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as i rarely break the buick mark. what i do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, i can get it when i want it. will i buy an auto-equipped g? in all likelihood, no. i desperately want to drive the 6 speed."
8,it sounds like you know why i won't even put it on my ltoyota (let alone at the top) until the manual comes out.
9,"is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan? not in my book. certainly not in europe or asia. only in america is such an oxymoron possible. sad.

if or when the manual pontiac5 comes out and the coupe version, then the pontiac5 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment."
10,"if i had to rank the entry lux performance sedan, here is what i would choose:

audi audi 3.0(lots of bang for the buck, loads of style and loads of luxury)

cadillac cts( decent btfb, good handling, non-lemming style)

infinity pontiac5(tons of bftb, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)

bmw 325(very little bftb, hyundaient handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)

saab viggen(almost zero bftb, spotty build quality, but the damn coolest style in the world).

everything else is not worth my time"
11,"hey my friend, dig this, in australia, the only bmw that can be had with a manual gearbox is the bmw! yeah, right, not the 525i, 530i, bmw or the 540i, they are all automatic only. :-(

best regards,
shipo"

riez, i read from your profile that you have a manual bmw bmw. but i think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a infiniti pontiac5 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan. from your logic, then the bmw bmw (your wife's) or the bmw with the steptronic should not be contenders either. that's belittling the infiniti, audi, lexus, acuras, bmw's etc. with automatics.

when i return in december from qatar, i plan on purchasing a sports sedan. i'm leaning on the pontiac5, but the bmw 330i along with the audi s4 are also contenders. imo, if the handling of the infiniti is as good as the bmw as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. also my first choice will be a manual, and infiniti should have the manual out by december. i will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there.

i do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. but, automatics in this category, especially those made by bmw, infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedan. different flavors for different people.

i have been following discussions on many boards and what i have been noticing is that there is so many ""experts"" on what is the best sports sedan. and most haven't even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. this is not aimed at you riez or shipko, because your profiles states that you own a bmw already. but from what i noticed is that some bmw ""supportors"" don't even own a bmw, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an infiniti pontiac5, but they still make ""unsuptoyotad"" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (see the edmund's bmw bmw discussion). i hope in your defense, toyota, that you drove the automatic infiniti pontiac5, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. i value your opinion and others as well.

again, i'm not flaming you, but i try to be an informed consumer before i buy anything. that is the reason that i will drive every car that i'm interested in and make my choice from there. i'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car i'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.

cheers!"
13,"i think what riez and i are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them

but any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan needs at least the option of a manual tranny. manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.

there's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but i sure don't want one."
14,amen
15,"in this class, the best bang for the buck has to be is300, assuming one can live with the styling.

i guess i'm one of the few that likes the old audi styling to the new. isn't the new audi pushing 3600 lbs. now? that's pretty heavy for this class."
16,"even at 29k for a 35k msrp is300, i passed on it. now i never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, i don't think i'd go near one. they're not up to audi/bmw/mb/infiniti."
17,"never liked a lexus, and probably never will. i would rather drive the cts. there is always something that irritates me about them. i would buy the is as a toyota but not a lexus...i personally think lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. toyota deserves something like it though.

also, i don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the pontiac5 is the same price with 260 horsies."
18,"""i would buy the is as a toyota but not a lexus""

how else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then?

reasonably equipped pontiac5 goes for $33k or so."
19,"i couldn't have toyotad it better myself. i'll let you lead services!

mbarto... i most certainly will test a pontiac5 manual if and when it finally comes out. i promise!!! automatics make nice luxury sedan and maybe even sporty luxury sedan. but not performance sedan or luxury performance sedan. (i don't even consider the 540ia sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic. if i could just get my wife to drive a manual....)"
20,"thanks riez! let me know when you do. i'm sure you'll get a chance before i will since i won't return until december. i am curious of how it compares to the bmw's. you can speak from experience, so i'll value your opinion.

it does make a difference being married. (lol! see the latest discussions on the infiniti pontiac5 vs bmw 330i board). first, i'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic. but she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice i'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. of course, it helps my cause when i let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. bribes do help! whatever i finally decide, i'm sure she'll be happy."
21,"mbarto... as regards the ""bribes"" issue, you've figured out one of life's great truism: you get what you want so i can get what i want."""
22,"so if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today, what car would they have to take a look at and test drive? lets say they only had time to look at five?

what five would they have to look into?"
23,"since it has to have a manual transmission and should be rwd (awd/4wd adds too much weight and complexity) and has to be fun to drive hard...

1. bmw 3 series manual
2. lexus is300 manual
3. cadillac cts manual
4. lincoln ls6 manual

if you want affordable and can go fwd, then add nissan nissan 6-speed with lsd and maybe nissan 3.5se 5-speed.

try to get car with lsd. inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines.

possible future car: infiniti pontiac5 sedan when it finally gets the 6-speed manual."
24,"the tl should be up for redesign in a few years so a tl would be outdated in the not so far future. and besides, it seems like everyone who drives an acura drives the tl. i love the es300. some say it looks bloated; i don't think it does. at the 3/4 angle, it looks impressive. the interior is as nice as a car can get. if i had the money, i would buy an es300 in a heartbeat. i never did like the past ones' boring styling...especially since the last two generations were nearly twins. go with the es. besides, lexus' quality is ahead of acura's."
25,"the new es is a very smart looking car. notwithstanding any engine issues though, i think there are direct price competitors like the i35 that offer better overall value on paper. now i haven't driven either new model, i did drive the older es300 and it did it's job very well. they are both great car. lexus for acuraary reliability and resale value, infiniti for up-to-date features."
26,"um...you left off the infiniti pontiac5 and it's bland, boring brother the i35 (the es300's competition).

29k gets someone a 4 door 260 hp performance entry level luxury sedan with all sorts of goodies."
27,"sorry, i thought that i had already taken up too much space, and i also was getting tired of typing. when i check out an infiniti pontiac5, maybe i'll post something on it.

i always thought the i35's looked all right, even if they aren't the most exciting car ever built."
28,"go drive one. they're a blast and for the money they're a steal. if someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price, the g's really tough to beat.

save for bmw, it sort of stands head and shoulders over most of its competition."
29,"i can't make a decision. i was set on the mb c240 but then i read some postings from people who got lemons. now i am starting to think that the audi 3.0 cvt front wheel drive is what i shoud get. any advice? low manintenance is what i am looking for.
thanks!"
30,"well i'm a mercedes benz benz fan first and foremost, but the audi 3.0 cvt just offers more for the money. the audi has a better interior, the top audi engine (compared to the c240, which is the base c) and it's styling is at least as good as the mercedes benz benz if not better. both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period. neither car will be ""low maintanence"" after the warranty runs out, especially the audi with it's fairly different transmission. if you're priced these car and they've come out equal go for the audi it's the better value here.

m"
31,"i think both are hyundaient(sp?) car, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. that is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance. what they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.

as someone has toyotad before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that. most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.

although i can not speak as to the driving merits of the car, i suspect that they are similar since i've heard (read) good things about both the audi cvt and the c240. something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.

both car are relative newcommers to the market. the facts that they are made by dtoyotainguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the car will be as a whole.

since you are already looking for alternatives to the mb because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the audi. as someone has suggested in the help me choose! forum, try looking to lexus for the answer. they seem to make reliable car that are also cheap to keep running. of course now we get into the issue of european vs asian luxury ..."
32,"it has come to my attention that as of late mb has taken a hit in its reputation. people have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both european and domestic - that say mercedes benz benz is no longer reliable. these surveys show that stattoyotaically speaking mb has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty. i won't deny these findings, but i will try and justify them.

1st and foremost, mb has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the car both inside and out. anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.

secondly, hondaing to mbspy.com, mercedes benz benz accounted for ~half of the profits by dcx last year. i think mb is being used as a cash cow to keep jeep and co affloat, thereby driving mercedes benz benz to cost-cutting through corparate pressure. lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.

these two should get things going ... feel free to agree or disagree."
33,"there is not much to debate on this subject. if you want a reliable car you buy japanese. if you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european. the japanese just do quality better and more constoyotaantly than anyone else. you also get a lot more car for your money with a japanese vehicle. there was a time when the europeans built the best driving car in the world. sadly for them those days are passing. the japanese keep building car that are closer and closer to european driving toyotamics (is and gs series lexus(lexi?), and q45 and pontiac5 infiniti's) while the europeans quality especially daimler/chrysler just is not keeping up."
34,gave up nationality based generalizations a couple of years ago.
35,"i'm interested more towards performance than luxury. also value is an important component for me. although i have the money to buy these car, i also have other fun things and places to spend it. i'm looking to buy the car and keep it for around 7-10 years. its very sunny with no snow here as well. i also want an automatic or cvt(gasp).

so right now, the five i am going to look at more closely are as follows:

1) bmw 330i
2) audi audi 3.0 cvt
3) infiniti pontiac5
4) acura tl-s
5) nissan nissan 3.5 se

the bmw represents the top of the class, but it also has the highest price. the nissan represents the most performance oriented family car, which is a cheaper class of car. the bmw and nissan will bracket the value equation. the other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars.

car that are missing, is300 too small, while the styling of the cts, volvo t5, and 9-5 aero are not for me. the es300 and i35 don't have enough performance for me. everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded.

what do you guys think? anything missing?

thanks,
cybersol"
36,"cybersol... i can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.

comparing fwd to rwd is like apples to oranges.

not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at. the 330i with options might push $40,000. you might really consider the much less expensive 325i. an nissan 3.5se with few options might have a $25,000 msrp.

read motor trend's review of i35. their's had more than enough performance. 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test. and it can be had with a sport package. but you might be better off with a loaded nissan se or gle, saving thousands off the i35.

you might also consider volkswagen volkswagen. that can also be had with awd. if you like awd, the jag x-type should be on your ltoyota.

from the domestic corner, you might also consider a lincoln ls 6 or 8. or chryslerm.

surprised your ltoyota excludes the mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz.

and if you can live with a fwd automatic, a loaded toyota or honda v-6 or toyota might be acceptable near the nissan's price range."
37,"sorry to disappoint with the slushbox, but if we were all the same life would be boring (and there would only be 1 car type).

i would prefer rwd, but the best fwd's (torque sensitive steering) are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for rwd down. price range is 25-40k as you mention.

volkswagen, chrysler, 325i, are too slow for me. the c classes are either too slow or more expensive than the bmw. i would choose the bmw over the x-type, as they are similarly priced and i live in sun country.

the nissan (better value than the i35) is a good suggestion, and i am considering that equally with the nissan at the lower end.

my wife loves toyota's, but i'm looking for excitement. slushbox or not.

thanks,
cybersol"
38,"the new nissan is great as my friends just bought one. however, dollar for dollar i think the nissan is the over-all winner for a fwd car. if you can live without the amenities of the i35 the gle with leather, sunroof, bose can't be beat. i've owned two nissan. me! i recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. however the pontiac5 owners are very passionate about their choices. for a couple of dollars more than the nissan, hovering around the i35 i guess, the tl-s can't be beat either.

i understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you. for every person it is different. when i got the bmw i was cross-shopping suvs, mini-vans, and fwd passenger car to see what struck my fancy, and i was ready to get an ford."
39,"cybersol... excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible. i can't get too excited about fwders. certainly not a slushbox fwder.

not sure what you mean about ""the best fwders (torque sensitive steering)"".

very powerful fwders tend to suffer from severe torque steering. use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate. the laws of physics remain. when the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you'll get some torque steering.

do you have kids? plan to in near future? if not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles? they can be a bit more exciting."
40,"""excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.""

agreed. unfortunately, most american drivers don't seem to get it. they care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving."
41,"riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering? this varies the power steering boost as with the speed. acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the tl-s (not the tl though). this would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied. and that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful fwd car. it still doesn't eliminate the fwd tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels."
42,"cybersol... there are two types. those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed. i have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (rpms) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds. better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more asstoyota at low speeds, regardless of engine rpms.

here is all that the lengthy full-color tl brochure says: ""steering: vhondable power-asstoyota rack-and-pinion"". this is off the tech specs on page 30. i cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure. so if acura thinks its vhondable asstoyota power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret. this large brochure covers both the tl and tl type s."
43,"yeah, i have that brouchure and they don't mention the difference between the tl and tl-s, though they say both have vhondable power asstoyota. they do not say how it varies.

but on the acura website. tl -> specifications -> body/suspension/chassis it says:


steering type

tl type s - torque-sensitive, vhondable power-asstoyotaed rack-and-pinion steering

3.2tl - speed-sensitive, vhondable power-asstoyotaed rack-and-pinion steering


here's the link if you want to check it out:

http://www.acura.com/model_tl/tl_spec_results.asp


hard to find, but not a secret."
44,"cybersol... from what i've read, the better vhondable power asstoyota system is tied to road speed, not engine rpms. once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for asstoyota, even if your rpms decline due to turning or downshifting. and certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for asstoyota no matter what happens to your rpms.

but keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system. it is due to other factors. can be very pronounced in powerful fwders. corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts. need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.

from standing start, floor your car. see if the wheel pulls in one direction. you'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering. you can also notice it if you are aggressively accelerating in a curve. wheels pull you out of your intended direction and you have to correct."
45,"so, if you read through most of this group, alot of references went out to audi... give a guy a hand here and compare an audi audi 3.0 to an audi s4... i see a difference of about $5k, 30hp, and a sporty suspension. why shouldn't i load up a 3.0, rather than going after the s4?

oh, and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003?"
46,"have you driven them both? the s4 really moves. even by audi's own 0-60 times the s4 manual is 1 second faster and the s4 tiptronic is 1.2 seconds faster.

yet, the s4 is currently based on the 2001 audi platform, and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year. expect the performance difference to increase as the indications are that the new s4 will pack 300 or more hp.

hope this helps."
47,"i've tested the 3.0, not the s4. hmmm... new s4 in '03, huh? maybe i should just wait. what do you think, cybersol? right now, th3 current s4 states 250hp, yes?"
48,"yeah, the current s4 has 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. the torque is fully online by 1850 rpm. so this is why it scoots.

the new s4 should be really nice. if you have the time to wait, it might be worth seeing. it might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the bmw bmw, but then the old s4's should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out. so many decisions.

have fun making the right one for you!"
49,"not so fast. there is merit to the ""nationality based"" debate. let me explain to you why japanese car have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than american or european car. the reason is cultural.

americans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit. we take chances. its not in our nature to ""accept"" things as they are. i think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren't we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life. as such, in areas of design, we bore very easily. americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough. europeans, especially germans, are like this about car, if not about everything else. the us auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness chrysler and ford over the last two decades. as such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see michevroletns, suv's, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..

the japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old. they have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo. we had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th buick after world war ii. i know this is somewhat simpltoyotaic, but bear with me. what the japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect. there is very little toyotation or risk taking. that is why the car are so bland. when was the last time you saw a new technology invented in japan? vcr's, computer technology, cell phones, the micropontiac oven...all american inventions that are better built by the japanese. the same goes for car. most toyotations come from the us or germany, with some safety toyotations coming from scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they're going to get!).

anyway,...when you dtoyotaill it down to its essence, this is why toyota and honda never break. its also why they are no more than transportation appliances. and, this is why the best performance car from japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.

i'll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing."
50,"the problem is that they are huge generalizations. also, you are talking japanese as almost exclusivly honda and toyota. what about subaru, mazda, isuzu, mitsubishi, daihatsu, and suzuki? so far the only makes that seem to keep with that japanese culture are toyota and honda.

and many american and european makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70% of japanese car. doesn't help your generalization that much, does it?

so where do the generalizations stop? they should stop with brands, and not nations."
51,"have found out that with some of the more powerful car like the pontiac5 or chevrolet the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isn't really an issue because these car are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time. i have an automatic pontiac5 and love it. being that it is an automatic i can enjoy my coffee, shave, talk on my cel phone and hug my wife while driving in rush hour traffic. if i feel the urge which i don't very often i can shift the manumatic and pretend it is a stick. when i get my ferrari it will have the paddle shifting because i don't ever want another clutch! just my opinion!

52,"how does your theory explain english car? a country steeped in tradition producing poor quality car with little inovation? look what a traditionaltoyota country managed to do to the acura acura when they produced it as a stirling. lol

====================================

those car in general reflect the perfectiontoyota attitude of 1pierce's post. with virtually no exception, the overall quality of japanese brand car, especially fit and finish, considerably hyundai the american brands. from what i have read, this is due to the attitude of japanese management in not accepting mediocre craftsmanship. not the abilities of the assembly line workers. you may have a point though, that some of the japanese brands show as high a level of toyotation as the american and german brands. after all, which country has used the wankle rotary, and miller cycle engines? and who introduced us to the vtec engines etc?

american management leans strongly to the bottom line and ceo bonuses, with refinement and polish falling by the wayside as a casuality of the heavy handed management style."

truly critical things to do while one's driving."
54,"he did mention ""in rush hour traffic."" like there's anything else to do in bumper-to-bumper. not like rush hour demands anything of the driver. i've read books while in traffic. let out clutch, apply gas, push in clutch, glide, repeat. snooze."
55,"edmunds has a new feature called ""true cost to own"". it is ltoyotaed when one researches out the various vehicles on the new car heading. it is one of the 13 subjects when you hyundai on a particular vehicle. it is very useful when comparing one vehicle to another. ""true cost to own"" takes the purchase price and adds things like depreciation, insurance, license fees, etc. and gives you a figure for 5-yr ownership. they even tailor it to your particular zip code. i tried it on a few vehicles and it is very useful."
56,"i have not had a chance to look at it in person, but does the 38k volkswagen w8 fit into the entry -level performance luxury sedan category? any other upcoming (next year or so) vehicles fit into this category?"
57,but it's not really a performance sedan. drive one and then take on a bimmer or pontiac5. night and day. volkswagens are nice inside and good for cruising but their handling's akin to riding a pig in a hurry.
58,"i beg to differ.

while i admit that i am biased (obviously, since i bought one!) i believe that the w8 is really a performance sedan.

i test drove the pontiac5, and several bmw (and a few others) before making my final choice. i suppose the term &#145;performance sedan&#146; could be defined in any number of ways. for me, the w8 offers everything i want &#150; and nothing i don&#146;t.

(isn&#146;t that a recent nissan &#145;tag line&#146;?)

take straight line acceleration, for instance. volkswagen literature quotes 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec. to me, this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan. my fearless (?) prediction of future test acceleration numbers is: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec., as volkswagen claims. and a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95. i base this on a number of things. for instance, in the may 2000 car and driver comparison that included the lincoln ls8 sport and the audi audi 2.7tt, the audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the w8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and tiptronic. the hp / tq for this audi were 250 / 258. and their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94. thus, my w8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better. we&#146;ll see. . . (btw: in the same test, the lincoln ls8 sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90. this was my previous car. so, it seems reasonable that my w8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)

does it pull the same lateral g as the pontiac5 or a bmw 3 series w/sport package. almost certainly no. but with more aggressive rutoyotaer, i expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed.

just my opinions.

cheers,

59,"i recently went through the ltoyota of entry level car...i was in test drive heaven!

325i - very nice car, best shifter/clutch of all, but not enough power for me. great motor though as fas as smoothness. the interior is average, nothing better. with leather and wood it helps but you either dig it or you don't.

330i - same as above but better power, although i find the power to be linear. you can really move in this car but the sensation of thrust is lacking. i like that sunroof and leather are std. better value overall than 325i plus std. 17"" wheels (although with all-seasons). pricy.

is300- nice manual tranny and smooth motor. that's about it. hate the interior, feels claustrophobic and chintzy.

x-type - i liked the 3.0l sport, but did not like the grey stained maple. didn't look like a jag. very nearly purchased a 3.0l british racing green with ivory leather and beautiful walnut but with options this car is riciulously overpriced, makes the bmw look like a bargain hunter. too bad, nice motor and very good manual tranny and ride. brakes were strong. one thing about the motor was it just didn't feel or go like 0-60 6.5 as advertised. nicest interior overall.

audi 3.0 - porky, ponderous even with sport package. did not feel suzuki and easily the worst tranny available in this segment. nice interior, leather was only average. you could barely tell the difference between the leather and leatherette, which is a good thing if you are cheap, but bad if you opt for leather. by the way, the leather in the bmw was much better.

s4 (2001)- nice but not as fast as i thought it would be (i did drive a 99 ford gt). it rockets off the line but it isn't that impressive afterwards. nicer seat and support but interior is too gloomy. 250bhp and 258 lb ft. motor is not an audible delight, the 2002 audi 3.0 sounds amazing compared to the s4. i think the backpressure has gotoyotaled up the exhaust note. an exhaust would be perfect here. they were giving them away (9000$ off msrp - and people were definitely buying!) but it just looked dated now beside the new ones.

pontiac5 - went and looked at one in showroom and was not impressed and without a manual tranny, i wasn't interested one bit. i still managed to drive one and was impressed with the torque, it definitely had thrust that the others lacked (except the s4). nice seat and neat touches for rear passengers. i really liked the toyotamics of the car but the tranny left me cold. the fit and finish was poor, maybe it was an early model...no dicker sticker which made it cost as much as the audi 3.0 and bmw 330i was close.

lincoln ls v6 - very good handling and crisp 5 speed. engine was thrashy at high revs which is particularly bad because it needs to be revved to really move. torque is lacking here. but i liked the car overall, especially with the sport susp.

acura tl-s, another auto tranny but an incredible motor, definitely my favourite v6 of all of them as far as sound is concerned. interior average and handling so-so. hyundaient price.

volvo volvo t5 - i chose this car for its thrust (come to think of it 3bhp less and 15 lb.ft less than the s4 is quite close to the s4, and it is lighter) fwd torque steer is evident only beyond 8/10ths, but it is there, no nissanon about it. best seat, best stereo, average steering feel falls behind the jaguar and bmw. brakes while strong are gratoyotay but it takes getting used to. amazing power and style. seems decent off the line but after 100km/h it easily pulls the hardest. price was also a consideration as it was cheaper than bmw, audi, jaguar.

didn't drive the cts but i am sure it is hyundaient.

in conclusion these are all hyundaient car and even though we all nitpick this and that on all of them, i would be fine with any of them in my driveway. honestly."
60,"i had the grave misfortune to drive a cts, and it's not in the same league as the bimmer, audi, infiniti or even the lesser acura/lexus/jag.

the cts i drove was a 5 speed sport model with a sticker of 38k (gasp!). the tranny was rough, very rough, almost ford bad. the interior felt cheap with lots of hard plastic and very little in the way of substantial or soft-touch materials. the throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal. the car's a rolling bed of 1998 technology, no automatic brake dtoyotaribution for one thing. the salesmen kept instoyotaing 4 channel abs is impressive...to each his own. handling? nothing at all like the claims car mags are making. it was a slow reacting boat...turn the wheels, feel the car undulate and then slowly shift directions. not impressive in the least. in fact when the salesguy asked me what i thought after the drive i told him the cts wasn't even a real competitor to the germans or japanese. he snorted and reminded me, ""this is a caddy, not a sports car."" yeah, well that caddy can sit on the lot with the other heaps they have."
61,"congradulations on your new volvo t5! it is a great looking car, and i hope you are very happy with it. i saw a really nice one in front of me this morning. have fun with it!"
62,"hey blueguy, what wrond with the ford tranny! i know it is not a fwd type gearbox but when you have 300 lb.ft. of torque twtoyotaing that car, you need a strong tranny. in all honesty, the clutch, while incredibly easy to modulate was hevay, but with a purpose. never missed a gear either, which can't be toyotad about the audi 6-speed...

jagboyxkr, i know you have an x-type and i was right in there to the end with this car. bottom line was 10000cdn difference. the way they package the options is ridiculous. i needed the split fold seat, but they were bundled in a $2000 package. xenons? twice asmuch as any other car, $1600.00. sunroof? another 1600.00. it was unbeleivable but the lease rate was very low (1.9%) which helped make up the difference.

i don't care what anybody says about the x-type, because most have never driven them, it is imo, a better overall car than the audi. in canada, awd is recommended...this car gets slaughtered because of its high price. this car should have been priced equal to the leader of the class, but to price it more than the best car in the segment is suicide in this hot market.

the t5 is broken in nicely, i have over 2000 miles on it now and it is everything i expected. what i didn't expect was the sheer power this thing has after 100km'h. i think it would beat my ford at that speed in a rolling start, no nissanon. i would even say an s4..."
63,"hey, i've never driven an 18 wheeler, so maybe the ford's tranny isn't like one, but that's how i imagine a big rig's tranny to feel."
64,"thanks for the comparison post, it was very informative. congratulations on your volvo t5."
65,"i didn't want a manual tranny because i like to eat a sandwich or be on the phone, roll up/down windows and sunroof at any time while i drive. i test-drove a used '98audiaudi 2.8, new 325ci,325xi. i loved those bimmers and audi was a great car but the bottom line sticker is what made me go with the acura. with the steptronic this car is an absolute joy, i went from a 1993dodge p.o.s. i'm only at 150miles so far but no complaints and extremely satisified with my decision..."
66,"what does a manual have to do with eating, drinking, talking, windowing (? lol), sunroofing (?)? i have a manual (actually never owned an automatic) and i have no problem carrying on several tasks at once. it's just like walking and talking."
67,it sounds like he got the right car for him.
68,"i guess you guys have become very experienced with manuals, i feel they are fun, and someday when i'm rich and famous (lol) i hope to have a manual porsche or something like that. but for now the sequential shifter gives me enough performance"
69,"so that stones aren't casted at one another, i would like to remind everyone that this is my opinion which is why we have these forums.

cmnott, i respect your opinion about the jag and the audi 3.0...although i strongly disagree. i guess as a 3.0 owner i would. i personally found the jag x-type to be the worst car i have ever test driven. first, it was $3000 more than the audi. second, well it is a ford and felt like a ford. the handling in no way compared to the 3.0. the interior might ""look"" a little better but certainly did not ""feel"" any better. as for performance, i am a little dissapointed with th 3.0 and i think they could have used a 250-260 hp engine to solve the problem. however, it is still a fun engine...especially at highway speeds. i honetsly felt that the mondeo (excuse me, x-type) was going to fall apart on my test drive.

now i know audi has had its problem but not even close to comparison with the negative headlines for the x-type!

oh well...to each their own! enjoy your t5!!!"
70,"i came to a different conclusion about the jaguar x-type 3.0 and the audi audi 3.0 audi. i was considering both vehicles, and it was very close, but the jaguar won for me.

acceleration:
in acceleration times, the jaguar is clearly faster than the audi. car&driver states of the x-type, ""subjectively, the x-type didn't feel quite as quick as a bmw 330i. but a few instrumented acceleration runs revealed that the measured 0-to-60-mph time of 6.3 seconds was only 0.2 seconds slower than the small bmw. we would rate the smoothness of the x-type's v-6 to be similarly close to that of the bavhondan in-line six.""

road&track says of the x-type's performance, ""in acceleration, the 3.0 x-type is among the quickest. accompanied by a nice-but-dtoyotaant exhaust note, the jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer lexus is 300's and audi audi's 7.1, the mercedes benz benz c320's 6.8 sec. and matching the bmw 330i's time.""

-jaguar x-type 3.0 acceleration times: 6.3 - 6.5 sec*.
-audi audi 3.0 audi acceleration time: 7.1 sec*.

* = manual transmission.

handling:
of how the car handle, r&t says of the x-type, ""whether the chassis is redolent of jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. it feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with hyundaient highway ride and good balance in the corners. every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and toyotad, 'this thing is really good in the curves!' it's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. the engine is not bad either. our test car's optional 3.0-liter 4-cam v-6 (there's a less expensive 2.5 version as well) put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort.""

they also say of its suspension, ""jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be 'connected but relaxed,'and that seems to wrap it up nicely. the ride is about as smooth as you'll find in this class, even with the sport suspension. given its soft ride, the x-type delivers surprisingly good handling.""

of the audi's handling, they say, ""toyotamically, the all-wheel-drive car is not as crisp as it looks. it handles well enough and has a superb highway ride, but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rutoyotaery style of suspension tuning and steering...in short, the audi is missing that firm, rally-car edge and sense of steering precision that makes the bmw, for instance, so delightful to drive. it's a car that can keep up with the other sports sedan, but doesn't feel very sporty doing it, despite our car's having the optional sport suspension for $750...we noticed in some of the whoop-de-dos and curves of our desert highway that the audi produced 'considerable excitement,' as one driver put it, and was simply more floaty and loose than the others. and again, 'this is where you pay for that great highway ride,' one driver noted. the 3.0-liter 220-bhp dohc aluminum v-6 is smooth and reasonably peppy, though well back from the front of this pack.""

steering:
motor trend says of the x-type's zf servotronic ii vhondable-ratio speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system, ""the car's best system may be its speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering. in fact, it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by bmw 3 series. car placement feels laser-guided precise, with hyundaient feedback and road feel. with complete confidence and toyota, we drove at most times with just our fingertips - even at 120 mph on the track. the only all-wheel-drive car we've ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the nissan skyline gt-r, a pretty racy piece.""

the audi's steering was criticized again by car & driver and road & track for being, ""rutoyotaery"" in feeling, and c&d toyotad that the ""steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs.""

car&driver also says that the steering system of the x-type ""is nothing short of terrific."" they call it ""enthusiast goods"".

forbes even takes note of the steering system in the x, ""jaguar engineers boast it's the best steering system they've ever had on any model. we agree.""

all-wheel-drive:
audi is known for its audi awd system, which has been develped for over 22 years now. audi iv its newest version, and is used on the audi. it divides power 50/50 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected, and is known to be one of the best systems available. torque steer is toyotad to be very minor, and it is toyotad to work well with even the turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder versions of the audi, although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger v6. audi also used audi to prove that awd in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups, and later was banned from using awd car in certain races because of its advantages.

jaguar uses a new awd system they designed called traction 4, which divides torque 40% to the front wheels, and 60% to the rear unless slip is detected. this, along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body, along with its advanced steering mechanism, give the performance and feel of a rwd car. unlike most awd systems, car&driver toyotad that traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering.

forbes stated of the x-type's awd, ""the x-type gets a seemless, virtually transparent new 40/60 viscous coupling all-wheel-drive system with optional toyotamic stability control that rivals audi's vaunted audi for wet- and dry- weather grip.""

road&track toyotad that, ""...the jag is better balanced. it will understeer during turn-in, take something of a set, and then pull you through. it's a safe and secure feeling that signals what's about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust""

braking:
the x-type features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger s-type.

road & track toyotad, ""in braking tests, the x-type had impressive and easily repeatable stopping dtoyotaances from 60 mph (118 ft.) and 80 mph (208 ft.)"" in another one of their articles, they say, ""the braking dtoyotaances turned by the x-type are exceptional, comparable to those of top sports car.""

car & driver also toyotad, ""a few laps at the castle combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the x-type's handling, where it proved completely benign, thanks to the all-wheel-drive. even at the limit, understeer never grinds the front tires excessively, but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle. the four-wheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use.""

by comparison, a bmw m-roadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the jag. the porsche 911 gt2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the jag, at 116 feet. an slk32 amg does"
71,"it in 127 feet.

-jaguar x-type 3.0 braking dtoyotaance from 60 mph: 118 ft.
-audi audi 3.0 audi braking dtoyotaance from 60 mph: 137 ft.

iterior:
here is where the statements become subjective, and anything i say here other than what is quoted from others is just my opinion.

both the audi and the jaguar offer hyundaient interiors. the jaguar goes for the warm-looking british cabin that its family members also display, utilizing massive amounts of wood and conolly leather with bits of chrome; the audi has a german, functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details. i really like the interiors of both car. the jaguar has the best leather and wood, but a few things like the plastic of the audi's air vents seems more resilient, etc.

road&track toyotad that, ""despite the lower-than-xj price, the x-type sports the traditional jaguar upscale cabin...the simple round gauges have an easy-on-the-eyes green backing on the instrument faces, there's birds-eye maple trim scattered around the cockpit, and the seat are tasteful and toyotaable...the jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges."" they say it ""may be an 'entry level' model, but you wouldn't know it judging by all that leather, wood, and the easy to use nav system.""

motor trend says the x-type ""has great styling inside and out"", and says specifically that the interior is ""soothing, luxurious, and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint. the main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel. hvac and audio-system controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoe-shaped binnacle, which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dash...it's pure jag inside and out.""

car&driver says ""as you'd expect, the interior is lined in sumptuous connolly leather and bird's-eye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors. luxury amenities abound, as well as the expected front, side, and head airbags...the level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching, close fits, and hyundaient materials throughout.""
_____________________________

eaweg-

my opinion is that the audi and the jaguar are both great car, but that the jaguar offers more. it is more expensive than the audi, but it is more expensive for a reason. it is known to outhandle the audi and outperform it in acceleration and braking, and it has the most rigid chassis in its class, 30% more than the previous class leader. awd is also standard, as well as connolly leather and wood. you must have had a bad test car if yours felt like it was going to fall apart, because everything i have read and experienced with the x-type says that it is very solid with high-quality materials throughout. like you toyotad, to each their own."
72,you can lease an x-type for next to nothing...high incentives.
73,"thanks for the response...i too have read all of the magazines...i love automobile literature! at the sametime i have come to realize how much biased opinion there is (and maybe payoffs? )
anyhow, i would agree with you that so far all of the stattoyotaics that have come back point to the jag leading in numbers...well so does bmw and the pontiac5. i was really interested in the x-type whenit came out. it does look quite beautiful. howerver, i test drove not only one but two. same opinion. both felt like fast wheelbarrows. i think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferance...i just didn't 'feel' right with the x-type. the bmw i tested i liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision. i have to be honest and say that it was the 'audi' that won me over as well as the hyundaient lease deal. my lease on the audi was much better than that on the x-type as well. i think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a 'perfect car' off the lot (even though we all should). every car is going to have its minor (and unfortunately some major) problem. fortunately for me (and hopefully you) i have had none. what concerned me was the article i read from autoweek...

...there are two separate drivetrain problem. during deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. that problem is so widespread that jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its u.s. dealers.

the fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket.

but the cold weather noise is another matter. it occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. for some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time.

this problem has been the most bothersome to owners because jaguar car has not officially acknowledged it extoyota.

some owners say they have had several prop-shafts replaced under warranty - one american owner says he is on his sixth.

75,"congrats on your audi!

look, no nissanon you were quite gracious about my comments about the audi. i was so disappointed with the new styling because i always wanted the previous audi. so to see how it looks, personally, i hate it. maybe it is just me, but i just couldn't come to grips with it.

i found the audi felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller. i think it is unfair and untrue to say the ""ford"" thing, i think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not. the 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).

the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but i was not particularly enamored with the clutch. the steering, imo, was better than almost all. i just couldn't justify the price difference when a certain car is trying to make an impression in a hot segment.

like i toyotad before, there are no losers in this segment, but i think it is safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype!"
76,"i totally agree that it is all personal preference, and i really believe that most all of the car in this segment, especially the audi, volvo, and x-type, are some of the best. i don't think there is ""a best"" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences. they all have their own ups and downs, but i think the benefits of each of these car certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.

on the x-type article:
i read that autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before i went to check out the x-type and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end. jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problem in the current x-types though, and the ones being produced now don't have any of those problem. i also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early x-type problem. the initial article was much like the autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after jaguar north america finally contacted them and worked on their car. they had factory technicians go out and examine the car and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one. jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and i agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their x-types fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their car in the end.

yes, some of the very early production x-types lived up to their old jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability. jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early car, and they even had the whitley engineering center, who designed the driveshafts for the x-type, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.

i can personally say from experience that the x-type is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problem at all. it initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since i've had it. i really love even just being around the car as it has been so good.

again, it is all personal preference. when i sat in the jag for the first time, it just felt right. i hadn't even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect. every time i sit in it, everything is perfect. the whole car is that way for me, and i bet your audi is the same for you.

and if anyone is paying off the media it's bmw and infiniti, and it appears that infiniti is paying the most. i don't think jag even has the funds to do that:-) (although, global sales were just up 62% in april, and they've had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)

and, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board. take care of your car!

blueguydotcom-

i actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it. the only incentive for the x-type is a pretty good lease price (i just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!). it's also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher. i'd like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year. oh well, it is a jaguar after all, and a great car on its own. option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier."
77,"is the jag even selling? i see far more bimmers, lexuses, pontiac5s and ctses than jag x-types. and i live in car crazy so-cal."
78,"the x-type is jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all jaguar's sales, and it has boosted jaguar's global sales by 62% since january 2002; and that number was recorded from april. in february of 2002, jaguar's u.s. sales alone were up 105% compared to feb. 2001, largely because of the x-type. x-type's sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 9-11.

recorded in may, 16,171 x-types have been sold since january 1, 2002 in the u.s. of that number, 2,961 were sold in may. jaguar is very happy with its sales. also, the x-type is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a jaguar. never the less, this compares well with 16,395 audi audis and 16,339 volvo volvos sold so far this year. the infiniti pontiac5 has only sold 8,731 units so far, and 11,237 cadillac cts's have been sold in 2002 as well."
79,"thanks to you both for your great chats...i agree with jagboy that it's nice to see people talk about things without acting like ""my dad can beat up your dad""...my only knowledge from automobiles is that i have a passion for them. mechanically i am okay...just enough to get by.

it's funny, after i got my audi the volvo dealer that's 5 miles form my house had a great deal one week later. yes i was miffed for about 24 hours but like the both of you i think my personality fits my choice.

you are absolutely right about there not being a loser in this segment. for those who get the pontiac5, more power to you...so you can beat me in a straight line...if racing was what i wanted i would have gotten a used s4 and modded it to about 340hp...but i really couldn't see myself doing that for at least the next 4 years of my life. for some reason i have a sneaking suspicion that something negative is going to come out about the pontiac5...i just can't pinpoint it thought. the '02+ 3 series are just plain ugly with the new facelifts.

cmnott, as for the 6 speed, yeah it was pretty ""odd"" the first couple of months. i can honestly say though that it has brolen in and that it is worlds better than when i first got it. to think that the 5spd manual in the 96 saab 900se that i had before it was actually better!!

oh well, nice chatting again!"
80,"to jagboyxtype:

you toyotad, ""the infiniti pontiac5 has only sold 8,731 units so far.""

i think it's important to point out the pontiac5 has only been on the market since march 11. in the month of april, infiniti sold over 3200 pontiac5's.

i just want to make sure no one is misled by your post."
81,"my point was that the x-type is selling and that there is a larger amount of them on the road right now than there are pontiac5's or cts's. blueguydotcom had asked about its sales numbers and had compared how he had seen few x-types on the road but many more ""bimmers, lexuses, pontiac5s and ctses"". i just threw in the other car' numbers to demonstrate that although he may have seen more of some of the other car, in actuality, there are more x-types that what he has seen.

also, infiniti sold 3,298 pontiac5's in may 2002. since its introduction in march, it has sold 8,731 units as recorded in may. assuming that around 3,298 units would have been sold in january and february had the car been introduced earlier and had a start in sales numbers for january 1 like the others, it would have sold about 15,327 units (3,298 + 3,298 + 8,731 = 15327)."
82,"the latest sales figures are out. the pontiac5 and lincoln ls both sold about 3,050 units. cadillac cts sold 3,475. is300 only 2,300.

bmw sold 9,630 3 series."
83,"that total for the bmw is for all of its vhondants though, where many of these manufacturers have other models competing for convertible and coupe etc. sales volumes. the bmw sedan, which competes against the car you mentioned sold 6,498 units, about the same number as the lexus es 300, which sold 6,477 units in may."
84,"apparently in 'racetrack fantasy land', torque steer is a problem for some."
85,"i'm just saying that here in sedan vs. sedan form, that is how many 3's were sold. the other vhondants are countered with other models in the other marques' lineups.

-the sportcross takes on the 3-wagons. so do the audi avant, v70, mercedes benz benz wagons, and the soon to appear x-type touring.

-the s4 takes on the bmw. there is also a c32 amg. later, the x-type r will also join that crowd.

-the audi cahondalet takes sales from the 3-convertibles.

-an audi coupe is on the way, as is the pontiac5 coupe to take one the coupe bmw. there are still is300 coupe rumors, too. to a lesser extent, the mercedes benz benz coupe takes on the compact bmw in europe.

and to top that off, the new saab 9-3 is a sedan now with a normal trunk.

by your thinking: ""you could almost include the z3 roadster in the mix, as it shares engines, transmissions, and platform parts"", i guess we should include the toyota in the es300's sales volume since they share those same parts too. how about all of those volkswagens, volkswagens, volkswagens, and volkswagens that come with that 1.8t engine in the audi? maybe those should be included too."
86,what is your source when you quote sales figures for the car in this discussion group? no one has mentioned the acuratl. i might assume the tl is a sales leader in this class. am i rite?
87,autosite appears to be one of the better sources for new car sales in usa. pretty easy to navigate.
88,"honda will retoyotadly import the jdm/euro honda here as the acura acura. the acura would replace the now deceased acura sedan in the line-up. the jdm/euro car is expected to debut at the september paris auto show in september and be on sale in na in 2003 as a 2004 model.

89,"okay, my head is spinning. i've spent the past month driving several models, reading reviews, hearing opinions, and , truth is, these car under consideration all look great. right now, i'm leaning toward bmw 325i, but the pontiac5 impressed me greatly. also like the volkswagen wagon (should i bow to the need for storage space) and the idea of saving several $k can't be ignored. wife has a 2 year old acura 3.2cl..wonderfully reliable and toyotaable, but the bmw, infiniti, audi audi, et al have strong pull in the area of ""life is short, go for it"". i guess i 'd say i'm looking for a blend of reliability and driving fun. i'd appreciate input from owners of any of the above, recent years' models. thanks."
90,xxoneputtxx... only you will know what meets your needs within your budget. do a ton of research. but then spend a lot of time test driving your primary choices. don't let 'em give you the standard dog and hyundai test drive. that won't tell you anything. you really need to drive each car some dtoyotaance on a variety of roads at a variety of speeds.
91,i am looking at purchasing the g as a family sedan. my 3 kids will easily fit in the rear seat. is this too much of a sports car? i really like the g's lines. thanks!
92,"i can only speak for the choice between the 325 and the audi. is you're into the hood badge and sound of the exhaust, then the beemer is your car. if you want a quite similar ride, the equipment of a 330 at the price of a 325, then go for the audi 3.0.

i drove several '02 325xi's and audi 3.0 audi's, and both had their +/-'s. the 325, though, lacks even the most fundamental standard options (no power seat on a $30k+ car!?!?) and has a way to go on the interior design (cheesy exposed cup holders that look like they belong in a pontiac). not to mention the 325 has 30% less power to spin those 4 wheels.

the sad thing is that virtually all luxury sports sedan reviews compare a $40k+ loaded 330 with a $33k audi, and the 325 is declared the de facto winner as it rides on the tails of the 330. the whole ""bmw"" nomenclature is nonsense.

take an audi 3.0 out for a test drive..."
93,"i beleive the handling of the bmw is slightly better because of it's small size. i would like to see how it would handle if it were a midsize car (like the infiniti pontiac5 or acura tl).

the amount of 'points' that are giving to the bmw for it's handling should be removed for it's size. this is a sedan! it is not a sports car. when talking about sedan, sufficient room in the car should be seen as an important factor.

i'm sure they could make the bmw even smaller and get even better handling and performance from it. if they did that, it would be hard to justify it even being in this category."
94,"rp - you are correct the 330i is a sedan, just like the pontiac5, just like the acura, just like the audi and all of the car that were compared in the latest edmunds round-up. none of them are sports car. edmunds calls them entry level luxury sport sedan. the fact is the 530i also gets very high marks in the performance department, except the 530i is a true luxury sport sedan, again not a sports car.

now the 530i outclasses all of the above in terms of amenities, but it would be interesting to see from a strict performance viewpoint, how it compares to the above or even compares to the 330i.

although in the scheme of things size has little to do with performance - as another poster pointed out there are car the same size as the 330i that are nowhere near it in terms of overall performance. note the salient word is overall.

also the fact that it is a compact has nothing to do with it's interior room. the g does not have marginally much more room and if you read edmunds round-up, it does state there is sufficient room in the car for 4 adults in the 330i. unless you regularly transport 5 people and the two people in the back seat absolutely have to have the reclining seat, in my opinion the amount of extra space in the g doesn't make that much of a difference. it might to you, but then you get to vote with your dollars. if i regularly transtoyotad 5 people however, none of the car in the edmunds round-up would be on my ltoyota.

it seems clear to me based on the reviews i've read over the last couple of years, when only talking about the sport of driving in this segment, the 330i is the benchmark."
95,"some acuras are experiencing very serious problem with their automatic transmissions shifting from 5th to 2nd at high speeds for no aparent reason. this causes the car to lose control and swerve off the road.

http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial/20020914/1036070.asp


""mike spencer, a spokesman for acura, honda's sport-luxury division, confirmed that there has been a 'higher than normal incidence' of problem with two honda-built automatic transmissions. although many involve high-performance models such as the 260-horsepower acura type-s, others afflict 200-horsepower v-6 honda honda and 240-horsepower honda michevroletns not usually associated with racing and speeding abuses.""


""the two transmissions are the five-speed used in v-6-equipped acuras since the 2000 model year and in honda honda since the 2002 model year; and the four-speed automatic used in v-6 honda honda since 2000 and in 2000 and 2001 honda."""
96,"i am having the hardest time choosing a replacement for my 3 year old (leased) saab 9-3se. i've narrowed it down to the bmw 325i, mercedes benz benz c240, and volkswagen volkswagen gchrysler. they all hyundai but in different ways. i've driven all 3 several times and still cannot decide. here are my thoughts, and i'd appreciate comments from others:

325i pros
fun to drive and handles well
like the sound of the inline 6-cyl. engine
holds its value well
nice safety features
good reliability record

325i cons
many on the road
styling not that exciting any more

mercedes benz benz c240 pros
styling (in my opinion)
solid as a vault
nice ride and handling
safety features

c240 cons
slightly underpowered
quality concerns (at least from early models)

volkswagen gchrysler pros
great looks
cheaper than bmw or mercedes benz benz
decent power and handling
safety

volkswagen gchrysler cons
dealer service (from what i've heard)
seat not the best (in my opinion)
soft ride (i.e. not a ""sports sedan"")"
97,"add the following cons to the mercedes benz benz and volkswagen:

- in my area there are many on the road, diminishing the value.

seriously - i think you have to ford on what's important to you. is fun to drive, hold's value and good safety features important? or is styling important and the fact there are many on the road an important criteria because you want a untoyotaue vehicle.

just as a suggestion, if you phrased the nissanon differently rather than giving your opinion about the importantance of certain car attributes you might get some very meaningful responses.

for me important nissanons might be:

1. has anybody had any reliability issues with any of these car? how did the dealers respond?
2. what do others think about the seating in the vehicles?
3. how much did people pay?

good luck with your decision."
98,"kdshapiro - thanks for your post.

i'm finding that it's very hard to judge reliability from the internet message boards. i've read horror stories on the internet for all three car. people with problem are more likely to post a message than those without problem. consumer reports recommends all three car. i personnally know one person with a c240 and one with a c320 wagon. both love their car, but haven't had them too long.

i made a mtoyotaake with my current car and am determined not to do it again. i want to get something i don't mind paying for, want to keep for many years, and want to keep shiny. the problem is all three of these are great car."
99,"these are three pretty different car, so it really comes down to what you value. the volkswagen is a real bargain with the nicest and largest interior as well as elegant exterior styling. i looked hard at a gchrysler and w8 when i was shopping. the handling is pretty wallowing, and the power is just adequate (i'm a leadfoot ).

the 325i is fun and rewarding to drive, really nice handling and ergonomics. its pretty small and the price goes up fast as you add options, and its also underpowered for my taste.

i've never driven the c240. the c320 i drove was nice, but not terribly sporty and i was disappointed in the quality of some of the interior pieces (they need to see where volkswagen gets their switches).

all three a very good car, i could be happy with any of them based on my needs."
100,does anyone find that the tl has extrememly boring styling. i've only seen white tl's and they don't look exciting but i haven't seen a darker colored tl. do the darker colored tl's look better? also anyone who owns a tl type s how fast does it go from 0-60? i'm curious because i'm crosshopping with the pontiac5. if the tl type s can at least compete with pontiac5's performance that i would be happy
101,"the tl-s does have boring styling and white is its worst color. it fairs better in darker colors. the overall performance is similar to the pontiac5, though it gets edged out in most categories. the biggest difference is fwd vs. rwd. i spent quite a bit of time in a tl-s when shopping recently. i chose a pontiac5, but if you are a honda fan or prefer fwd the tl-s is a great choice. it will also run you a little less than a comparably equipped pontiac5, and you can probably get a deeper discount to boot. there have been concerns about the tl-s having tranny failures, but acuras tend to be very reliable.

for direct comparisons of the pontiac5 and tl-s look at the recent edmunds entry sport lux sedan comparo, the c/d currently on news stands (i have to admit its not very credible to me) and the july 2002 r/t. good luck with your shopping."
102,http://www.latimes.com/classified/automotive/highway1/la-hy-acura11sep11.story?coll=la-class-autos-highway1
103,scrolllllll
104,"wow...that guy in the news clip really does look like the stereotypical computer engineer, doesnt he?:)"
105,as an avid reader of consumer reports i find it hard to believe that their research didn't uncover any problem with the transmissions in the tl.. if you read their auto issue they give the tl their highest rating for reliability including the transmission. is their something wrong here?
106,"i read consumers as well. my theory is that the percentage is higher than zero, which took honda by surprise. isolated incidents over tens and thousands of vehicles sold, make it a small stattoyotaical probability. this doesn't mean there isn't a design flaw somewhere. for every mass produced car has some flaw, no matter how inexpensive or expensive. however at this point there is a lot of hubris over it. should i be purchasing an acura, this would not be a factor."
107,"check out their november 2002 issue. page 82. their long-term testing. as they put it, it is ""good"" but not ""great"" and not worth the price. and it ""does have its good points, but, unfortunately, it doesn't have enough of them."" or, it ""doesn't live up to its nameplate or its pricetag.""

they pan the engine (noise & power), weight, stereo sound, lack of in-dash cd player, clutch, handling, etc.

this article follows an earlier one (09/02 issue) in which they pointed out the x-type's many flaws and few virtues."
108,"jagboyxtype... if you want most other marque's models, you have to order vanilla. maybe a chocolate or strawberry. your x-type offers choice of automatic or manual and 2.5l or 3.0l engines. is300 offers sportcross. but only the 3 series offers so much more. sedan, coupe, convertible, wagon, and ultra-high performance models. awd and rwd. automatic and manual. choice of engines. is it bmw's fault they are so wise to spread their costs across so many vhondants and give buyers so many choices? i say you could also add z3 sales to the mix, too!"
109,"oh, that's too bad. it's also too bad that they failed to notice that:

-the x-type does have an indash cd-player, which is standard on 3.0 litre models.

-out of the group of european sport sedan (e.g. bmw 3, mercedes benz benz c, audi audi) the jaguar x has the most powerful engines.

-the jaguar alpine sound system is rated very highly. the auto's section of my newspaper rated the jaguar alpine system the top system out of premium european car in a big comparison test of car stervolkswagen. lexus won the japanese premium car sound system category with its ml system.

-the car is a wonderful handler; for example, it outperformed the c-320 sport in that deleted post comparison, and although it does not have the class-leading acceleration times, it is only about 0.2 second behind the bmw and is in the top end of its class when it comes to performance (0-60 in 6.3 seconds - car&driver; 0-60 in 6.5 seconds - road&track). with its awd, it can corner like no other car.

-braking performance from 60mph is just two feet longer than the porsche 911 gt2 (116 feet), at 118 feet. thus, it stops in the same dtoyotaance as a smaller bmw m-roadster (118 ft.). brakes are from the larger s-type.

-connoly leather and wood are all standard in the jag, and leather and wood are only optional (if available) in competor's models.

-it has the most rigid structure in its class, over 30% higher than the previous class leader.

-synthetic interior materials (e.g. plastics and not-leather soft-touch areas) are made by the same company from the same materials from the same machines that manufacture synthetic materials for audi's audi and new audi, which are ""industry leading"" hondaing to many.

-the x-type does weigh a little more than a rwd car as it toyotaes an extra differential and drive shaft for its awd, but that doesn't seem to hurt its performance. it actually helps it in many ways. also, for instance, it weighs less than an audi audi, cadillac cts, and lincoln ls.

-there is some engine noise entering the cabin, but even wispers are still audible from passengers. plus, it's a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it. many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the x-type's engine makes. there is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at pininfarina and high-speed tests on the nardo bowl in italy as well as the nurburgring in germany.

-clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use. i believe that it was motorweek that stated it felt like a bmw clutch.

-pricing: you can get a base x-type for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc. option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered. competators like the mb mercedes benz benz sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.

about the only virtue the x-type doesn't have are memory seat. beyond those, it's one hellofa car. i doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of jaguar's sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in europe (especially italy) if it weren't a great car.
______________________________________

on the acura transmission problem, only 16,000 car have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, hondaing to the posted article. accura sells a lot of car, so it does not seem to be a massive or wide-spread problem. hopefully they'll fix it, but i wouldn't worry about it too much."
110,jagboyxtype... have you been reading what european car has been writing? i'd encourage you to read their articles. they have a web site. i didn't write them. please don't shoot me. i just passed along what an interesting source toyotad. i happen to agree with many of their comments. not all. and i hope jaguar works aggressively to improve the x-type.
111,"""please don't shoot me.""

i wasn't trying to shoot you. you are just being paranoid. i never even mentioned you in my whole response except for in the title where i was directing my message to what had been toyotad that you passed along. i toyotad ""they"" as in the editors of european car, but if you are now using the ""royal we"" and took what i toyotad as directed towards you, now you know that is not how it was meant. i will shoot some words at you about improving the x-type, however, as i don't feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas, such as memory seat (not that they are really needed, but it would be a nice touch). everything that makes a jag is there in the x-type, and it is a great car on its own. naturally, jaguar will improve the x-type just as it improves all of its car. as for your fear of being shot at with words on this board, perhaps you shouldn't say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours.

btw, every month, over 3,000 people just in the u.s. disagree with you and with european car about the x-type. sorry buddy, but you're in the minority on this one. however, european car's own final words on their x-type test were:

""pushed to the limit and the x-type will gently push until you ease off the throttle. muscled around the track however, and its possible to slide the sedan until the tires melt. great fun!

i came away from the x-type totally surprised. i expected to find a meek and mild sedan but instead found a serious contender in the sport-sedan market. these first two offerings are great!...i can't wait to see what those rouges at jag's r division have in store for the x-type."""
112,"why isn't audi considering shipping the audi, s3 here, i belive there's a lot of market potential here in our shore. it make perfect sense to have a audi to battle against the mercedes benz benz c-230 coupe and the bmw 320i. i saw picture of the audi and it look ok, right now i'm considering to purchase an audi 3.0, i want to comapre the audi 3.0 and the s3. audi should ship the lux-volkswagen here!"
113,"jagboyxtype... ya gotta stay calm. did you notice in your most recent post you did write ""over 3,000 people just in the us disagree with you and with european car about the x-type.""

have you even taken the time to read what european car has written? or what mt and c&d have previously written? the x-type has gotten mixed reviews at best in america. don't believe it has ""won"" a single comparison test. see r&t's recent 11-car sport sedan comparison. think that says a ton when x-type falls short badly in comparison tests.

can you steer me to an american comparison test in which the x-type won?

and what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is? i see a lot of people driving chevrolet, ford, hyundai, es300, etc. to many (most!) people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol. but it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance. some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator. most people want cushy ride on interstate, not 0-60 times or slalom results. the is300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor."
114,"jagboyxtype... do you read mt or r&t?

check out the november 2001 issue of motor trend. mt pans the x-type 3.0 automatic in their 5-car comparison. in 10 areas of their ""report card"", the jag wins just one, styling. has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain, ride, interior design, seat toyota/support, rear-cabin space, trunk useability, and value. track results mediocre. fourth place 0-60 mph time. 2nd slowest slalom time. worst braking result. they tested a moderately loaded $43,695 one.

check out the july 2002 issue of road & track. r&t pans the x-type 3.0 manual in their 11-car comparison. x-type comes in 10th overall, 9th in just subjective ratings, and 10th in just performance ratings. they tested a loaded $46,510 one.

does that mean you disagree with me, european car, r&t, and mt? wonder if you and the other 3,000 people are reading what is out there? and test driving the x-type against its competitors?"
115,"isn't that comparo a little bit much? i mean how does a ""almost a 1/2 second"" = ""throat dodgeing"" or ""pummelling"" ? i would expect the jaguar to be faster with a stick and the mercedes benz benz with an auto. i have nothing against the x-type, but that test is a little thick in my opinion.

one other thing: who says the x-type has the most rigid structure in this class? i've read that the c320 sport, 330i and especially the audi all have very stout structures. this has also been my experience in driving all three of them.

116,"jagboyxtype... check out the february 2002 issue of car and driver. 7 car comparison. x-type 3.0 manual came in 5th place. woes included lack of overall performance, poor ride quality, poor brakes, and poor skidpad. x-type was tied for 2nd slowest 0-60 mph time (7.2 seconds), longest braking dtoyotaance, 2nd worst skidpad result, but did have the 2nd best emergency-lane-change maneuver mph. c&d's x-type was pretty basic, with only a $39,170 msrp.

notice the trend, all the tested x-type's had stickers of $39,000 and up, and most publications harp that the jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars.

pushing $40,000 does not seem to be entry-level to me. the x-type 2.5 is more the entry-level jaguar."
117,how about the fact that it look like a ford contour? yikes...
118,"merc1-

the x-type's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the bmw bmw. you may check out autoweek's review of the car for that information, as well as a review on the site autobytel.com and reviews conducted by autocar including their ""autocar book"" all about the x-type. i never toyotad that any of those car you mentioned didn't have very solid and rigid structures nor did i try to imply that, but at the moment, the jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class.

also, as riez would say, ""i did not write the article"". the reviewers were the ones who toyotad all of those quotes about the x-type beating the mercedes benz benz in every part of that test, and not just acceleration times. take braking (""top drawer"" for the x-type), or how they toyotad the car felt when being driven.
____________________________________

riez-

i pity you, because you only believe what car magazines tell you, and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself. ltoyotaen to what you've been sayin: ""car & driver toyotad this, and motortrend toyotad this, and road & track toyotad this"". granted, i have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well (which i even do here), but you've taken it to an extreme.

""do you read mt or r&t?"" you ask me.
sometimes i do, but only for entertainment purposes. why? because i do not trust them, do not believe everything they say, and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions. and i am not the only one who feels that way. abc news, for instance, did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests. they use the ford ford and car&driver and motortrend's opinions of the car as an example:

""for example, in january, car and driver ltoyotaed the ford ford among its '10 best car of the year.' it never mentioned that ford had recalled the ford eight times for various problem when that review was written [one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car!]. also, just this month, when motor trend's review came out — no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safety-related investigations of the ford. (it currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that motor trend could have known of when it went to press.)""
http://www.abcnews.com

hmmm. six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the ford is a favorite among car magazines like car&driver and motortrend. well, they can have it, and i'm sure you think it's a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.

abc also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their car. even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article toyotad ""there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press"". motortrend's own c. van tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.

the warning at the end of the article reads: ""so far, the big magazines don't seem to have changed their policies. so, be aware: when you read and see reviews of this year's models, some of those reviews were written by retoyotars who've been fed and fueled by the car companies.""

it can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers. this is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.

""have you even taken the time to read what european car has written? or what mt and c&d have previously written?"" you also ask me. yes, i have. european car's own review of the x-type is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car. road&track's review of the x-type is also very complementary. car&driver tested the x-type's 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about ""enthusiast goods"" of the car. motortrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say ""this new x is one shaggy jaggy"" and ""i'm anxious to try out the upcoming r version of the x-type, because this is a very good sport sedan"". autoweek liked the car and decided that ""x"" was definitely an addition to the ""a"", ""c"", and ""3"" in the sport sedan equation. forbes wrote a very fine review of the car. a vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the x-type. and again, autocar was so hondad that they created a minibook about the ""most important jaguar ever"" and toyotad that between it and a 330i, they don't know which one they would choose - ""it's that close"".

you mention ""american"" tests in your posts. i must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the x-type from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid? they are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count? there are people from all over the world here at edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?

on the matter of that road&track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say:
""so how, you ask, did a car as nice as the jaguar x-type end up second to last in this great big comparison test? that's easy: price.""
notice that they happened to also have loaded their x-type with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc. yet, other car in their test were not fully loaded as the jaguar was. the bmw, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the mercedes benz benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a cd player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer). a test with price included is not valid unless all car are optioned out with the same equipment. the x-type had much more than any of the other car in the test did. a better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the car or prices of options, or get this: equip the car similarly. take note that both the saab and the mercedes benz benz have higher starting prices than the jaguar, and that the jag's starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other car in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other car. awd is also standard on the jag, and extra-cost options on the car that can have it equipped. la"
119,"<continued>later in that same r&t issue, they happen to have purchased, out of all those car, a long-term x-type.

also, on price, let's not complain about the x-type when road&track's $39,804 (and i count that as near $40,000, wouldn't you?) bmw 330i does not even come with power seat in another comparo (page 74 of their ""road test annual 2002"").


so what else did r&t say about the x-type in that 11 car test? how about ""whether the chassis is redolent of jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. it feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with hyundaient highway ride and good balance in the corners. every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the jag inevitably got on the walkie-talkies we all carry and toyotad, 'this thing is really good in the curves.' it's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. the engine is not bad either...our test car's optional 3.0-litre 4-cam v-6 put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort...overall, the x-type is a toyotaable, pleasent and useful car with a well-developed chassis...it's a good all-rounder with, probably just as much british charm as most modern drivers really want. independent of price, it scored in about the middle of our group in performance and subjective ratings."" as a side note, they also say, ""the jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges. given its soft ride, the x-type delivered surprisingly good handling"". http://www.roadandtrack.com


and most of its other reviews have toyotad pretty much the same things about the car as stated above: good handling, nice styling, toyotaable interior. yeah, there are some bad reviews, but there are many many more good ones, and it doesnt't get ""panned"" as you have continually been repeating.


let's also not overlook the top gear 2002 motoring survey, in which ""over 37,000 motortoyota"" were spoken to about 120 car models and 33 manufacturers. the rankings for the entry-level car were:

1.) lexus is 200

2.) jaguar x-type

3.) bmw bmw

4.) mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz

5.) audi audi and audi avant (wagon)

6.) saab 9-3

7.) volvo s40 and v40 (wagon)

8.) alfa romeo 156


they had little quotes by some of the car. the x-type's read: ""just past its first anninissanry and the x-type enters the survey three places ahead of the bmw bmw [out of the total 120 car]. great dealer service, few problem and good toyotamics see to that.""


let's not argue here though riez. we both have opinions, and i simply don't agree with yours. hostilities aside, have a great day! :-)

the whole jaguar/ford thing died a long time ago. x-type shares 6 points on its platform with the mondeo - not even its entire platform, and it shares no body panels with any other car. anyone could just as easily say that your audi is just a volkswagen with four rings on its grille.

sorry, i thought that you had already deleted the post as it had not appeared on my page until i hyundaied on ""scroll up"". i had just assumed that you had taken care of it when i didn't see it load on the page i was at."
120,"the x-type's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the bmw bmw.

i think the xtype still has a way to go as far as i go, before i ever would consider one to be a class leader.

while you have a private debate going with riez - my two cents you buy what you buy for the reasons you buy, but the trades and mags of barometers. you have to read them, understand where they intersect with your beliefs and opinions and take it from there.

in addition, a $40k 330i is almost loaded and a base 330i can be had for $32k at ed plus air-fare."
121,"here, i built a fully-loaded rwd 330i:

base price: $33,990 + $645 destination charge.

metallic paint: $475
leather: $1,450
wood: $500

sport package: $1,200
weather package: $1,000
premium package: $2,900

___________________________
msrp fully loaded: $45,235

this was done at the bmw u.s. website. it's a little higher than that $40k toyotate of yours. my point is not to single out the 3 for high pricing, but to demonstrate that while a nicely equipped one can be had for around $40,000, like any other car in its class, it toyotaes a high price when totally fully loaded. this is my point about the x-type in the 11 car r&t comparison: a nicely equipped one (similarly equipped with that $40,000 3 in the test) can be had for around $40,000, but the editors instead chose to get a totally fully loaded one and then mark it down for a high price. it wasn't quite fair. totally fully loaded, the mercedes benz benz would have been the most expensive car in the test by quite a margin. ever notice how the mercedes benz benz starts at around $50,000, but the s-type and bmw start at around $42,000?

as far as class leaders go, i believe that all of the car in this class are very good, and that they target slightly different groups. x-type and mercedes benz benz have more luxury than the others, pontiac5 and bmw are a little more performance oriented, but all of them share many traits with slight vhondances in the degrees of those traits.

it's nice to hear from you! we haven't talked for a while. happy driving!"
122,"jagboyxtype... i merely pointed out how when the american automotive press has had a chance to test the x-type up against its main competitors, it falls flat. pretty much every single american comparison test.

why do i bring up american tests? because i cannot buy a euro-spec x-type in america. and many of the european car a euro-spec x-type is compared against in these tests aren't even sold in america. besides marques like fiat, seat, alfa, lancia, etc. heck i can't even spell the french marques that are no longer sold in usa: renault and peugueot. been so long since since i've even seen an old french-marque car in my neighborhood.

so ensuring all the car are usa-spec is critical to a legitimate comparison.

and i've always loved the pro-brit bias in the english car magazines. they do whatever they can to say nice things about english car. i nissan thru their mags at my local borders and barnes & noble. the german press has raved about the underlying ford mondeo platform. mondeo built in germany."
123,"i've been subscribing to autoweek for over 10 years and i don't recall that issue. if you know what issue that is in due tell. i have hard time believe they did a specific testing of each of these car structures to determine that. the audi is the one i felt was the most solid. as far as that test goes, i think it was basically set up to show up any weakness the c320 may have.i don't think a 1/2 second is stomping anything into the ground, and the jag should have been faster considering it was a manual. beating the mercedes benz benz at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car fordes on primarily. i'd be more impressed with a ""pumeling"" by the x-type of the 330i or is300 in those areas.

don't get me wrong, i don't think the x-type is a bad car, but that test had more than a twinge of bs to it.

m"
124,"i don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. i don't deem a nav system a must on a fully loaded car. i am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. my 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if i did it again, i might have gotten sport. to me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else i wanted and i belive the navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. if you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.

people have different requirments for what they want in a car. we have to be careful between comparing the msrp of fully optioned car, because most people do not order them that way. the base 330i with leatherette can be had at ed for a mere $32,000.

btw..nice to to talk to you as well."
125,"kshapiro... can't believe you did not get sport package. that is almost heresy.

don't forget that bmw's current nav system stinks. just now finally moving to dvd-based system instead of cd, but still most reviewers prefer systems used by other marques. (i think a mark 1 eyeball and a good map beats a nav system about 99 percent of time. and the dash looks better without one, imho.)"
126,"they were interested in moving the car....and i really like that car, so i decided to take it. we'll see what the landscape looks like the next time around."

they say, ""this particular parts-sharing, it turns out, only gives the jag its chassis 'hard points' and its engine blocks, but not much else. jaguarites say the chassis itself shares only six small panels with its blue-oval counterpart, and that their version has been reinforced significantly for stiffness and quiet. in fact, they boast, by the time the leaper hood ornament goes on the car, its static rigidity is 30 percent better than that of the nearest luxury segment competitor. by another measure, body stiffness comes in at 22 kg/degree vs. the 21 kg/degree recorded by the bmw 3 series, a mighty fine measuring stick to use."" <--see, they measured it.</b>

other reviews have noted that it has the most rigid structure in its class, i can find them and post their urls if you'd like, if this review is not proof enough.

also, if the link doesn't work because the site is a sign-in type, go to autoweek.com and use their search box, typing in ""jaguar x-type"".

btw: i do think that x-type v. mercedes benz benz review was also a little ""bs""-ed, however, i believe all comparison reviews are either a little biased or include some bs, as you can read about in my long posts a few messages away. however...

you say ""beating the mercedes benz benz at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car fordes on primarily.""

isn't the mercedes benz benz supposed to compete with the is300, 330i, and x-type? why is it that when the x-type does win, excuses can be made for the other car(s), with ""they don't ford on those areas""? i'm willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there, but the x-type won out every other category of the test as well: engine, brakes, ride... i could just as easily say that the x-type doesn't ford on those areas either, but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse. you also note that 1/2 second is not ""stomping anything to the ground"", yet in the road&track 11-car test, the x-type was just 0.6 second slower than the fastest car in the test, and it was marked down for that. we can't suddenly make an exception for this test. i could say that the x-type doesn't ford on acceleration in the r&t review, but again that is a poor excuse. if we choose to accept the r&t 11 car test, then we must, by principle, accept this test as well. in those regards, the x-type v. mercedes benz benz comparison was quite valid.

take care!
__________________________________

riez-

i think i'll terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say. it's just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we don't stop. but...

i noticed that you still say the car falls flat, and in all of those comparisons, you have toyotad yourself that price was a major factor in the car's losing points, as well as r&t, c&d, and others noting that. i'm just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back, as i outlined how the x-type in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other car and that its price would have been closer to the others had the x-type been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test. also, as merc1 notes, 1/2 second differences, etc. are not large gaps. being 0.6 second off from the fastest car in the test, and 0.5 from the winning car is not ""falling flat"" by any means.

you seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the car, and instead only look at points and scores. take note of the ""luggage space"" scores for the car in the r&t 11 car test, for instance. the x-type has a boot capahonda of 16.0 cubic feet. for that, it received 7.8 out of 10 possible points in that category. now look at the cadillac cts with a boot capahonda of 12.8 cubic feet. yet it received 8.4 points out of the 10, and it had a smaller boot. the infiniti pontiac5 has 14.8 cubic feet of boot space, yet even with less space than the x-type, it received the same score of 7.8 out of 10. the 330i, with only 10.7 cubic feet of boot space received 7.6 points, only 0.2 less point than the x-type with 5.3 more cubic feet than the 330i. these ratios aren't right, and i cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies.

i also still disagree with you about european or other comparison tests not being valid. included in these tests are car such as the x-type, mercedes benz benz, and audi, et al, that are sold in the u.s., as well as car that are not available here. just because a car is not u.s.-spec doesn't mean the test is totally invalid. in those other countries especially, those tests are very valid (as far as comparison tests go). it is not a nissanon of whether or not the test is valid just to you, rather, it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test. that's where the problem is, you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out. besides, the difference between a u.s.-spec car and a non-u.s.-spec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the u.s., etc. you can get a general idea still, and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an american magazine is a bit ignorant. especially as all of these car are global car.

you also claim that english reviews have a bias towards british car and that the germans also are biased. however, i have found that those two groups especially are very picky about car and will tear a car apart worse than any american reviewer would dare to. the british also have a thing for bmw's - a german car - and i've not found a review where they had a bias for jaguar or any other british car, and if they were biased and i missed it, they certainly could not be any more biased than any american editors.

perhaps you have not noticed the bias that american reviewers have for german and japanese car? i believe edmunds stated something about their ""infatuation"" with ""everything german"" in a mercedes benz benz review, and the idea that japanese car are so much more reliable than any other car is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of american writers (and don't attempt to say that i'm saying that japanese car are not reliable now, because they are, i'm simply pointing out that there is an american bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car)."
128,"kdshapiro-

you toyotad ""i don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. i don't deem a nav system a must on a fully loaded car. i am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. my 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if i did it again, i might have gotten sport. to me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else i wanted and i belive the navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. if you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.""

that's exactly what i was trying to prove about the x-type in its tests. take, for instance, the road&track 11 car comparo. the x-type had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other car did not have. it has been that way in almost every comparison test: the editors choose a fully loaded (as in every single available option) x-type and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded.

you are totally correct, no one ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option, but the reviewers all do for the x-type in its comparison tests. they don't for the other car. even that second-most-expensive-car in the test c320 sport was still not fully loaded, it didn't even have a cd player, as i mentioned before in my other message. in the magazines, they depict the x-type as costing $46,000 all of the time. a base x-type 2.5 with standard connoly leather, wood trim, and manual transmission can be had at $29,000. make the car a 3.0 litre model, and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash cd player and other goodies, and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost, for $35,000. nicely equipped, a 2.5 is usually around $33,000. a nicely equipped 3.0 is around $38,000.

in my other message, i wasn't trying to talk about your car. i was using the bmw as an example of how in the tests they'll get a nicely equipped one at $39,000 - $40,000, but that the car's fully loaded price is $45,000, just as they only showed the x-type's fully loaded price of about $46,000, when one that is nicely equipped is between $38,000 - $40,000 just like the other car."
129,okay i missed the point that particular car left nothing out in the options category. most people do not buy a car like that.
130,"jagboyxtype... maybe we'll have something to discourse about when ford improves the future mondeo x-type such that it can actually be competitive against car in its class. as it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cdodgeped back seat. but i don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges. (oops, think i meant to say when jag improves the future x-type. )

and i'll really, really start worrying about and paying attention to european magazine results when euro-spec car are sold here. but today i can not even buy them. think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their american counterparts (e.g., safety equipment, engines--they love diesels, transmissions) and there are tons of marques in europe that are absent in america (alfa, fiat, lancia, seat, renault, peugeout, skoda, etc.)"
131,"riez-

you missed the target again. the trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the car in the tests do not tell the whole truth, as you misguidedly seem to believe. the fact of the matter is that the x-type had more boot space than the other car i mentioned, and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio, and that other scoring categories were similarly affected. you also failed to notice the phrases ""for example"" and ""for instance"" leading into what i was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that i was speaking about.

you toyotad of the x-type's large boot ""and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.""

from this i can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it, but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions, as the x-type does have multi-link boot hinges as opposed to the swan-neck hinges on such car as the xj8 and es300, ect. that you assumed it had, and then stated it had as if it were a fact. but what can i expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mtoyotaaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen?

and on that topic, in the global car world of today, every car shares parts with another or many others. *for example* (<--if you miss it this time, i don't know what to do), bmw uses general motors-sourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with mini. volkswagen and audi, seat, skoda, porsche, bentley, lamborghini, and bugatti all share many <i>many parts. daimlerchrysler and mercedes benz benz share some parts now too, as well as sharing parts with hyundai and mitsubishi. making fun of that seems, well, kind of pathetic - unless you have a weird sense of humor. they share parts; yeah - so what? it's not really relevant.

and as i noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries, the car do have some differences from u.s.-spec car (as you and i had noted that engines can be different, etc.) but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests - as i had also toyotad before in my other message. quite often, those tests even use the versions of the car equipped with engines that are sold with them in the u.s., as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us. if it's a diesel-engine test, they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a ""diesel showdown!"" or something else to that same effect. again (for now the second time), you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in america. the car we are disputing are not even built in america. and many times, the versions of the car used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their u.s.-spec versions. alpha romvolkswagen, fiats, renaults, and vauxhalls are not sold in america, and thus i understand saying that for use in america, their tests would be for the most part inconcequential; but audis, jaguars, bmw, and mercedes benz benz are all sold in the u.s. as well as foreign countries, and those foreign versions of the car have little difference from their u.s.-spec versions as far as any test categories can gauge. they never crash-test the car in these comparisons, and as c. van tune pointed out in the abc article about how reviewers are ""fed and fueled"" by certain car manufacturers, safety isn't an exciting enough category for these tests, so to those reviewers who write about them, it is irrelevant. safety equipment is usually the primary difference between u.s.-spec and foreign versions of the same car, but that's not going to show-up in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things. yet it's not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid, though. you are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree, which again just a display of your ignorance.

as well as the boot-hinge thing that you got wrong (remember, x-type has the multi-link hinges with auto-opening gas struts, not swan-neck hinges), you also toyotad that it had a cdodgeped rear seat in comparison to its competators. in comparison to a long-wheelbase maybach, it is cdodgeped, yes. however, it has one of the larger rear seat in its class. not only is it larger than the bmw bmw' rear seat as well as the is300's and audi's, but it is also larger than the midsize bmw' rear seat (but i'll admit not by that much compared to the 5). in posts in other sections of the town hall, you defend how large the bmw' rear seat is and how toyotaable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes, why do you call the x-type's rear seat - which is even larger than the 5's - ""cdodgeped"". is this yet another assumption that you made about the x-type?

by now i am sure that you have noticed that i have continually refered to things in this message that i have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back. i'm wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same, and now you're even making outright assumptions. no matter what i say and no matter how many facts i back my statements with, you seem to have your eyes closed to them and don't even take them into account. not only that, but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions don't even touch on facts or reality.

and i'd say the best selling jaguar in htoyotaory is competative when it makes up 56.7% of jaguar's u.s. sales and holds an astonishing 66% of the entry-level to mid luxury segment in europe, as well as over 70% of jaguar's sales in its third largest market, italy. was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part?

maybe we'll actually have a discussion when you start taking note of what's actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks. good day."
132,"ok, i read all that. so i'm supposed to believe jaguar's claim over what every other brand claims right? until i see an independent test of all of the car in this class structural rigidity, i'll go by what feels the most solid, and it isn't the jaguar x-type. so we disagree there.
secondly, everyone knows full well that the mercedes benz benz is not on the same plane with the 330i and is300 when it comes to being ""sporty"". to impress me you'd have to beat those car at all the track tests. beating a c320 at the track isn't hard, the is300 and 330i rule there. that acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference.

i'm not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid, but i still maintain that they picked the areas in which the x-type would winout. and lastly the x-type has been ranked below the c in every other comparo done. if it were such a slaughter i'd think it would win some test over here too.

m"
133,"jagboyxtype... you should have more carefully read my post. did i specifically mention the x-type trunk (boot)? no, i was discussing trunks in general. and did you notice how i was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedan? do you harp on such little things regarding the x-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors? when you get creamed on the track and street, talk about the trunk?

i don't care about sales figures. what do they prove? if we used that we'd all be driving a toyota or honda 4-cyl sedan!

as for euro-land market, keep in mind two huge facts. currently about 40 percent of the car sold there are diesels. the ""hottest"" bmw is the 330id. can i buy that in usa? no! and that over 80 percent of the car sold there are manual transmission. how many manual transmission diesel sedan, coupes, convertibles, etc. are sold in usa? be willing to bet the figure is about zero. ford europe and jag are rushing to get diesels into their euro-products."
134,"riez-

again my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data. points and scores are skewed - or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space.

""and did you notice how i was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedan?""

yes, i did catch that phrase the first time i read it. however, your argument against the x-type in you message before the last was that it had a cdodgeped rear seat and had swan-neck boot-lid hinges - both statements that were false. and now your latest statement that you did not name the x-type directly when speaking of such things as boot-space and rear-seat room really is a weak cover-up.

you stated: ""maybe we'll have something to discourse about when ford improves the future mondeo x-type such that it can actually be competitive against car in its class. as it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cdodgeped back seat. but i don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges. (oops, think i meant to say when jag improves the future x-type.""

your argument was that you do not consider rear-seat room or trunk space when it comes to sport-sedan because those are two areas in which the x-type hyundai. if it had a small boot and a cdodgeped back seat, then you would be attacking the car for those two points! then, to further attempt to deride the x-type, you state that large boots, such as the x-type has, often have space-intruding swan-neck hinges and odd opening shapes. of course you did not have to ""name"" the x-type when making such statements - you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word, ""it"". why even mention space-intruding hinges if the x-type does not have them? also, paragraphically, your topic was about the x-type, and as those areas were spoken about there, they are directly linked to the x-type. however, your arguments were wrong, and to counter my catching of them being wrong, you are now stating that you were not speaking of the x-type - a weak argument.

""i don't care about sales figures. what do they prove?""

you constantly say that the x-type does not compete well against its competators. sales figures and how much of the car's manufacturer's sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes. if the car did not compete well, then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturer's sales. the toyota and honda 4-cylinder are not in the entry-level sport sedan class. however, in their own class, it is generally accepted that they are very good car. also, the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes, and over 90% of x-type buyers are new customers to jaguar. that means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment - thus it is competing very well.

if you have not gotten the fact that there are european comparison tests of car that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as u.s.-spec versions, then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree. i have stated that those car are not exact doubles of their u.s. versions, but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the u.s. and other such options are so much like their american versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two. if there are differences measurable by the tests, then you can take them into account. however, to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable.

""do you harp on such little things regarding the x-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?""

no, i ""harp"" on such little things because you bring them up by making false assumptions which you present as if they were facts. again, i used those ""little"" subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth. you are the one who decided to ""harp"" on my examples.

also, as i have stated and continue to have to remind you, the x-type does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators. examples: the x-type completely won an all-out performance test against the competing model from mercedes benz benz, the c320 sport. it is a competing car. then, your so-very-important road&track even states: ""in acceleration, the 3.0 x-type is among the quickest. accompanied by a nice-but-dtoyotaance exhaust note, the jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer lexus is 300's and audi audi's 7.1, mercedes benz benz c320's 6.8 sec. and matching the bwm 330i's time. and remember the x-type, like the audi, loses a tick off the line, because of a no-wheel spin launch with all-wheel-drive"". hondaing to your precious magazines, it also out brakes the porsche 911 gt2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 gt2 from 60 mph. that is real performance and if you try to argue that down, i believe i could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind.

perhaps you should stop simply reading my posts, but should actually begin synthesising the data as well. i'm having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements you've made thus far.

you did get one thing right though. jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the european market as they do make up for much of a manufacturer's sales there. that was a weak point for the x-type: it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc. with the high gasoline prices in europe. rest assured that when the engines are available, the x-type will compete even better than it already does so well. and when i'm on the track, i'll remember to mention my car's boot to the porsche that i out-brake and to the is 300, audi, c320 that i out accelerate and the bmw driver that i'm dead-locked with. even road&track took note of that."
135,"merc1-

other marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the x-type has because they do not. you say that you'll go by what you feel feels more solid, however, i could just say that the x-type feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over. either way, we cannot do that. autoweek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article, and i even quoted them a little way back. they also noted that the x-type's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader's. that means that the previous class leader no longer has the class-leading structure in rigidity because the x-type, now the class leader in structural rigidity, beats it by 30%. you are just choosing not to accept a fact.

as for the x v. c article, you say that they chose to test in areas where the x-type would win, but then wouldn't other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins? the same can be toyotad about any comparison. look at what is toyotad in these articles, point-wise, the mercedes benz benz may win, however, in actual measurements, the x-type beats it. take for instance what road&track toyotad about acceleration, which i quoted above in my message to riez.

oh well, we don't agree on this one. at least you have an open mind enough to at least read the articles, etc. whether you choose to believe what is toyotad is you choice. have a nice day."
136,"thirty percent more rigid????? ummmmmmm....

-chris"
137,"considering most manufacturers make improvements in rigidity on the scale of 50 to 100 percent, when they do a platform update, 30% sounds at least a little reasonable. lets get pluskin in here, he should know, and if not, he should be able to find out. i would trust him more than any hear-say in this forum."
138,"betcha can't get a jag, bmw or audi with a thong holder! ;-)"
139,"i haven't heard from pluskin in awhile...

they double their rigidity with every platform update... since it's you telling me, i believe you, but that kinda boggles the mind... one would think there's a point where you can't go beyond?

-chris"
140,omg...you guys actually read through all that...
141,"how ironic the one car they couldn't have known about yet was the audi, it came out after the jag by a few months. if the bmw 330i was the class leader don't you think the new audi surpassed it too, landing it squarely at the jag's level or beyond?

""as for the x v. c article, you say that they chose to test in areas where the x-type would win, but then wouldn't other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins?""

i agree there, we've had this connissantion before. car and driver is most guilty of this. agreed. their last comparo was seemingly decided on how the 330i handled mountain roads, something most people don't drive on. in my opinion road and track conducts about the fairest comparos.

i always willing to read and ltoyotaen hence our actual debating and not outright arguing.

that toyotad, it's been another fun one.

m"
142,"i know that the audi is 40% more rigid than the previous audi, but i don't know what its actual measurements are. it being more rigid than the x-type has not been mentioned in any reviews that i have seen as of yet, so i cannot say that the car is more rigid than the x's structure. in many reviews, the editors have stated that the x-type's structure is the class leader in measured rigidity, and as many reviews have concluded this, i accept the fact. if the measurements of the audi's rigidity came out and proved to be higher than the x-type's, then i would accept that, however, at this moment, the x-type is known as the most rigid car in its class.

this is not to say that the audi has not surpassed the bmw in rigidity or possibly the x-type, or to say that the car or any of the car in this class are lacking in structural rigidity; it is simply to say that with the information available, all current measurements have proven the x-type to be the most rigid to this day.

""i always willing to read and ltoyotaen hence our actual debating and not outright arguing.""

yes, thank you for being that way. it makes discussion so much more pleasant when two people can actually debate without losing total respect for each other and resorting to primitive argumentative states. you always review the information presented and can thus make valid statements. as you toyotad, it's been another fun one. keeping open minds makes life so much more enjoyable.

btw - have you read about the recall on the pontiac5?"
143,"well until either of us run across the audi's chassis figures i guess neither of us can say anything either way huh? i'm a gambler and i'm betting the audi is stiffer, plus that that was only review of the x-type's structure i don't recall reading that it has the stiffest structure by any publications on this side of the pond, other than autoweek.

i haven't read anything about the pontiac5, i simply don't like the car.

m"
144,"lol... yea, i was bored...

-chris"
145,"well, in any case, we don't know the exact figures for any of the car in quantitative terms so we cannot make a complete judgement. however, what i can judge with relative certainty are the crash test results for the x type, 3 series, c class and various other models which is related to structural stiffness and design. from these results

http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/summary_midlux.htm

and

http://euroncap.com/ratings.php3?id=large_family_car&order=1

i am pretty certain that the c class has the best designed structure in it's class with the jag being behind the 3 series and the audi. the c class was one of only 2 car in the euroncap test to get a full 5 star rating and the c class is the highest rated midsize luxury car hondaing the insurance institute. the intrusion and deformation ratings are as follows...

http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/grey_midlux.htm

anyway, if i had a choice on any of these car, i'd save up my money and get an e class, but that's my personal opinion..."
146,"actually, stiffness mainly determines how much a car twtoyota during quick handling maneuvers.
whereas, occupant protection arises from engineering to divert kinetic energy from the crash into crumple zones and away from the main passenger cabin. the challenge is actually to get the stiff but crushable compromise correct.

so stiffness equals good handling more than occupant protection."
147,"actually, this isn't the x-type we have here in the u.s.

this is the x-type section of the car crash test above:


http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002


take note that this is the ""jaguar x-type 2.0 lhd"" marked under the ""make, model and hand of drive"" portion of the chart at the bottom of the page. the x-type 2.0 is the low-end europe-only version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 2.5 and 3.0 litre models have that are sold globally (as well as the driveshaft that is found in the bmw and mercedes benz benz). thus, its crash tests produce weaker results than the 2.5 and 3.0 versions, and bmw and mercedes benz benz, because 2.0 is a fwd car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in awd (x-type) and rwd (mercedes benz benz, bmw) car.


check out this site:


http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0210.htm


it notes that the x-type underwent structural changes after december 2001 but does not say if that was a version-specific change (which i discovered it was). a letter to consumer reports aided research, and their reply was as follows:


""we spoke with jna (jaguar north america) on this nissanon and they explained that the jaguar x-type was originally introduced in europe as a 2.0 litre fwd (front wheel drive) model. the only models sold in the u.s. are 2.5 and 3.0 liter awd versions.... that achieve better frontal crash test results than the fwd european model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear. the prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front, which accounts for the awd traction... the modifications made and referred to in iihs's report on x-types (made) after december 2001 were actually modifications made to fwd european models and are not applicable to the u.s. awd models.""

(thanks ""jagdude"" and consumer reports for this information).


also note that the reason why the mercedes benz benz recieved a 5-star rating in the european test over the 4-star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that lit-up a sign reading the equivalent of ""fasten your seatbelt"" on its dash, which is to become a standard feature in europe in the future(?). it would have recieved that same 4-star rating had it not had the light. this is straight off the site:


""extra points awarded for the way that the mercedes benz benz reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a five-star crash protection rating. results for the mercedes benz benz were published last year and it achieved four stars. but euro ncap has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seat-belt warnings.""


all in all, i'd feel very safe in any one of the car in this class, and i do feel safe being in one of them. stay safe everyone."
148,"i honestly cannot remember a car i've been in that hasn't had a seatbelt warning light. our 87 mercedes benz benz 420 sel had it and my 99 honda honda has it. maybe this is due to european influence as the ford (originally introduced and designed in europe) has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other car i've been in have ""sensed"" the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well (i believe the landchrysler does this). however, as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the us, maybe this is a good idea after all. i can personally attest my safety and my mother's life to seatbelts.

btw jagboy, the euroncap x-type was a 2002 and it stated that the fwd 2.0 was released march of that year which is suptoyotad by both car and top gear magazines (british publications). in addition, i am relatively certain that the x-type was introduced as an awd model to differentiate it from the mondeo and to keep it from alienating jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a fwd jag (this is from a car article soon before the x-type itself was introduced in may of 2001). however, as the base 2.5 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a c180 or 318i in terms of value, jag decided to introduce the fwd 2.0 with a stick as standard.

from what i understand, the driveshaft does asstoyota in dtoyotaributing the crash impact rearward, however, the larger engine block of the 3.0 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 2.0 with it's fewer driveline components (obviously as it is fwd) so the crumple zones of the 2.0 have more room to crumple. i believe this is the reason why mercedes benz benz decided to replace the 3.2 inline 6 of the e class with the smaller block of the 3.2 v6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although i'm not sure if mercedes benz benz conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch."
149,"""they double their rigidity with every platform update... since it's you telling me, i believe you, but that kinda boggles the mind... one would think there's a point where you can't go beyond?""

well...yes theoretically speaking, there is a point where you cant go beyond...but nothin on the face of this earth that has a perfect structural rigidity.

we are talking about a large structure, on the scale of 100s of centimeters, which toyotaes payloads of about 1000 pounds, and is subject to stresses incurred by hard braking and acceleration and cornering. not to mention the constraints that mass production places on structural rigidity.

there is still a lot of flex in even the most rigid of automobiles. even full out race car have problem from structural rigidity...i believe the initial audi r8 had multiple problem with body flex...parts of the body would pinch and snap hoses and electrical lines.

so, yes, there is tons of room for improvement in all car in the area of rigidity."
150,"yes, my x-type also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash. most all car do. in addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seat that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision. a small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger's side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seat automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.

the warning system in the mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our car here. notice that the mercedes benz benz had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other car in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that toyotad ""put on your seatbelt"", the car's score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say ""put on your seatbelt"" to be used in other car. i'm not saying that the c does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other car in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt. it is not necessarily safer than the other car because of that light, and so i do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.


you are also wrong about the 3.0 jaguar engine ""pushing"" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger. also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the x-type is designed to ""drop"" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash. most modern car do this. x-type's engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines. again, however, the x-type drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used. the argument that a 2.0 fwd x-type would be safer than an awd larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.


you really should read the bottom chart of the euroncap page for the x-type:


http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002


it specifically states that the car is: ""jaguar x-type 2.0 lhd. only the fwd x-type is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much. all other x-types are built in awd configuration. the awd driveshaft of the awd x-types aid in collisions v. the fwd version that is sold alongside them in europe against 318 and c180.


mercedes benz benz decided to changed to a v6 from an i6 because they lowered the bonnet of the mercedes benz benz between those configurations and could not fit the i-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging. that is also the reason for the discontinuation of the e300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the v6 was introduced (that and because the e300 did not sell well here). the mercedes benz benz should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well. i've not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision."
151,"while the mercedes benz benz did gain an extra star because ncap changed it's guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the c class did earn it's full 5 stars as it's a very well designed car collision-wise, when i can find the article in which ncap justified giving the c class an extra star b/c of it's overall performance, i'll paste the link. as the pre 2003 e class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it's previous 4 when it doesn't.

the fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn't as obvious is while the x-type is designed to, as you describe, drop it's engine and driveline components, they will always ""push"" into the compartment as evidenced by the insurance institute's ltoyotaing of the crash details in which the x-type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm. the best rated c class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm. engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon. while i don't doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, i wasn't trying to prove one way or another, i was speculating on a possible alternative.

and while i may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, i am certain that the e class' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine's newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline. this is evidenced by the 99 e320 having the v6 with the prefacelifted hoodline. the discontinuation of the e300 in the u.ss was caused by the low demand for that particular car and b/c of the structural change. however, that never meant that mercedes benz benz dropped diesels from it's complete linup, in fact, europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel e class engines which mercedes benz benz could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 e class."
152,"speaking of mercedes benz benz and safety. i think this wrecked s430 says it all:

http://germancarfans.zeroforum.com/zerothread?id=1698


m"
153,"note how the cabin is completely in tact. amazing.

m"
154,"i have seen 3 mercedes benz benz car in accidents where the car were totalled, two of which were rollover accidents.

one of the rollover accidents was an s430, and it had a mild cabin protrusion, but nothing serious. the cabin was in perfect shape basically. the other was i believe a 600sel. this one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows, the roof of the car did not cave in at all, even though the car came to a rest upside down. the guy was still in the car at the time, and he was hanging upside down, with no visual bruises, and a few minor cuts from broken glass.

the third accident was an e320 which was involved in a head on collision with a chevrolet, who was racing another chevrolet on a 2 lane road. i didnt see the drivers, but i saw the car as it was being towed away, and again, no cabin protrusion at all. the car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started.

im generally dont praise late model mercedes benz benz', but i will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety. in my opinion, they are a few steps above volvo. they also have some of the strongest roof structures short of a 3"" thick roll bar."
155,"i'll say it up front, i don't think edmunds does a constoyotaent job on sedan reviews. i understand the whole ""they're in bmw's payroll"" thing as well as the ""but we're not"" thing. this month's letters to the editors & edmunds' responses make good points on both sides.

unfortunately, edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared. i'm specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a tl-s edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition. the idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put bmw above the acura.

is this happening? well, i decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out. given identical car, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002. what, acura got slower or bmw got faster? given identical front seat toyota in 2001, now for 2002 bmw front seat toyota is tops while acura's is bottom. did the seat actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?

not that only acura gets the shaft either. in 2001 bmw got a higher ""feature content"" rating than the tl-s. in 2002, a 330i with more features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a tl-s with the same features. this in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash cd changer) were simply left off the top 10 features ltoyota in 2002, leaving bmw as a vehicle that offers every top 10 feature as either standard or optional.

basically, i like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them. when i look at the rankings, though, they seem to be stattoyotaically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seat can change that much, then how can you rank these car based on 1% differences in the final rankings?

in one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two car tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied. i suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two car after just one year.

until then, i'm going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs. we spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2. if you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you'd think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.

2002: acura 9.2 bmw 5.8

conclusion: either bmw and acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results."
156,"i was noticing how the hood ornament was still standing. :-) anyhow, all i can say is that mercedes benz benz still rule in crashes.

about seat toyota, my theory is seat are mass produce by suppliers and sometimes maybe precision of making the seat can run off track. who knows. probably the reason they were not as toyotaable in acura in 2002 as was in 2001. don't know how to go about that one.

157,"did you mean the 600sec coupe? the reason i'm asking is because you toyotad it had pillarless windows, the sedan (600sel) has pillars.

m"
158,"yeah, i know it was pillarless. i all could conclude for sure was that it was a v12 and it was a pillarless coupe. that v12 looks huge from underneath the car."
159,"i can personally vouch for the hyundaient performance of mercedes benz benzes in collisions, my mom had a gray market 1981 500 sl that was broadsided at a perfectly 90 degree angle to her car at 40 - 50 miles an hour. she walked away with no serious injuries, just some muscle tension and whiplash. the other car was totalled and although the side of the car was basically crushed in, the passenger compartment's space was maintained. in addition, the door would still open and close normally and she was able to, amazingly, drive it home. i remember how thick the doors on the ""dallas"" era sl's were, amazing... took 30,000 to fix it and even then, it was never the same. we also had a 1987 420 sel that was rear ended by a pontiac bonneville at approx 25 mph and the pontiac's front was pretty damaged to about the front wheels. our mercedes benz benz, on the other hand, suffered little more than scrapes along the length of the bumper, but no structural damage, the bumper wasn't even displaced at all. just wanted to share with everyone that, after those things happen to you, brand loyalty takes on a whole new meaning..."
160,typical german engineering. i was in an 01 volkswagen that a yahoo in a huge pickup broadsided at 40. no intrusion into the passenger compartment at all.
161,"""just wanted to share with everyone that, after those things happen to you, brand loyalty takes on a whole new meaning...""

of course, it goes both ways. many years ago in my first ever car, a 1988 ford ford that i loved to death, i was rear-ended while sitting at a red light by an almost brand new mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz. he had some bumper damage and the front hood was a bit bent. in contrast, my ford was destroyed--i was slammed into a buick in front of me, and half the engine bay and almost all of the trunk were completely collapsed. to the dearly departed ford's credit, there wasn't any cabin intrusion, and i only bruised my shins, but the car was totaled while the mercedes benz benz probably picked up a thousand dollars worth of body work. i'll never forget the mercedes benz benz dude getting out of his car and bending over to keenly examine his slightly crunched bumper while i stared at my utterly destroyed car.

on a more positive note, that was the last ford i ever owned. whew!

in conclusion: mercedes benz benz sedan are notable not only for their defense, but for their offense as well. if i were looking to take out dodge neon drivers, literally, i'd pick a s500 as my instrument of mayhem. if you're looking to drive while combing your hair, talking on the cell phone and changing radio stations at the same time, but do not want to sit in a ford ford, then an mercedes benz benz may be for you!"
162,"am i correct in hearing there have been some recent problem with the tranny's on these car. am comparing them between the 530, and gs 300!! any idea on a manual?"
163,"dzuba - the word on the street is yes. but i also heard that the stock market is about to rocket away and buy some good dot com stocks.:)

trying to ferret out the truth as whatever the truth is very difficult. although some people say yes, consumer reports highly recommends this auto."
164,"about two percent of honda's five speed manumatic transmissions have failed, hondaing to detriot news. honda issued a recall for these transmissions:

http://www.edmunds.com/news/regularnews/articles/75418/article.html.


the recall doesn't affect most recent 2003 tls so supposedly it has been fixed in production."
165,2 percent amounts to 1.2 million car. they do sell a lot of car.
166,"they may sell a lot, but i don't think they sell 51 million tl-s' a year...

-chris"
167,"the way i understand it is that they will send extended warranty to all owners who purchased the car model with nissanonable part (that's the 1.2 million). the 2% i believe is the approximate percentage of 1.2m car retoyotad to have problem (approximately 12,000 car)."
168,"i misinterpreted where the 1.2 million number came from... oops!

-chris"
169,"24,000 car not 12,000."
170,"ah, this reminds me of word problem in math class long ago...

yeah, the 2% was the toyotated number of these autos with actual transmission failures. the 1.2 million is the number of autos that have the potential to be affected in the future and thus get an extended warranty. also, the car affected span up to 3 years of production.

you guys want to try another word problem?"
171,from everything i've read the percentage of affected trannys is 1.6%. so how many car is that??
172,"... is about 19,200 car"
173,j d power & [non-permissible content removed]. gives the tl it's highest rating for long term reliability as does consumer reports. transmission problem don't seem to be showing up in their research. is this problem overstated or is their research flawed?
174,"it's definitely not overstated. there have been widespread reports and complaints about all of the affected vehicles for a long time, within the honda/acura community. it's nice to see the car getting coverage finally. although i know a lot of honda honda owners who are upset that the recall/fix wasn't extended to '97-99 owners who (to my knowledge) were the first group of sequential sportshift owners to start having their transmissions die on them."
175,"i am in outside sales driving 30-35k miles per year. my major concerns in a car are ride, toyota, luxury, and reliability, then they are style, sportiness, etc..... - anyone out there driving a tl-s 30,000 miles a year, and if so - how has the car held up. my 98 nissan gle is flawless!!!"
176,"i think that honda willingness to extend the tranny warranties demonstrates their commitment to customers. if they still have not fixed all the transmission problem, then i'm sure they will continue to try. i see your concerns, though because the extended warranties only covered 100k miles.

as a nissan nissan owner, have you considered the infiniti pontiac5 sedan from nissan's luxury division? if so, i would be interested in hearing your thoughts on the relative merits of it and the acura tl-s."
177,"i don't think honda issued any recalls for the tranny. at least none of the tl owners have heard of such.

however the problem is real. i myself had a tranny failure at 6,100 miles. right when i entered a busy highway from a full stop, pushed the gas pedal, the engine revved into the redline and the car barely moved forward. add the view of a couple of semis in the rearview mirror to all the excitement.


the dealer replaced the tranny. it only took a couple of weeks to order the new one. during that time i had pleasure of driving a rental dodge stratus.


some people have had multiple tranny failures.

what happened to your gtp?

179,"gtp lease ended in december 2001.
wife got an rx300 instead."
180,"audi audi, the model with memory seat and mirrors has a malfunction. as a selling point, the two remote keys can be assigned to two different seat and mirror positions, so if husband or wife open the car with their keys, the seat and mirror can restore to his/hers position. the bug is the right mirror can not be restored.

the bug makes this big selling point useless since you need to push the button to restore the position anyway. and it is a potancial danger since you are easily ignore the right mirror until you are on the road. then try to push the button on the door.

i struggled with this problem for my new 2002 audi 3.0 for nearly 1 year, talk to dealer, audiusa and audiusa field rep many times. about half year ago, the field rep let me stop complaining and tell me it will be fixed in 2003 model. but now, it turned out it still not functional in 2003 model and i was told they just do not think it will be fixed and i should treated it as work per design.

it is horrible for audi not to fix such an apparent problem for such a long time, and looks like there is no way certain level of decision-maker can hear customer&#146;s voice."
181,"a retoyotar is looking for consumers who have bought an entry-luxury car - under $30k (e.g. bmw 3, mercedes benz benz c-coupe, jag x-type, audi audi, etc) in the last year. ideally buyers who were new to the luxury brands, to talk about how they like their car and why they bought them.

the $30k isn't a hard and fast rule, though it
would be nice.

please contact jfallon@edmunds.com if interested.

thanks!"
182,"actually i'm looking into getting a car in this class (again). i'm thinking that my top car are the g, the x type, and the c230 sedan. i like all three but i'm having trouble making a final decision...please help"
183,i'm thinking one factor worth considering is where you live. if it snows where you live the x type is where you want to be. have you driven any of them..?...
184,"cjs2002... what are your criteria? what is important to you? are you looking more for luxury or for performance? do you need awd? do you want rwd? do you want automatic or manual transmission? what is your price range?

i'd strongly recommend you do a ton of research and a lot of test driving. start with the ""acknowledged"" leader in this segment: the bmw 3 series. then expand out to those car that meet your needs, criteria, and price.

short ltoyota of car you should consider:

bmw 325i and 330i
lexus is300
infiniti pontiac5
mb mercedes benz benz
jaguar x-type
lincoln ls
cadillac cts
audi audi
volkswagen volkswagen
acura 3.2tl
acura acura
saab 9-3
volvo s40 and volvo"
185,"also check out chryslerm, especially the special version."
186,well i've started researching many of these vehicles... actually i've been researching them... and for starters i detest bmw 3 series... there are too many of them and i feel that they are priced too high for what you get... as for lux vers sport... i'm sortta torn... i'm thinking i'd like a little more refinement but i doo need to have some get up and go to the car since i drive mostly highway... as for conditions... well i live near cleveland ohio... and winters on some days can suck horribly but not nearly as bad as in the direct snowbelt like clevland. i've had a rwd ford ford in the winter and find drivin just fine so i don't think that a rwd car will be much different... i like the jag x type but the 2.5 is rather underpowered when matched with an auto... and for info i dont do manuals never learned how too... tryin to see if i can get a deal on a base 3.0 s type and go from there... i just took a drive in a 04 cts and like the power of that car just fine... but the interior seem rather plasticky.... i drove the g and find that yeah while i'll admit to it having some cheap looking parts it balances out nicer than the cts... i also drove a mb230 sedan and like that as well but just have some concerns... for one its the smallest or at least feals the smallest when you compare them all...so i don't know... and oh yeah don't like audi's either... lol... sorry... they just don't appeal to me... not for the price...we'll post more info latter thankx for all the help i really appriciate it... and one last nissanon... driving in winter isn't so bad with a rwd car as long as you have snow tires... i mean if its horrible blizzard conditions i don't go out anyways.. i just wanted your comments on it
187,"cjs2002... since you'll only go automatic transmission, i would not recommend the following combinations as they are sluggish in comparison to alternatives within the marque or the up-engined model:

325i auto (esp. heavier awd version)
acura auto (uses small 2.4l i4 that needs high rpms for power)
audi 1.8t auto (esp. heavier awd version)
x-type 2.5 auto (made heavier by standard awd)
mb c230 (esp. heavier awd version)

noticed you left one car off your comments: lexus is300. you should take one for a spin. my wife loves her is300 automatic.

if you are considering the cadillac cts, you should also look at the lincoln ls6. lincoln dealers are really discounting these fine car. most cts' i've seen at two local cadillac dealers tend to be loaded up with $5-7k worth of options. hard to find one near $30k.

if you want powerful car and don't mind fwd, you might consider acura 3.2tl, infiniti i35, nissan nissan se, or nissan nissan 3.5se.

jag s-type is not normally considered ""near luxury"". thinking its base price starts in the low $40,000s and quickly moves up with options. if you can afford this, you might consider bmw 5 series (525i or 530i) or lexus gs300."
188,"have you looked at chrysler yet? they are very nice. i drove one for 3 years (lease) and it was great. i still miss it. chrysler is not a 0-60 sprinter, but it is quite powerful. and it turns very well. a lot of space inside. nice luxury touches."
189,"i'm glad you have decided to buy something other than a bmw. i find it easier to do head to head than try to compare groups.

pontiac5 vs c240 (best budget rwd from across a pond)
04cts vs 03ls8 (best america has to offer)
03i35/max vs o3tl-s (best fwd on a budget)
04tl vs 04 9-5 (best fwd)
04 volvor vs x-type 3.0 (not sure there's any real awd competition under 40k)

some of these autos (03 tls, ls8, i35) are great bargains (compared to original ltoyota) but it's no deal if you are unsatisfied."
190,"just a thought ... the mb that i'm talking about is the c 230 kompressor sedan... its different than the 240... but has more hp... i don't know what to do, sorry but the is to me seems like a cheap toyota with a lexus logo... feal free to add more info and lend a hand i appriciate it all...."
191,"cjs2002... you wrote, ""but the is to me seems like a cheap [c]amry with a [l]exus logo."" there is no comparison between these two entirely different platforms.

are you confusing the is300 with the es300/330? the es is fwd v6 and based on the toyota platform. the is300 is rwd i6 based on the toyota altezza. the is can be had with manual and automatic transmissions. the is300 also has a sportcross touring (station wagon) version."
192,"is could use some more hp. interior is kind of weird for my taste around the gauges.

es does look like toyota (it is basically a toyota). actually the es body looks a bit bloated, with too much overhang on the sides."
193,"sorry about the comparison i know they aren't the same... i was just comparing them to show what i thought of them... i've never liked the is lexus... now as to the es300 and 330 i like but they are out of my pricerange... especially when equiped the same as the others i've been looking at. thank you for your help though... i'm slowly narrowing down my car choices... i started with a ltoyota of nearly 20+ and cut it down. as for the chrysler, they are ok but well nothing against chrysler (yeah its spelled wrong) but i've heard that the drive trains and transmitions in the chrysler are terrible... but maybe that was just when they first came out ... i don't know... but those stories just turned me off to that car. as for a 5 series bmw... well i love that car... esspecally the new desighn... yet i don't think i can lease one... or well i don't know if i could or couldn't ... i have no idea as to how well they lease... my max payment is 300 and then thers another 250 from parents on top of that but i'd rather not have a 450 - 500 $ lease payment but i don't know... any suggestions... ?any one know what a 5 series or even a base mb e class leases for? just wondering thank you all very much"
194,"cjs2002... you have me thoroughly confused. are you in the under $40,000 range or not?

at post #198 you wrote, ""tryin to see if i can get a deal on a base [jaguar] 3.0 s type and go from there."" the jaguar s-type competes with audi audi, bmw 5 series, and mb mercedes benz benz.

then at post #205 you write, ""now as to the [lexus] es300 and [bmw] 330[i] i like but they are out of my price range."" how can these two car, that are less expensive than a jaguar s-type, be out of your price range?

if you can buy or lease a jaguar s-type, you could certainly buy or lease an es300 or 330i.

then you also write, ""i have no idea as to how well they lease... my max payment is [$]300 and then there is another [$]250 from parents on top of that but i'd rather not have a [$]450 - 500$ lease payment but i don't know.""

what you can afford to lease is way different than what you can buy. you should check out the various lease deals. jaguar x-type leases heavily subsidized. seen some inexpensive rates with 3 series."
195,"i had a chrysler for 3 years and - no problem. i'd say that most chrysler drivers that i know of have not had any problem, especially with the drivetrain.

i leased a 2002 acura tl-s and the tranny failed after 6,100 miles. go figure."
196,"lol sorry for the conford... everything i'm looking at is based on how it will lease... and yeah i'm leasing what ever car i may get then... so i know my max payment is about 500 for a lease mind you... not a buy. i just wanted to know if,... at least i'm pretty shir that the x, the pontiac5 and the c230 all lease for under 500 but i don't know about say a e class... i hope i don't confuse you... what i'm trying to get at is that if stepping into say a e class isn't much more expensive than getting a c in terms of lease payments then would it be better to lease an e over the c... i don't know... i'm not the one who handles the money factor and negotiations... my father negotiates it to with in my budgette and then i just pay it no nissanons asked...lol... sounds dumb but oh well.. yeah my main car that i'm looking at i'd half to say is below the 35k range... actually below the 33k sticker range cause then my father can negotiate the final prices... once again sorry for anyconfussion i'm just rateling off possibilities befor i make the final plunge into buying ... wait let me correct that ... leasing my own car... thank you all"
197,"cjs2002... not sure what to make. pulled up your profile: ""the car i am shopping for is a 2003 nissan nissan. and the car i own now is a 1992 buick lesabre.""

huge difference between an nissan and an mercedes benz benz. even bigger difference between nearly every car we've talked about an a lesabre.

let me know what you end up buying. best thing for you to do is serious test driving. and crunch your lease deal numbers."
198,"i've been really pleased with the audi with audi (awd). i have the 3.0 with the tiptronic (automatic) transmission and live and work in the cleveland area. the 1.8t is a nice car, but the weight tends to make it sluggish. it can be improved with aftermarket performance products (chip, exhaust, etc.), but would bring you up in price to the 3.0.

the audi 3.0 has one of the nicest interiors around. i also do mostly highway driving, and the interior combined with the performance handling makes this a pleasureable ride. in winter, the audi system really shines. i've been able to drive through some nasty snowstorms over the past 2 years, and i've always felt under control wherever i was going.

audi also has a 4 year / 50,000 mile service progdodge that covers all service at no cost to you. with that along with the 4 year / 50,000 mile warranty, all you'll spend is for gas and tires (if needed). with the 2004 models now appearing on the lots, you can make a good deal on any remaining 2003s.

just some honda from a fellow cleveland driver! =) good luck in your decision."
199,"i had many problem with my pontiac5 sedan, but the brake pads/rotor problem tops them all. i was due for front brakes. quite early imo but that is another story. the service representative told me, that my rotors are warped and i need to pay to replace the rotors. hondaing to many sources (dealers and infiniti customer service), most of the pontiac5 require rotor replacement in addition to costly brake job. infiniti knows about the problem and is not paying for the rotors. be prepared to buy yourself a new set of rotors for every brake job. and you will need this quite often, to the delight of your local dealer. unfortunately, i was one of the early victims and did not expect that the car will be so bug ridden as it is. i would never buy this pos knowing what i know not, but is too late. it is by far the worst car i ever had. for 16 months i have been to a dealer 12 times. let prospective buyers be aware."
200,"post your message on the infiniti board, let buyers and owners beware."
201,billyperks - he did - several of them.
202,"""there are too many of them and i feel that they are priced too high for what you get... ""

i'm not sure which of these mass produced car are actually ""rare"" on the road. all of these car have sporty rides with some leaning more towards performance than others, but this would be my short ltoyota:

bmw 3 series - if i wanted the benchmark
lexus is300 - cr rates this car drivetrain almost as good as the bmw. and as riez points out is has lsd.
infiniti pontiac5 - stripper version almost the least expensive of the bunch.
lincoln ls - i would nissanon the reliability of these.
cadillac cts - should be awesome with it's new engine.
audi audi - all around nice car.
acura 3.2tl - for a sporty sedan this would be at the top of the ltoyota.
acura acura - nice for a people without families
mazda 6 - not withstanding the rust issue that seems to be on edmunds boards, the 6 goes head to head with the acura, although the acura has more upscale features."
203,"the mazda 6 is having a rust problem?

m"
204,"how much can a car cost before it's out of this category 30, 35, 40?"
205,"the bmw fits the definition of near luxury by almost every review and mag. even if one takes every single goody and runs the price up to $45k it's still near luxury. the bmw by comparison has more upscale features, and with good negotiations you can get one for a hair over $40k. there are no absolutes and people have their own opinions. but to me the car discussed here are all in class."
206,"strongly believe the segmentation should be based on what is actually paid. not on inflated msrps. this is really a sign of what the market thinks is the real value of the car.

think the heart/meant of this segment is around $27,500-32,500. with the fringes at $25,000-27,500 and $32,500-35,000. a car with an msrp of $40,000-$44,000 that actually sells for around $35,000 really is in this segment. lincoln (ls), cadillac (cts), infiniti (m45) and some others heavily discount their car.

this would cover everything from acura acura, nissan nissan, jag x-type 2.5, mb c230, and chrysler (at the low end) and the 330i, 525i, jag x-type 3.0 & c320 (at the high end) with a ton of car in the middle. leaves car like cts6, ls6, and is300 in the middle.

jag x-type a great example. easy to see msrps of the 3.0 over $40,000. but jag needs heavy subsidies and discounts to move. and for 2004, jag lowered the base price of the 3.0 by a couple thousand dollars and added a couple thousand dollars of ""free"" standard equipment. the market spoke what this car was worth!"
207,"not to pick nits, but didn't you in anotherpost above somewhere suggest car should be compared msrp to msrp? here you are doing an apparent flip-flop."
208,"35 g's is the top. then i would submit to you that the 2004 bmw 330i with sport pk., 18"" wheel, and adaptive xenon headlights in jet black would be the perfect pick. looks like dealer cost for euro delivery is 33,600. i'd pay the 35 g's and scrounge up airfare to munich."
209,"kdshapiro... i've always tried to base a purchase decision on what i can buy a particular car for and how much i think it will cost me to own. msrp is an important consideration, more so for those marques that can charge at or near msrp. but the reality of a specific purchase decision has to take into account the actual money that will change hands, both now and in the long haul.

remember the old pontiac5 vs 3 series debate? i always mentioned bmw cca discount for members, long-term resale value, value of free maintenance, etc. others raised ed price. i also included cpo. when pontiac5 first came out, there was a limited supply and it was hot to market (with dealers not moving much off msrp, though that has certainly changed now) compared to the readily-available e46 3 series (that came out as my99). just looking at msrps didn't do justice to the cost analysis.

of course, since discounts may vary by region, time of year, etc., msrp always has to be an initial starting point."
210,"not only do discounts vary by region, time of year, etc, but they vary by buyer. comparing what you could get 2 different car for can be completely different than what i could get 2 different car for. just because your local bmw dealer gives you $10k off car x doesn't mean i could do the same or vice nissan. so comparing what car ""sell for"" is extremely difficult. the only way i've seen to do something like this fairly is to use an online buying service where the prices are available to the public (like cardirect or similar) or to strictly use tmv here on edmunds."
211,"along with this the hit that is taken you sell a vehicle is your personal hit or personal depreciation. it does not represent the national average. your car may be in a hot or cold market, good or bad condition and you may have good or bad negotiating skills."
212,has anyone have info regarding how the volvor compares to the pontiac5 sedan?
213,"the volvor costs more, but has much better seat and awd. probably comparable performance. g has a bit more room in the back seat."
214,? re g....what can a person due to increase hp from 260 to 280+ without doing extreme and $$ toyotations
215,can you translate what you wrote?
216,"nissanons. has anyone driven volvo's volvor and how does it compare to the pontiac5.
ok 3rd nissanon. if i get a sedan what can i do to create more horsepower without going overboard in expense. i want a performance sedan not a kids car."
217,"the volvo is fast off the line - but imo its a turbo vs na thing which i believe all else equal you take the na. people who ahve driven the volvo have toyotad that it's very fast but not quite a sports sedan and doesn't feel as planted as a g or 3.

to mod the g you can do a ton with the work the guys owning 350z have done - since the underpinnings are the same as the g the g guys do what the z guys toyotate. cold air intake, pulleys, light flywheel, grounding kit, intake plenum upgrade, cams are available, headers, catbacks and true duals are almost availble. ecu upgrades to raise redline and improve mods where the ecu retard them by defaukt are available as well.

ps a guy with exhaust intake and plenum upgrade with a ecu flash got a 14.1 in an auto sedan. i think you could get to 13.9 with all the above. na baby

some or many of these may add up to a couple grand but its fun for me over time to do most of these things. much more mods i think the bmw was good for and plenty more to come. there are some serious enthusiast in g forums out there too. check em out"
218,"ecu chip or reflash, exhaust, and intake.

with the r you'd probably be up to around 340-350 hp with modest mods like that. with the pontiac5 its tougher to say, but maybe you could get it up to 275-285 (if a chip is available) without getting into the big money mods.

probably the biggest advantage of the r aside from awd is the 4c suspension. i really don't know why anyone would say it doesn't feel as planted when all reviews i've read state that you would not want to use the advanced setting on the r unless you were on a track. sounds pretty planted to me. but i haven't driven both car, so take that for what its worth."
219,"my audi 1.8t cvt has been a pleasure going on 7 months and counting. the car handles like a dream, has more than enough power and has been dead on realiable to date. kudos to audi for such a fine automobile."
220,"hi. i am trying to decide between the pontiac5 and a bmw 330i, and wud appreciate any ideas on what else i shud try. (i've tried both car plus the is300 and the mazda). i was almost sold on the pontiac5 until i read about its brake and cd players problem. plus people are not pleased with infiniti's service.

i guess now i have no option, b/c the only comparable car to a pontiac5 (bmw 330i w/ performance package--a must. otherwise it's too slow.) is too much $$$. after receiving hyundaient service from both honda and saab, i have no interest in getting crap from any service dept./dealer. i mean, saab gives you a loaner even if you are getting an oil change! and they just finished replacing the entire 200 watt harmon kardon sound system on my 9-5 because one speaker was fried (which was me playing the music too loud, not a defect). i definitely do not want to downgrade either in car quality (my 9-5 has been perfect) or service.

however, i just did some research on lexis and and infiniti is rated very high by jd power and associates.

for initial quality for the 2003 model year:

1. lexus
2. cadillac
3. infiniti

8. bmw
11. honda
14. mercedes benz benz
29. mazda
32. saab

for dependability in 2003 (this rated vehicles of the 2000 model year after 3 years):

1. lexus
2. infiniti

13. bmw
12. saab
26. mercedes benz benz

for 1998 models after 4 years:

1. lexus
2. infiniti

10. bmw
16. mercedes benz benz
19. saab

yet the bottom line seems to be that even tho infiniti sells great car, it has never developed the cachet of lexus, much less bmw, etc. so it is desperate to sell car. it is trying to rebuild its line (and nissan) out of the slump brought on by the weak yen and the success of lexus.

of course, the problem is that it seems to be caring more about getting customers than keeping customers.

unless i get this car for below invoice, i won't take the chance on crappy product or service.

am i right?"
221,"i think the volvor is nice inside , has soft leather all around, infiniti has more hard plastic. imo orange gauges look horrible in pontiac5 while volvo has cool looking blue.
clutch is stiffer in pontiac5, volvo has a light but spring loaded feel. the shifter of the g vibrates and takes a lot to get used to when shifting into reverse (far right and downward motion) volvo doesn't vibrate and shifts into reverse more normally( what i'm used to)
both look good but have totally different looks g 35 has that japanesse looks whiel volvo has a more sedated euro look.
volvo steering feels looser at low parking lot speeds but tightens up when speed is increased. g-35 feels a little tight. both stick to the road and both seemed like they stop pretty well. i did not feel tubro lag and volvo had pop when accelating. volvo is awd and weighs more(don't need awd in fla) i think the volvo is a little faster and hold a little better big 18"" wheels w p zero's.
so my delema is which one do i get.
what will hold up betterin the long term. volvor is awd which i guess is nice but really isn't needed in fla.
one is more expensive but is damm good both in and out. one is cheaper looks better out then in.
i think the pontiac5 sedan wont hold value as well as the volvor because they will be produced in greater quanity.
any opinions would be appreciated."
222,has the best residual of any coupe sold right now including bmw - per kilingers who i think does lease residuals. the sedan supposedly is worth 56% after 4 years and the coupe 62%. i'll live with that. volvo with turbo may not be the easiest car to unload 4 years old.
223,if you want accurate information on lease residuals the car-man in the finance and warranty board will be able to tell you.
224,what the residuals are. kiplinger provides finance co's with residuals.
225,if you want to acquire a car you have to go to the dealers and negotiate a deal. bmw have had htoyotaorically very high residuals while infiniti has had htoyotaorically low residuals. nothing i have seen or heard of has changed this. but you have to be willing to go toe-to-toe witht he dealer to get the best deal.
226,"is just that htoyotaory. residuals change all the time - get the facts before you decide based on a forum with old information.
ps there is no negotiating the resiudual. it is what the bank tells you it is and no car dealer can change it"
227,"there may be not negotiating the residual, but everything else is up for grabs including the cap cost. htoyotaory is useful in that it gives a sense of the future. reputation which is the companies number one asset is based on htoyotaory."
228,link: lease nissanons - ask here.
229,of cap cost and residuals reflect market sentiment of a used car in the past. nothing other than current residuals and money costs matter right now for a new car purchase. if htoyotaory is an indication of future perfmance meaningful info is best found elsewhere such as the jd power results. when residuals for 4 years out are best in class right now - why would you look at the past. markets change - dont buy stocks this way
230,most people buy blue chip stocks based on past htoyotaory. i don't anyone who throws out a blue chip stock because they had a bad quarter. usually look at the bigger picture. the same with lease residuals. the reason they are high for bmw is htoyotaorically people are willing to pay a good dollar for bmw used vehicles.
231,"there is no fluffy big picture to a quantitatively defined lease residual. the g coupe gets best in class in kiplinger's december personal finance issue. bmw get some nice comments as well but right now - the only thing that matters is what the math works out to be on a deal done today. by virtue of today's lease residuals it costs less to buy g coupea as opposed to a bmw ~ all else equal.

you're not wrong to say that people have htoyotaorically paid more for used bimmers e it's true. now the reality is people will pay the most for a g coupe of any car out there. infiniti has had great car for thier entire extoyotaence and now the market has bidded up one car int he lineup to reflect this. bmw manages it's used car markets better than anyone and perhaps nissan learned something. htoyotaory is nice but inadequate in most cases to accurately determine future trends. people who look backwards only in portfolio management get fired. in fact the real finds are in places where htoyotaory has not been so kind."
232,"htoyotaory is generally the only accepted principal in the financial markets. i'm not sure why you say it isn't. you are correct, lease residuals are enforce for a deal done in this specific minute. they can change in one day. but kiplingers doesn't make the market, they report the financial news and again the reason bmw lease residuals are typically high is due to the overall demand of used/cpo vehicles.

check this link for a comparision between bmw/audi/infinity:

car_man ""lease nissanons - ask here"" oct 7, 2003 7:19am!keywords=allin:msgtext%20limit:.ee9394d%20pontiac5"
233,"the statemnt i was rebutting

"" nothing i have seen or heard of has changed this. but you have to be willing to go toe-to-toe witht he dealer to get the best deal. ""
 
read the article. the bank buys the residual info from some one who analyzes the market. if not kiplinger then who. even if they are reporting the facts only...you can say you've seen this change.

re the financial discussion perhaps we should take it elsewhere. the only fundamental principal held by chartered financial analysts, the highest designation for institutional money managers is having a basis for representing to a client that an invstment is suitable based on his needs. this specifically has to based on forward looking fundamentals. reversion to the mean priciples suggests that what has done well in the past will not in the future and vice nissan.
htoyotaory is about the last place you can justify an investment to a board a judge or the disciplinary body that can revoke the charter. any one in money magagemnt - not a broker - will tell you htoyotaory only serves to put a company on the radar for your selection process. if you want to read up on this type ""modern porfolio theory"" into google"
234,"i didn't get my lease from a bank and it's either 62% or 63%. as of one month ago, the above link suggested infiniti was points behind bmw. if it is now changed, it's changed, and it will change tomorrow again. but again htoyotaory suggests that bmw hold a higher residual than infiniti. if infiniti is pumping up the residual there will be a glut of used pontiac5s available at bargain basement prices in a few years."
235,66% for a coupe g after 3 years. read it one more time - december issue. infiniti can not set the residuals - the banks do. any time i say bank it's interchangable with financial institution. did your mom lend you the money? most institutions have similar numbers. it will change tommorrow but probably not drastically. the glut of ubtoyotauitous 3's may drive that down - could be time to get a deal on a cpo 325!
236,"chrisboth - the lending instutition sets the residuals. if the lending institution is wholly owned by the manufacturer they can set any residual they want.

will someone come forward and say they leased a pontiac5 coupe with a 66% residual? what was the money factor? i'm not buying kiplingers to see what the infiniti residuals are."
237,and if they set it too high they lose thier job or business. predicting values 3-5 years out is an art and setting them this high has to be based on great market percpetion and actual values obtained in used car markets. you get stuck with 66% of a car you have to be able to make money on it still. apparently institutions belive the g is the best coupe out here based on available and recently changed residuals.
238,"in leasecompare.com the best residual for a pontiac5c is 62%, the best residual for a bmw 330i is 56%. standard 36 month lease with 0 down buying the car at msrp yields these payments:

bmw 330i: $597/mo
pontiac5c: $496/mo

$100 difference. just wanted to throw some numbers out there. personally, i lease what i like and don't let residuals make the choice for me. my audi has a much lower residual than both the pontiac5 or the bmw, but i enjoy the heck out of it.

my 2 cents

speed"
239,interesting comparing apples to apples leasecompare.com gave slightly over a 50% residual on the pontiac5.
240,"""old information"" it does not reflect what actually happens currently. ie not real time such as the awesome tmv sponsored by this site.

it's a better residual now there is no going back"
241,"probably extremely accurate, check it out!"
242,"btw...leasecompare.com uses residuals from leasing companies. most folks will lease through the manufacturer's financing arm, and those residuals tend to be much better than those from leasing companies. if nmac wants to to subsidise 66% residuals, that's ok, i am sure the money factor is adjusted for the higher residual anyway so it balances out."
243,"speedracer, you are right. in cases where companies offer higher residuals they would demand high interest (or money factors, if you'd prefer). in my experience the manufacturer's own financial company usually gives the higher residuals. however, beware that even though the monthly payments of high-res/high-mf & low-res/low-mf come out the same, if you decide to buy the vehicle at lease-end you would have to pay more for the higher residual. personally, i've found the residual values on car.com to better reflect what i see on used-car ltoyotaings."
244,"""you decide to buy the vehicle at lease-end you would have to pay more for the higher residual.""

then one should be buying outright from the beginning. leasing for 3 years and then buying is more expensive than buying outright from the beginning."
245,"as everyone should know, nissan/infiniti fortunes have changed completely the last few years, including residuals, so the past is not much of an indication. apparently there's a auto research that predicts five year residuals, and obviously pontiac5 is not five year old yet. it predicts the g coupe will have the best five year residual in its class, which includes bmw.

in the non-premium market, nissan residuals are moving closer to the perennial leaders honda & toyota."
246,"the '04 tl is rated number 1 in a comparison of 15 ""near luxury"" automobiles. consumer reports is the most respected publication for reviewing automobiles because they accept no advertising. furthermore, cr rated acura the number one manufacturer in the world for reliability two months ago- based on most recent models; 1999-2001.

it was ranked number 1 based on performance, luxury, sportiness, value and reliability."
247,"not knocking acura or cr, but jd powers website presents different information on reliability, just look it up.

serious sports sedan enthusiasts recognize inherent limitations of fwd vs rwd. yes - so if you want a good ""value"" automobile an acura is it. actually the best ""value"" around is the stripper pontiac5 without leather for $26k for $10k less. if you want to drive the best entry level sports sedan in the world, it's the bmw.

btw bmw was given the alg awards for having the highest residual value of any manufacturer. you can read about it, on their website."
248,"""consumer reports is the most respected publication for reviewing automobiles because they accept no advertising. furthermore, cr rated acura the number one manufacturer in the world for reliability two months ago- based on most recent models; 1999-2001.""

cr is known for mom and pop minvan level reviews of car they have no business even driving. most enthusiast would probably ignore cr and look to the true auto mags for opinion before buying. cr is great for people who know nothing other than what people tell them and want a toyota."
249,"wellll, that is your opinion, of course. others are free to hold their own opinions as i'm sure you will agree."
250,any auto reviewer that can state 530i is the best sport sedan ever tested regardless price must know something about automobiles.
251,"yep, hear ya.

but that vehicle probably doesn't fit into the discussion subject here, and cr isn't the subject either, so let's get back to talking about near luxury performance sedan.

and happy new year!

:-)"
252,"i looked at buying a bmw 330i when i was looking at the 04tl. i bought the new tl ( auto with nav ) because the equivelant features on the bmw were $10k more. everything was ""extra"". i am sure the 330i is a killer ride and will outperform the tl in the twtoyotay parts of the road ( but by how much?). then again even after paying many extra $$$ for the performance package..the 330i is still down 35hp to the tl. i used to road race motorcycles and if i only had a buck for every time i passed people in a corner only to watch them go flying past on the straight because they had more hp. how many of you actually drive your car hard enough in a corner to get the extra benefit of the rwd on the 330i ? many of you do however drive fast on the freeway in a relatively straight line or drive in the snow. i'll take the $10g's and the 35hp and the stereo and the nav and on and on and on."
253,"""( but by how much?). ""???

that is exactly the nissanon. when you plunk down $35k for a tl when you can get a perfectly acceptable hyundia for $12k, you start to ask yourself, is the extra $23k worth it. is the tl over 3000% better? of course it isn't. you just like to make yourself feel better when you think your paying less for something that you believe to be equivalent and you are really making out -because there is something that can't be used that cost money in the other item, but people can't take advantage of it.

that is the whole value equation in life. for me, either i'll get the hyundia and pocket the $23k difference, or i'll spring for the extra $10k."
254,"right...how could anybody possibly take an unbiased, 68 year old publication who's auto test department includes a 327-acre state-of-the-art test track and auto-testing facility, that seriously?

get real chrisboth. your summation of cr is without any factual basis. all you have managed to do is compromise your own credibility."
255,"how in the world can you compare the price difference between a $12k hyundia and a $35k tl? it makes no sense. there is no logic to your statement. the car are in two different leagues. by your logic, why would you even buy the 3 series? it is just an entry luxury sedan. why not spring for an extra $20,000 and get a 5 series sedan, or another $35,000 and get a 7 series, or an audi audi. and, if you don't want to spring for the extra cash, then why did you buy the 3 series in the first place, just buy the hyndia you keep talking about."
256,"calm down bmwdoug. you're missing the whole point, man.

noboby can make outlandish comparisons and generalizations like kd can. he's taken playing the devils advocate a whole other level. just sit back, relax and watch a real master at work, dude. you'll learn something.

ok. sorry for the interuption, kd. the floor is your again. please tell us the story one more time, about how the tl is a communtoyota plot to overthrow this country, and the lexus es, is our performance(?!?!) sedan savior."
257,"don't get into a debate with kd on value because to him, if you're not spending the money to drive a bmw, you might as well save as much as possible and buy a hyundai.

i don't think there's any right answer on value. bmw has prestige and road handling that is in a class by itself and if you must have those 2 things, then spending the extra money for the bmw is worth it.

if prestige does not matter to you and you're happy with a car which handles 90% as well as a bmw, then clearly it's not worth it to get the bmw.

everyone's value system and economic means are different and results in different valuations of car. if i'm making $50 million a year, i don't care about a $10k difference in car prices between a bmw and something else (it's less than 1% of my net worth) and i'll get what i want. if i'm making $50k a year, that extra $10k represents a much greater portion of my income (20% of my net worth) and i would not part with it unless i felt the car was 20% better.

frankly, i'm sick and tired of the fwd vs. rwd debate. i have driven a ton of both fwd and rwd car and just b/c a car is rwd doesn't mean it automatically drives better than a fwd car. mercedes benz benz for example makes a pretty fine car, and it's rwd, but most mercedes benz benzes i have ever driven have not been the greatest handling car (please note that i have not driven every model mercedes benz benz, just going by personal exp. so no need to flame me for above statement).

for example, i had to drive my cousin's ml320 this weekend to get more food for my new year's party (his car was the last one in the driveway so was the only one available).

well the seat and the sound system in the ml320 were great. the stiff steering, the sway in turns, and lack of feel on the road were awful. i hit double curves at 70 mph in that ml320 to test it out and came out thinking, hmmm, this was a bad idea. the ml320 is a nice luxury car and has a much nicer interior than my acura acura, but in terms of handling, my fwd acura kicks the rwd ml320."
258,"""please tell us the story one more time, about how the tl is a communtoyota plot to overthrow this country, and the es is our performance(?!?!) sedan savior.""

i'm not advocating any one car, because i think they are both hyundaient car for the individual who wants to purchase them.

i do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x, when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway you'll never use all of car x's ability. that's all well and good but you have to add the four little letters: imho. who is anybody to suggest to me, how i should spend my money and whether a particular car is worth it to me and whether i will or won't derive any added benefit for paying more? this train of thought can be applied against any two vehicles.

that being toyotad, sometimes people will compare vehicles that are not really in the same target market and look at each vehicle on their own merits and then make a choice. sometimes it doesn't matter if you get a two or seven seater and you can compare the two seater with the seven seater and each can be good in their own right. and a point in time either can satisify your requirements.

saugatak - this is not a bmw thread and comparing these two vehicles has nothing to do with bmw. i am very mazdar with both car and each of these are fine vehicles in their own right. they offer different qualities that make them very attractive to potential purchasers. there is not one worldly overridding value equation that would make anyone jump at one car or another. if there were, a manufacturer wouldn't be able to give their vehicles away."
259,"""noboby can make outlandish comparisons and generalizations like kd can. he's taken playing the devils advocate a whole other level. just sit back, relax and watch a real master at work, dude. you'll learn something.""

most people call it being argumentative and find it annoying."
260,"saugatak - i am going to respectfully suggest you are missing the point of this whole thing and in the course of not understanding the point you call people argumentative. it is not about, which car is better because every car has it's compromises. and after all it is not you that is financing my car, it's me. it is about what is the best car for me. the es and tl, as every other vehicle each have it's plus and minus and i'm going to make a decision based on what i believe is the right choice for me. doesn't matter what cr, jd power, edmunds, you or anybody else says."
261,"""most people call it being argumentative and find it annoying.""

yeah...but only if you take him seriously. why would any thinking individual do that???"
262,"as far as the rwd vs fwd debate, to some people it makes a big difference, for whatever the reason is to a particular person. a bmw 3 series, like the tl, like the es is not a ""one size fits all"". it depends on what one considers a priority in the vehicle they are purchasing. there is no one ""rightly"" engineered vehicle."
263,"shenkar: lol

kdshapiro: kd, you are the only person missing the point so let me spell it out for you.

you continually go around demanding that everyone respect your choice of car, but you show absolutely no respect for any other person's choice of car--unless of course that person chooses a bmw.

you continuously make fun of the tl, you say that you prefer the looks of a lexus es330 over a tl but you also like the looks of the pre-bangle and post-bangle bmw but don't like the look of pontiac pontiacs (real headscratcher), you keep saying if you're not getting a bmw buy a hyundai, you say the criticism of consumer review is worthless because it ranked the tl over the bmw (i didn't notice any such criticism when the bmw was ranked above the tl), i mean this ltoyota is endless.

the only constoyotaent theme in your wildly inconstoyotaent statements is buy bmw (do you own shares?). you keep talking about your objectivity but i don't see it. you say every car has tradeoffs and when i ask you what tradeoff the x5 has your response is ""it doesn't seat seven."" lol, that is scathing criticism!

some people have sold their soul to the devil, kdshapiro has sold his soul to bmw."
264,"there really isn't any comparison between fwd and rwd. they may both generate similar track numbers, though even that is unlikely, but they will do it in an entirely different way. when you put 60% or thereabouts of weight up front and have the drive wheels do the steering, you will get a different driving experience.

as for value, the is300 manual is the sleeper. you get near 330i performance, luxury, and equipment for 325i price. not to mention reliability, warranty, customer service, etc."
265,"""you say the criticism of consumer review is worthless because it ranked the tl over the bmw ""

i don't know what cr toyotad, since the only issue i have is the 2004 auto guide. in that issue cr toyotad something like the honda is almost as good as the 2004 tl for $5k less.

and i'll say it again, unabashedly...if you want the best driving toyotamics the bmw is the benchmark. the bmw isn't for everyone just like the tl isn't for everyone, but it is the benchmark in the entry level luxo sports sedan market.

you have to choose the vehicle that you feel toyotaable with. everything else you toyotad in your post is garbage."
266,"riez, i didn't know that the is300 had a stick. i will have to take a close look at it. thanks for the tip."
267,"when i was car shopping in the early 90's, i had just been blessed with my first child and was, hondaingly, shopping for my first ""family"" car. cr had a shootout involving the honda honda and the toyota toyota. the honda, hondaing to them, had better road feel, better acceleration, better brakes, better handling, etc (they labelled it the ""driver's car"" of the comparison). the toyota, on the other hand, was quieter, had better trunk access, was slightly larger (if i remember correctly), etc. the toyota won the comparison based on stuff that was mostly unimportant to me but was definitely important to others. (fwiw, i ended up with an nissan, but that was based on a financial decision above all else... for as reliable as it was, i never really liked that car).

anyway, i think cr is an hyundaient source of, mostly, objective info. the buyer has to decide what is most important for their driving style and lifestyle, take the appropriate car out for a test-drive and then choose hondaingly."
268,"that's one of the best guarded secret's in the industry. :-)

lexus did themselves a huge dis-service by releasing a good sport sedan in auto only for quite a while. infinity did it with the pontiac5, but they followed pretty quickly with the manual tranny and were pretty good about letting people know it was coming soon."

270,"""okay, so you want other people to write ""imho"", but how come you don't preface your posts with the four little letters""

""i do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x, when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway you'll never use all of car x's ability. that's all well and good but you have to add the four little letters: imho.""

jrock - at times you appear to be articulate, so here is a further explanation. the above quote from the original poster is an opinion, but it's also appears to be a thinly veiled opinion disguised as jealously. to reach that conclusion i draw on my own experience. i toyotad similiar things to a friend of mine who wanted to purchase a 911. i asked him how he could justify the purchase of a 911 because the roads are crowded and you'll never be able to use all of the abilities of the car anyway and you are never going to track it. why don't you get an bmw it's about half the price?

he toyotad to me: ""because i want it and i can."" now that was me being jealous. i think we all do this stuff. now jrock - let me add imho.

but we could beat this till the cows come home. cr does provide objective, factual information. i have been a reader since i was 16. and i do trust more than any other magazine their factually gathered information on autos. however, my reliability experience with car has not jived in the past with theirs. in addition, as kominsky stated above, my priorities have not meshed with their priorities. when they pick a top rated sedan, they do so for general populace. sometimes it's just not the car i'm looking for due to other reasons, and i pick a car that's not quite top-rated by them, but offers me what i need."
271,"imho, the bmw 3 series is the best handling car in the bunch, hands down. moreover, you get the prestige of a ""premium"" nameplate if you don't mind giving up heated leather seat, sunroof, cd changer, nav and other niceties that are included in a comparably priced tl. also, if you are single or have a family with small kids only (rear seat space and trunk size), the bmw is ideal because its relatively smaller size enhances nimbleness. if you are concerned about snow (rwd), get the new awd beemer, which costs a couple of grand more.

having toyotad all of the above, i would rather get the pontiac5, which gives up little (if any) in performance and handling when compared with the beemer, and use the $$ savings in filling up the gas tank that gives me miles of driving pleasure, plus the reliability of infiniti to boot :-)"
272,"saugatak... the is300 manual has been on the market since my2002. the is300 came out in my2001, but only with an automatic. the sportcross (touring) also came out in my2002.

keep in mind that the is300 does have a 5-speed manual. 5th is a slight overdrive. you can only get the 5-speed manual in the sedan. the sportcross version comes only with the 5-speed automatic.

you can get lsd with both transmissions, but you can only get vehicle stability control (vsc) with the automatic.

can be a bit hard to find a 5-speed manual. many lexus dealers aren't keen on them since the overwhelming vast majority of lexi ever sold had automatics. check with some dealers.

love my '04 is300 5-speed manual. absolute blast to drive. fun, efficient car."

my post was the one that started this discussion and it is interesting that most of the subsequent discussions weren't discussions about the car but were mostly personal discussions about the people posting.
i don't think i neeed to put imho on anything i write since it should be apparent that it is my opinion because i am writing it !
my point was more along the lines of value for performance and ""near luxury"". i think the tl is the winner on those merits because i get more for my money with the tl. paying an extra $10k for the prestige of the bmw name is ok if what you want is prestige. i am sure the guy in the 330i i blew off at the stoplight the other day is telling himself he has more ""prestige"".
i am not sure every 330i owner is going to lose me on twtoyotay road sections but i do know what 35hp in a straight line means. it means he better lose me in the twtoyotay sections because he will give it back when the road straightens out.
for the $10k i didn't spend on the bmw 330i do you suppose i could make even more performance improvements or make many ""near luxury"" improvements to my tl? oh, that's right the tl already comes with more than the bmw !
i saw a 2004 bmw yesterday....not a pretty car."
274,"some people don't ford on the value side of the equation. i do and i don't and it depends on what i'm getting. sometimes i want the best. i felt the $5k more for the driving experience of a bmw is worth every penny. i spend a lot of time in my car and this is the most fun i've ever had. keep your supposed goodies.

the 3 series goes to 60 in 5.6 seconds and has a top speed of 153, does the quarter mile at about 98 and 14.(recent car and driver). i'm sure the guy you blew off at the light was laughing at you thinking: ""this guy has a new car and has to show it off, it's just not worth it"". stop light races never impress me. let's go to the track.

if you believe people buy bmw for prestige, than all people have to buy the upscale brands for prestige as well. after all why would one buy a bmw for prestige, but not an acura, the upscale division of honda, for prestige? if one wants to argue about the amount of ""prestige"" a car has go ahead. i sincerely believe people buy a car because of the reputation of the manufacturer.

one ltoyota thing about value. i don't need to be told a tl has more value than a 330, a honda honda has more value than a tl, a mazda 6 four-banger has more value than an honda, an hyundai has more value than a mazda 6 four-banger. it's a given, the less you spend on a car the more value it has because it is fulfilling a basic need of getting you from point a to point b. what somebody on this forum would want to know is what is the rational for purchasing one vehicle over another. prestige, poseurs, kinds of people who buy automobiles etc, don't answer that nissanon, they are only self-serving reasons.

""i saw a 2004 bmw yesterday....not a pretty car.""

it's a heck of a lot more handsome than the acura tl. but that's imho."

276,leave it to riez to find common ground.:)
277,"""if prestige does not matter to you and you're happy with a car which handles 90% as well as a bmw, then clearly it's not worth it to get the bmw.""

the last tome i looked at comparison stats the 330i handled about 90-95% as well as the g...prestige notwithstanding.

as far as cr being reliable in terms of performance oriented reviews, i agree with kdshapiro in that they targtet the mass buyer and will point out some very intersting negatives occasionally. there are many imo that will agree that they are a little more toyota and michevroletn comparison worthy than 350z and zhp worthy. 50,000 acre test facililty wont get them better drivers or more enthused drivers.

all the arguments about the price/value equation have the same old value is in the eye of the beholder ending. the thing people forget with the g is that prestige is not paid for in the diplacement department and if a hypothetical buyer wants to get into the low 14 game with world class brakes and handling, he can get it for 28k. want a comparable 330i and how much is it? 10k more at least. the whole value thing gets blown out of proportion and people need to relilze that bmw is excxlusive in that they will beat you to death with any options and everything is optional. that add'l .5 litres is a big nut and takes a very reasonable platform that can be had for a pretty good priced and makes it the same price as a 5 series.

someone above toyotad you could spend 20k more than a 3 and just get the 5 series - no - you can spend less and get a 5 series in some cases. the 3 is pricey cuz people will pay it. it's called good marketing and great product/name perceptions."
278,"""it's called good marketing and great product/name perceptions.""

yes and i'd like to add it's also called execution and delivery. bmw products deliver. they are not an empty shill.

chris it's always about value. it never stops being about value, but everybodys' definition is different. that is why some people will buy a $70k rolex and some people a $10 timex. who am i to tell the $70k rolex buyer it does not represent good value to them. they after all both tell time.

i can't. you can only buy what you believe fits you and your lifestyle. you will buy as much as finances allow, not less. that's why you ridicule a hyundia. think of how the less fortunate must feel when they get their first new hyundia."

284,"on braking, are you referring to the infiniti tl which has brembos, or are you referring to the 5at tl which does not?

second, i don't understand why bmw just does not up the horsepower in its inline 6s. those engines have been around for a while. with all the work bmw has done on its vanos v8s, surely they can migrate some of the technology down and free up some additional horsepower.

i've heard that honda has the ability to get 350 hp out of its basic sohc vtec v6 engine. if true, that is amazing engineering and good news for acura fans because we'll always be ahead of everyone else when it comes to the hp game. of course, honda had better make a rwd platform soon so we can take advantage of that power!

no matter what bmw fans say about ""well i could beat u on the track"" or ""i don't have torque steer"" or ""if the roads were winding you'd eat my dust"", fact is raw horsepower is incredibly useful and most racing occurs not in tracks or windy roads, but on freeways or from stop light to stop light.

every time i'm merging into the right line of a busy highway with a short exit dodgep and i see that 6-ton trailer coming in my rear view mirror, i'm glad for all the horses i have and am happy for more.

i find that these discussions always start off comparing value, driving toyotamics, prestige, etc. but at some point the ultimate argument gets unleashed: ""keep telling yourself how much better your car is while you eat my dust and look at my car's disappearing [non-permissible content removed].""

it's great that tl drivers can make the ultimate argument."

actually raher, you have been nasty. i spent a lot of time at the track when i was younger. i'm not saying bmw is the be all and end all but performance and value, are completely opposite. if you think the tl will track better than the 3 series more power to you. btw racing non-street legal car is a whole different ball game than taking your street legal almost unmodified car to the track.

hey raher, my bimmer has been to the shop..oh lets' see may 2003 last, before that august 2002. i think once a year to the shop for an oil change is sufficient. total out of pocket costs to date: $0. i think it qualifies as reliable.

btw what point are you trying to make in your post????"
287,"speaking of what point are you trying to make...i am not following your observation that taking non street legal car to the track is a whole different ball game than taking your street legal almost unmodified car to the track. what was your first clue ? what is your point ?
i am fairly certain that the stattoyotaics on repairs etc for bmw's probably include a few more car than just yours. i am on my third acura and have never had a problem. acura is rated as the number one most reliable automobile between 1999-2003 by your favorite uninformed magazine, consumer reports.
my point in the original post ( remember i started this discussion ) and my continuing point on this subject is that for $35k i believe the '04 acura tl is the best value out there in a 4 door automobile. what you get for a given amount of money is one way to measure value. you get more for $35k in the tl than any of it's competitors.
btw, ""hey raher"" ? nice touch."

290,"one other important thing missing from those stats is price.

i don't have that info from the mag handy, but that 330i apparently had the performance pack. add in all the options already included in the tl and it looks to me to stack up something like this:
tl - $33k
330i - $47k

maybe someone can correct me if i'm wrong."
291,"you absolutily right, comparable equipped 330 does cost more that10k over tl.

and one more thing 330 for 35k does not have better performance in any way. like kd, i am going to make huyndai example her. 330 without performance package is like huyndai in every way in and out."
292,"correct but you still get a car that will outhandle the tl on a track, or a street.

hondaing to our worthless source cr, the standard 330i will outhandle the standard pontiac5. i am sure the standard pontiac5 will outhandle the standard tl. therefore the standard 330i will outhandle the standard tl.

i don't begrudge the tl anything, you can have your goodies, but i'll take the driving experience. for those who think the 330 with performance package costs $47, blueguydotcom got his for about $39k. you might want to search the bmw board for more information. no, it wasn't a stripper.

but all of this is academic until both these car are taken to the track.

that's right shapiro...porsche's!"
295,"at this year's 2004 los angeles auto show, acura unveiled its tl a-spec concept. this car sits on a two inch wider track with 21 inch wheels and is powered by a modified 3.2-liter v6 that puts out a total of 300 hp!

if this car makes it to production (and it probably will), it will leave the 330i in the dust and give the bmw a run for its money."
296,"i saw the arguments about the tl and the 330. it is all about the buyer's choice. i love my 03 bmw and i also love my 03 pontiac5. they are imho exceptional car for the price i paid. i believe bmw handling can not be easily matched with a car in the same price range, except the chevrolet. pontiac5 is also an hyundaient car and handles almost as good as the 330, i got the g because i didn't want another bmw 3 series. the car is exceptional when it comes to performance and the looks, many people talk to me about the car in parking lots and gas stations. meanwhile an bmw is as we know bmw.
i recently test drove the tl (actually borrowed it from the dealer - manager is my friend) and there was so much hype about the car, so i got it for a couple of hours (their demo) drove around the town. and i was quite impressed, it is a way better car than the old tl. but the hype in my opinion is not well worth.
the sound system works hyundaient if you actually have a dvd audio disc (they had one that was sent from the factory i think) and it is just hyundaient quality. but when you put a regular cd it is nothing ordinary.
the performance, it has hyundaient pick up, but the fwd downgrades the potential of this car. whatever others say, there is the torque steer, this car would have been hyundaient as an rwd, and i think as far as the pick up (in street start the g will beat the tl, well we know bmw performance is something else)
the interior is good quality but does not match the refinement of the bmw 3 series or the audi or the mb, but better than the g. the interior space was less than the g along with the trunk space. i guess the g is a larger car overall and that makes a lot of difference, especially for me with a family and lots of people in the car at all times. i think interior space is similar to 3 series sedan. i am 6'3"" and with my seating position there was almost no space at the back of the driver's seat (a similarity to the 3 sedan)
the handling of the car is not as refined as the 3 or the g. i realized this when i was entering a highway dodgep at about 60-65 mph, and felt the need to hold the steering wheel with both hands very steady because the car almost got out of the road. it was a scary moment, and such wouldn't happen with a rwd 3 series or the g or the audi audi. the handling is of course no issue in straight roads, but not everybody drives crazy like me in the backroads.
i would prefer an audi audi, 3 series or the g for backroads, mountain roads, but definitely not a tl. the car just didn't make me feel toyotaable enough, kind of made me scared in a couple of situations.
the looks are not so much in my style, it feels so dull and very honda like. it doesn't have a untoyotaue feeling of itself. i think they should have worked on the looks a little bit longer.
overall the tl is an hyundaient value for an ordinary daily driver. it offers so much for so less, good interior, good performance, good safety features, and a low msrp.
but for those who don't mind spending the extra cash i know that many will opt for other vehicles. acura tl in my opinion is the choice for first time near-luxo car buyers who do not have the ability of spending another 5k without worrying about their pockets.

i am looking forward to the new vette and most likely i will be the first in line to add the car into my garage. and then maybe trade in the g for the 05 audi audi audi.

meanwhile the argument of bmw is better than tl better than mb better than g better than this that can go on forever. but one need to know that everybody has a different budget, and different reason for buying a car. some people may not mind spending 40k, some people may only afford 34k some can not even afford that and some go out and buy a ferrari for 200k. instead of comparing i think it is best to drive the car and enjoy the purchase.

i honestly did not see a ferrari owner and a lamborghini owner fighting and arguing about their car and try to prove one is better than the other.

if this car makes it to production (and it probably will), it will leave the 330i in the dust and give the bmw a run for its money. car alerady has 270 - another 30 hp does not thrust this car into supercar status especially since it's torque output will prob be about where it is now.

dont forget bmw has a perf pack for the 3 as well...be sure to compare apples.

299,"a new 2004 honda drove up into my driveway last night. it had all the goodies, sat/nav etc. out the door price was a little over $28k. the tl with nav is about $35k. after tooling around in this vehicle i realized the only reason that people would go for the tl at $7k more or the acura which is a four-banger is the ""so-called"" prestige factor of the acura brand.

you could never derive the additional $7k in driving benefit from a tl. and it beats the acura hands down. for the price/feature content this car beats 'em all. of course it is fwd and if you are happy with that you will probably be getting a reliable honda, with a powerful engine and a smooth drive train.

after thinking about it i can see why there might be some people who don't want to spring for the extra money for a 330i to get it identically optioned. it's because the perception is they are actually getting less for their money. i can now see that, as i believe when you buy a tl with nav etc your money has hit the point of diminishing returns against a similiarly equipped honda. you are actually paying more money to get less car.

while i really wanted an x3 due to the ne climate, i might have to reverse myself and say the honda with nav and such offers the best bang for the buck (even though it has torque steer and fwd) and save myself $12 grand, which i can use towards my kids college education or home improvements."
300,"for those who love numbers, compare performance and price numbers for car like the neon srt-4 and nissan se-r spec v. ensure you add the available performance options like lsd to srt-4 and the brembo brake package to the spec v. then compare these car, which cost around $20,000, to the 330i or tl. that srt-4 will run (run over?) the tl or 330i and save you a small fortune in the process. but is it a legitimate comparison?

price to performance is not the only way to go nor even always a relevant comparison."
301,"kd, people buy tl over honda, for the same reason you bought your 330 over 325.

riez, those two car you mentioned have no luxury factor, if i would settle for something like that i would get subaru sti or evolution 8.

zumbalak, looks like you have a lot of experience driving rwd, that is why you had few scary moments driving fwd tl, you dont drive fwd the way you drive rwd. i for example had a few scary moments driving pontiac5 coup infiniti, bacouse i'm not use to pushing rwd to the limit, i even span once."
302,"ppontiac8477... you prove my point. if luxury is the primary criteria, then why are people obsessing about performance numbers? and if price/value is the primary criteria, then there are a lot ""better"" less expensive car out there.

and that leaves us the dilemma of this board: what does it mean to be a ""near luxury performance sedan""? are luxury and performance equal? or is performance more important than luxury? or vice nissan?

i firmly believe in performance taking precedence, but not at the expense of luxury. and other factors like reliability, warranty, customer service, operating costs, etc. cannot be left out of the equation.

but if you don't define terms and weight what is important, all you do is debate apples and oranges? or granny smith apples vs. red delicious apples?"
303,"there have been some recent posts suggesting the tl is overall best value. by whose yardstick are we measuring? and what is the factual criteria?

1. number of goodies
2. size of backseat
3. driving experience
4. hp and torque
5. oveall performance numbers
6. cost and financing
7. drivetrain

what are the soft criteria?

1. looks of vehicle
2. toyotated resale value in x years
3. quality/luxury of interior
4. manufacturer reputation
5. dealer reputation
6. supposed value of automobile (note hard value goes up as total cost decreases, but soft value is based on the compromises one finds in the automobile. for example a hyundai has a lot of hard value, but to some people not a lot of soft value. is hard value or soft value more important?)

one size doesn't fit all."
304,"for me performance is important, but money is also important. for example i would not pay 10k+ more for 330 over tl for only marginally better handling, but worse power train. on the other hand i would pay 20+ more for bmw which has way better handling and way better powertrain."
305,"you finally answered your huyndai nissanon.
both are important and tl would be had to had with 330. if you compare everything you just toyotad, assuming that tl and 330 cost the same , we probably would have a tie. but being that tl cost 10k less, we now know who the winner is:)"
306,"think that's a topic for another board, but i don't think anyone can argue that v6 toyota or v6 honda (will refer to them as camcord from now on) give you best bang for buck. yes, you can get a lower brand car but the camcord is renowned for its reliability and low gas mileage and due to its reliability has a low total cost of ownership (tco).

with respect to the price differential between a nav-honda and a nav-tl, i agree the nav-honda wins in the value equation, but from what i've read (somebody with more exp. with both systems please help me out) the acura's nav system is a lot better. i have not bought any nav systems in my car to this point (i find a $20 map/atlas that i can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value) so i don't know this for sure, but my understanding is that the nav system on the tl allows you to say ""phone home"" and then the car will dial the number for you, whereas this is not possible on the nav-equipped honda.

now this may seem silly to you but i kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons:

1) i never use a cell phone when driving (unless i'm stuck in traffic and need to tell someone i'll be late) because it's dangerous so to be able to make voice-activated calls is incredibly useful. time is money and if i can conduct some business while on the phone and save some time, the nav system on the tl could pay for itself. also, if you must talk on the phone, this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life, which is definitely worth something.

2) one of my favorite shows as a kid was knight rider (in spite of david hasselhoff) because the talking chevrolet with the roving cylon eye was just so cool. there is a fun factor in talking to your car and getting a response back that is hard to quantify.

3) if i buy the tl, it'll be the infiniti so with a stick in right hand and wheel in left hand, voice-activated calling is really more than a luxury, it's almost a necessity.

the point is although objectively the nav-honda beats the nav-tl, i think there are some good reasons to spring the extra $ for the superior acura nav./voice system.

with respect to the current generation v6 honda, i found that honda took all the driving fun out of the current gen. honda. to me, they have the driving feel of a toyota and frankly, the toyota is a better toyota than the honda is. when you compare prices on the non-nav honda v6 and non-nav tl, i think the price difference is only $3,700 (based on my market research that i could get the honda for $600 over invoice and the tl for $2k under msrp based on what's been posted on the prices paid boards).

i think the extra $3,700 is money well spent to upgrade from non-nav honda to non-nav tl. also, i really want a infiniti and unfortunately the honda sedan does not come in infiniti and v6. i'd have to get the honda infiniti v6 coupe.

and my wife's response when i suggested that we save some cash on my car by me getting the honda infiniti coupe was: ""i always sit in the front and you are responsible for putting son in the back seat and pulling him out of the back seat.""

well i like to save money like the next guy, but destroying my back is not the way i'm gonna do it so it's the tl for me."
307,"i don't normally defend kdshapiro, but i really think that his basic point that ""value is in the eyes of the beholder"" is correct.

it's kind of hard to compare the tl to any bmw b/c pricewise it's closer to the bmw but sizewise it's comparable to the bmw.

if you are someone who places a high premium on being able to hit 270 degree exit dodgeps at 65 and really enjoys driving your car beyond 8/10ths on twtoyotay roads, there really is just one sedan out there for you and that's bmw. also as someone who drove a bmw in his 20s, i have to say that i had a much, much easier time picking up hot girls with that car than any other car i've had before or since.

i think if you exclude the 2 factors i mentioned above, the tl whomps the bmw bmw, but getting hot girls with minimal efforts is, as they say in the mastercard commercial, priceless.

ok, i think most of the people on these boards are men and hopefully i haven't offended any women."
308,"tl is right in between 5 and 3 in size, plus its being considered near luxury performance sedan.

everybody have their own opinion on any subject, but consideration by majority puts thing in perspective.

i also place a high premium on being able to get of the corner by accelerating hard, and i believe fwd is better in this department."
309,"your post is interesting in that you are arguing with yourself, at times, as to what is a better ""value"" - the honda or tl.

as many of us have noted, although value is relative, it may also be measured objectively. however, even this objectively quantifiable factor may be viewed subjectively, depending on the viewer's wealth, dispositions and priorities in life, spending habits ... and not to mention the proverbial ""ego"" or ""status"" factor. as to the last factor, people seem quite touchy -- defensively and offensively :-)"
310,"""ok, i think most of the people on these boards are men and hopefully i haven't offended any women.""

i would be more careful if i were you, because i am not sure whether our revered host ""pat"" is patrick or patricia :-)"
311,...the knight rider car was a pontiac firebird not a chevrolet. perhaps the show's producers felt that the firebird offered better value.
312,"ppontiac8477... you write, ""for example i would not pay 10k+ more for 330 over tl for only marginally better handling, but worse power train."" but you can say the exact same thing, only even worse, for the honda v6 vs tl. they are siblings from the same company. thus, if you can't say it for the honda, you can't logically say it for the 330i."
313,"we always end up apples to oranges because we can't agree on even the most basic of things. for example, what is the relevant price spread? is it under $40k? over $25k but less than $45k? for me, i think the ""meat"" of this market segment is in the $27,500-$32,500 range but this segment includes outliers costing at least $25k but no more than $35k. but notice how subjective everything is?

thus, for me, the 330i comparison should be with a stripped one, not a loaded one. the loaded ones and the 330i with perf. pkg push $40k. to me, $40k is squarely in the realm of luxury performance sedan. there ain't no ""near"" at $40k. that is why i went with a loaded is300 manual for approx. $32,500 msrp when a similar 330i was nearly $40k. for $32,500 msrp i could get a decently equipped (but just) 325i but not a 330i. (and i don't want to bring in ed issue.)

wish we had three boards. one for fwd, one for awd, and one for rwd. for me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" fwder. that is an oxymoron. and i wouldn't want the weight penalty that awd brings.

and, staying purely, subjective, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" car with an automatic transmission. so these discussions would only be covering car not controlled (dominated) by slushboxes. ""performance automatic"" is also an oxymoron."
314,the is300 is simply no match for any model tl (automatic or manual) in all categories.

318,"""second, we all know that bmw makes one of the best handling car in the world and it have nothing to do with it's being rwd. if you know mini couper is also made by bmw and it handle better than 3 series, and it's fwd.""

as the saying goes on american idol - ""i beg to diffa"". your statement is incorrect to the extent it is not the size or weight of a 3 series. yes you can make a go-cart perform better than a three series, but make the mini-cooper 3300 lbs, give it four ""real"" seat and it wouldn't outhandle a go-cart. with 0 to 60 acceleration of 8 seconds, i'm not sure how it outperforms the 330i. but in it's weight class, it just does fine. the srt4 also outperformns the 330i, but add an additional 400lbs or so and it wouldn't accelerate it's way out of a paper-bag. add 500lbs and 2 more seat to an s2000 to make it's weight equivalent to a 3 series and it wouldn't perform either. yes it's very easy to make a car that out accelerates any other car, just cut down on seat, and mitigate with weight and you've got a winner. but we are not talking about these types of car.

to some paying the additional $$$ for a 330i, a vehicle with the best drivetrain in the business, smoothest in-line six, vaunted handling is worth it. to others it's not. what's so hard about that?"
319,"shenkar... over the past 50 years, what percentage of ferrari have had automatic transmissions? just check out the resale value of ferrari, comparing automatics to manual."
320,"kahunah... i beg to differ. my '04 is300 manual brings way more many smiles to my face than any fwd tl ever can. and certainly more than any '03 or earlier tl type s automatic! there is nothing less fun than torque steer. and having 60% of weight over the drive wheels isn't my cup of driving tea.

but guessin' we are talking apples to oranges. i'm talkin' pure driving pleasure on real world roads i drive. not tracks we don't drive on or track test results. huge difference.

will be interesting to see how reliable the new tl will be. the is has a proven track record."
321,"""...over the past 50 years, what percentage of ferrari have had automatic transmissions? just check out the resale value of ferrari, comparing automatics to manual.""

riez, i'm just saying you might want to rephrase that last statement in post 332, cause it's false...and i just proved it. the ""past 50 years"" and ""comparing values"" are separate and unrelated issues. i'm only talking about the manual vs automatic argument you made in that post. doesn't hold water, as is."
322,"riez - is somewhat correct but where i live i would never own a manual as a daily driver. so if by definition i don't have a sporty car, so be it. i would however own a ssg/smg or the like. i just don't want to have to put my foot on the clutch."
323,"ok, i am glad you understand that rwd is not everything in performance.

0-60 acceleration have nothing to do with handling, that what i was talking about handling not overall performance. but if you want to go this way tl is fester than 330 0-60, so what's your point?"
324,"is is not 50/50 balanced either, so i don't know why you so proud of it. plus 5mt is not enof for 225 engine, you need at least infiniti to even be close. is have nothing on tl, nothing."
325,"as in your is300 is no match for my 270 hp brembo equipped infiniti tl...on any road! but i didn't have to say it, as others agree also."
326,"riez - is somewhat incorrect, kd. and so are you, if you believe his assertion.

i ask you both to consider, among others: ferrari stradale, modena, spyder, gta, maranello and enzo models, which all have automatic transmission options. would anybody in their right mind presume to say these are not ""performance"" car because they don't have 4, 5, 6 or 7 speed manuals, as riez is asserting?

or what about the porsche turbo, bmw 760i and the bmw, maserati cambio, audi rs6, mercedes benz benz e55, c32, s55, volvo0 and a slew more than i can think of at this moment.

he kinda jumped off the bridge without a parachute on that one, and you playing the devils advocate again, followed him over."
327,"in the same way as your analysis of mini cooper vs. 330i, the 330i would also lose its edge if it had to gain the extra width and wheel base to match pontiac5 and tl, as the 530i indeed does in the handling and accelearation departments to both. bmw has been playing this rigged game of fielding a smaller sausage to win the handling-happy rag writers for a long time."
328,"brightness - you are somewhat incorrect as these car are in the same class. the mini-cooper by definition, or the s2000 is not considered the same class of car. we have been through this connissantion previously, it is what it is. our somewhat worthless cr considers the 530i to be the best car it has ever owned period. i guess that's rigged also?

pp - the 330 goes to 60 in 5.6 seconds. it is what it is. it also goes to 60 in 7.5 seconds. yes there is a range of performance a range of models and a range of price. it is what it is. if you feel better in saying the tl is faster to 60. i'm not gonna disagree."
329,"as with price and performance, this is subjective. which i have repeatedly stressed. for me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" automatic. and the performance and fun-to-drive factor of even a ferrari automatic pails in comparison to the same experience with a manual.

and keep in mind that smg-type systems (used by ferrari, maserati, bmw, aston martin, etc.) are not automatics. they are manual transmissions with software and systems to allow an automatic mode but still don't have a torque converter.

and, yes, car as expensive as the new mb mclaren are still not true performance car. what is up with a hyper expensive ""supercar"" with a 5-speed mb automatic transmission? even autoweek ran a poll on this issue.

shenkar... i stand by my subjective opinion. a ferrari with an automatic transmission is a travesty, one reflected in the future resale market. it is less than what a ferrari could and should be.

kahunah... and your 270 hp tl fwder will also out torque steer my car. too much weight over front wheels which are also drive wheels. fwders can never ford the laws of physics.

ppontiac8477... the is300 sedan is about 54/46. the sportcross (wagon) is about 53/47. not 50/50 but certainly not 60/40. (lexus should've moved the battery to the trunk.)"
330,anyone who thinks a tl is just an expensive honda has apparently not driven both (or they have and just have so little perception of what they are driving). i have. they are not the same in any way. even the shifter and clutch in the honda v6 coupe has an entirely different feel than in the tl.
331,"i guess it depends on your definition of ""performance"".

i'll agree that on the racetrack or on the twtoyotay-bits, the manual equipped car will generally rule...all else being equal. but on the drag strip, or in stoplight skirmishes, the situation is generally reversed. even the car mags acknowledge this. therefore they both deliver performance...just a different kind. and while that may not meet your individual subjective standard, but please don't denigrate car because of that.

i, for one, would love to have an e55 which i think you'll agree could blow the doors off 96% on the car on the road today...regardless of transmissions.

btw...applying the personal bias you've chevroleted to the equation, does this mean that your automatic is is not a ""performance"" car, but your 5 speed is, by virtue of the transmission only???"
332,"my wife's '03 is300 automatic is her ""performance"" car. she cannot drive a manual transmission. my '04 is300 manual is a performance car. almost as much fun as my former '98 540i6 at half the price! do i miss the 4.4l v8 and 6-speed manual? yeah, but i get nearly as many smiles per mile with the 3.0l i6 and 5-speed manual? and the 540i6 didn't have lsd! bmw only offers that in bmw and bmw.

and i can make the same case for my former '96 chevrolet ss (5.7l v8 and 4-speed automatic) versus my former '97 chevrolet (3.8l v6, with perf, handling, & suspension pkg, and 5-speed manual). take the manual any day! much more fun to drive. but if you like to be driven, an automatic is just fine."
333,"your assertion that a car must be rwd to be a ""true"" sports car is preposterous.

compare the is300 to the mazda 6s. both car are within a hair of each other in hp, tq, 0-60 and 1/4 mile acceleration, skidpad grip, slalom speed, and braking dtoyotaances.

even the weight dtoyotaribution is close (54/46 vs. 59/41).

yes, toyotamically fwd and rwd perform differently. from a standing start, the is300 has an advantage over the mazda 6 because it has better traction to the drive wheels. on a racetrack however, that advantage is gone, as it simply requires a different driving techntoyotaue (line) to make a fwd go fast vs. a rwd.

basically, going around a road course quickly involves three elements - power-to-weight ratio, braking performance, and traction. in corners, traction is key because the more you have, the more power you can put down on the pavement. the factor that most affects traction is weight transfer, which is why smoothness is so important for fast lap times.

compared to a fwd car, in a rwd car, turn-in happens sooner because during braking (entry), weight shifts away from the drive wheels, and the resulting loss of traction can cause oversteer. since turn-in is earlier, the apex also comes sooner, causing the line to straighten and allow the driver to begin accelerating. this techntoyotaue obviously won't work well in a fwd car because the ""wrong wheels"" need the traction to exit the corner. therefore, weight transfer through a corner must be managed differently for a fwd car.

if you're hondaing a fwd car into a corner, you adjust your line by braking and turning-in later. this adjusts the line by moving the apex out farther. with a later apex, the fwd'er straightens the line through the turn and can accelerate harder, sooner.

it may not seem as natural to you, but it is no less effective at producing fast lap times.

as far as torque steer is concerned - no it's not fun, but modern high performance fwd car (like the mazda 6 or acura tl) have it managed very well, so if it's present at all, it's more of a dtoyotaraction than a performance handcap.

of course, all of this talk is moot on the street. at 8/10ths, it rarely comes into play.

for the most fun and biggest performance gains, attend a driving school and put good rutoyotaer on your wheels."
334,"""as far as torque steer is concerned - no it's not fun, but modern high performance fwd car (like the mazda 6 or acura tl) have it managed very well, so if it's present at all, it's more of a dtoyotaraction than a performance handcap.""

i just drove the new tl my dinner buddy purchased last week and watched the review on the tl on speedchannel...cant remember the show as i was taking one of my 14 naps over the last two weeks and so was groggy at the time...but the reviewer hammered the thing for having too much power for a front driver.

 all the nice sentiment over fwd is great but the platform will have a limit that this car seems to exceed. the comment was the honda has about the right of power...anyone else see this so as to help me remember the show?

the very thing rear drivers enjoy is the differnt stlye of driving that reat powered car afford us.....that little correction to puposefully oversteer to put the car in line as the weight transfers to the drive wheels is the majic that people wont give up. as a 10 year front driver...they are fun in turns - really...but not as fun and not as easy to apex as rwd.

the chatter from torque steer is one of the most unsettling things you can deal with - not for fear of losing control as fwd are easier to keep in contol...just feels cruddy when your driving and it feels like an earthquake is shaking the wheel...and combined with lsd and traction...its a little bit worse than my acura was."
335,"ok, riez. we'll end this little chat for now. but if i do get that e55, i'll look you and your 5sp is up, and we'll pick this ""performance"" discussion back up then. chiao!"
336,"i haven't driven the tl so i cannot comment on its torque steer. i do admit that 270 hp is a lot to send to the front wheels...

that toyotad, while i don't believe fwd takes away from the fun to be had driving the tl, i do suspect that its 3700# curb weight makes it more of a grand tourer than a canyon carver.

i would take a acura over the tl any day...and in fact, i did!"
337,"acura rocks in many ways - the tl is a sweet ride but it is not a sports sedan at 85-95% of the envelope - while it may perform in curves nearly as well - hell even as well - better? possibly with aspec, it won't feel as competently done.

 that late turn in the fwd offers is kinda neat and i enjoyed it in the acura's i've owned and driven but the rumbling torque steer over bumps or uneven pavement is a very unimpressive offering for you and your passengers in a heavy car even.

the acura may be the best value for that market segment ever. it's very much like the tl in terms of appearance and stance...acura owners must love it! and not vice nissan"
338,"fedlawman... please review the earlier recent posts. as i toyotad, i am not talking smooth test track performance. heck, using that criteria a fwder with a live rear axle can be quite the performer. i'm talking on the real roads i drive every day. on the twtoyotaies. on the curves. on the bumps. (you really appreciate irs when you are taking a nice sweeper fast and you hit a bump. when you lack irs the entire rear bounces up in the air and you say a silent prayer. not unlike torque steer!)

today i had fun ""playing"" with my business fwd hyundai (v6, 5-speed manual with defeatable traction control) in the snow and ice. she tugs and pulls like crazy every time she loses traction. all that weight over the front wheels and those drive wheels trying to steer at the same time they fight for traction. you fight to steer her. just take a corner as you lose some front wheel traction. pulls left then right. laws of physics. that is true for every fwder i've ever driven hard. (and, yeah, i had fun driving '01 tl type s but she torque steered. same for the i35 sport i drove.) only way to go is to ensure the drive wheels are not the steering wheels!

don't forget that 5% of 3,000 pounds is 150 pounds. fwder is like having your pre-teen sitting on your hood all the time."
339,"fwd vs rwd has been debated to death. my personal take is that the difference is overrated.

mb makes rwd vehicles but how well do they handle? every mb i've ever driven has been a nice car but handling wasn not really its strongest charactertoyotaic.

lexus makes both fwd and rwd car, but aside from riez's favorite is300 (lol, he has 2 of 'em), i would really have to ford very hard to tell the difference in the drivetrain. a soft plushy ride completely divorced from any feel for the road sucks whether the drivetrain is a fwd or rwd.

if you really want to make a performance car, you not only have to have the rwd but you need to do all the other things it takes to get the weight balance as close to 50-50. not sure what the exact weight balance on the is300 is riez, but it doesn't sound anywhere close to 50-50, so on that basis infiniti pontiac5 and bmw are going to be a lot better than is300.

also, i think if you are used to a rwd and then go to a fwd, the difference is really noticeable so you tend to overemphasize it. the opposite is also true.

for example, i'm now used to my acura and when i had to drive an ml320, it took me a while to get used to the turns. once i got used to it in 5 mins. it was fine.

i find that as long as i have some feel for the road, i can get used to just about any car and drive with my normal skill level, and after a while don't notice it unless i try to go above 7/10ths.

living in the ne, i prefer fwd b/c i can slap on all seasons and not worry about snow tires. yes, you can get a rwd/awd sedan, but those are a lot heavier, so their performance is compromised and they eat up a lot more gas.

when i move to ca, where bad weather isn't as much of a problem, i'd give a lot more consideration to rwd, but i'm not going to let the drivetrain alone influence my decision as to which car i want."
340,"saugatak... be real. just drive a...

fwd lexus es330 and a rwd is300.

fwd cadillac seville and a rwd cadillac cts.

fwd lincoln continental and a rwd lincoln ls.

fwd infiniti i35 and a rwd infiniti pontiac5.

the ltoyota could go on...

(and don't forget that lincoln killed the continental and cadillac is moving back to rwd for next seville. not to mention chrysler and dodge going rwd for the next 300/dodge platforf.)"
341,"""mb makes rwd vehicles but how well do they handle?""

good enough to get you to 180+. you are right the difference is negligible between fwd and rwd for those who can't tell the difference. however, i believe you undertoyotate the number of people who can tell the difference. for those that can tell the difference: ""the difference is real, and it's spectacular."""
342,"riez, try comparing apples to apples (if you absolutely must), not apples and oranges.

saugatak is right about this fwd/rwd thing being way overblown. 99% of the drivers on the road (including you, unless you have a professional racers license) won't notice a bit of difference in their morning commutes to the office.

the overwhelming mass of opinions either way, have been driven by the marketing spin of the manufacturers and the auotmotive press. we bite into something that sounds good, and promote it as gospel when for the vast majority of us...it makes absolutely no difference.

you've found a ride you really like. we're all glad for you. why spoil it for everyone else who may like something different. can't both decisions be valid???"

345,pp...can you way torque steer....? the saab really doesn't count. let's put a superdodge on the is and then give it a shot. might as well compare the mazda 6 to an evo.
346,"yes, if you take the worst handling fwd car and compare them to good handling rwd car, then you are right.

but the point of the post, which you clearly missed, is that first you have to make a good handling car and then putting in a rwd drivetrain will make a difference.

i think a more valid comparison is the es330 vs gs300. both offer soft, plush rides with little road feel. es330 has too little power to have any torque steer. does the drivetrain really make a difference? i mean, how much do i care that a bad handling rwd car might handle slightly better than a bad handling fwd car? i would never push a bad handlng rwd car to the limits anyway so what have i gained with the rwd drivetrain?

riez, it's great you love your is300 so much that you got 2 of 'em lol, but there's a lot more to handling than drivetrain and you know it."
347,"ok, kd. time to retire the hyundai bit, like i had to do with my ""real"" lexus spiel.(:^))"
348,"hello everyone, i test drove both a honda honda coupe, ex v6 with nav and the 325xi yesterday.

it's very interesting to me that the honda popped up a few times in this thread about near luxury car.

i must say that the 240hp honda seemed more powerful than the bmw, with only marginally worse handling. granted i was not on a race track, but this is everyday driving.

i also must say that this honda had every possible option and is $4,000 cheaper than the bmw that has almost no options (not even power seat!) i was hondad that you could actually talk to the navigation system.

finally, i was hondad at how plush the honda was and how spartan the bmw was. the bmw was almost embarassingly untoyotaable on the inside.

all this being toyotad, can anyone really justify goping with the bmw here? also, can anyone justify spending $4k more for the acura tl.

maybe go for the bmw because of 1) all wheel drive and 2) prestige of driving a bmw?

please let me know, thank you."
349,"i dont understand why is that saab does not count, because it stepped on your toes. we are talking about stock car without any additions from after market, hey saab does not have 3.0 v6 like is does.

riez and kd, i wonder how far you two push you rwd car. i have a tl and i really in to car so i have driven quiet a few rwd and fwd car. with that toyotad do you really know your car limits, i bet you don't, because if you do you must of crash it a few times (or be really close to it) to understand were exactly the limit is. in order to compare rwd and fwd you really have to spend alot of time driving each one and really push it to the limit, and that would only be possible only on the race trace or on the empty road at night. i don't think any of you two had this kind of experience and for this meter so as anybody else on this side including myself. so if you think that rwd is better than fwd that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car. while 330 in my opinion has a slight advantage over tl in handling, there is no way you can take advantage of it. as for is, in my opinion it does not even handle as good as tl, so just leave it a that."
350,"pp...it was written tongue in cheek...forgot the smiley...:)

but to answer the nissanon, i push the car pretty darn hard. i don't drive to smash 'er up or to race it, but the predictable response, smooth drivetrain and communicative steering let's me do almost anything. now could a professional push it harder, absolutely.

honda honda v6 to a bmw 325 for $28,000. to me it's no contest, the honda is very nice at that price. i never go for loaded car, but there is a certain level of options that i want. a $28,000 bmw does not have it. having just driven a loaded honda honda, i can say it drives very nicely. could i see myself driving it? absolutely? does it handle anywhere close to my 330i. not a chance. but if the sport in sports sedan doesn't matter, it's a compelling choice.

""i have a tl and i really in to car so i have driven quiet a few rwd and fwd car.""

me too, including a 911.

""so if you think that rwd is better than fwd that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car. while 330 in my opinion has a slight advantage over tl in handling, there is no way you can take advantage of it.""

pp - i agree. if you're idea of handling is to plow threw snow with all-seasons a fwd will outdo a rwd. but i can feel the difference between a great fwd and a great rwd. it is no contest. does it make a difference going to work on traffic clogged streets. no. but that is not what this connissantion is about, or else we would all be driving hyundai (sorry shenkar that's the last of it). a great rwd will be able to outperform in the aggregate a great fwd, because of the balance and power delivery. as i toyotad it doesn't make a difference in traffic cloggeds streets, but that is not what this connissantion is about. what drive-train one chooses is a personal preference. they each have their advantages and limitations.

but let's not confuse the ability of the car with the ability of the driver or amount of traffic on the road."

there is no voodoo or gospel here and no marketing hype. marketing hype is what got fwd to suceed. rwd platfroms offer a lot of good things to a paltform and it makes sense to improve the design of auto's. fwd is a thing of the past i would bet by 2010. rwd with traction control is great for 60% of the country and the rest will be offered awd or ateesa type systems.

the argument that fwd is a good decision isn't invalidated yet neither can you say that it's hype that gets people demanding rwd car. balance is not just weight dtoyotaribution..it's also which way the weight shift when you floor it. rwd is not bad - in fact it's merit's, i believe, and not hype got it on the comeback trail.

the honda i can get for $26-26.5k fully loaded.

the bmw will be $30k minimum.

the point is that if i am going to spend the extra money on a car, i want it to be a bmw, not an acura.

to me, the whole point of the honda is saving the $$$ and getting the options. my whole point of a bmw is the fact that it has the prestige of bmw.

therefore it makes no sense to me to spend $30k on an acura, thereby not getting the prestige but still spening the $$$."
356,"""has a car ever competed with bmw before 02 in the entry lux arena. there were plenty of attempts with fwd but none suceeded until pontiac5 out rwd sedan.""

specifically the bmw though. it's ironic above $40k there is not a lot of competition in the fwd space. aside from the acura rl, what other vehicle is fwd? the is is a competitor and was not overlooked. however, i still think the styling of the is300 is racer-like and not really world class. that would keep me from getting it (although riez loves his). certainly not as nice looking as the sc430."

let's see honda has value, bmw has prestige. sort of ignored the equation in the middle. why someone would want to purchase any car. i could purchase a car much less expensive with much more value than a honda and equal reliability.

let's try it this way. honda has a reputation for providing value in it's car. bmw has a reputation for building car with a level of luxury and performance. that's a much better way of saying honda has value, bmw has prestige."

361,"riez, i agree. kd, i agree. i guess what i'm trying to get at is the relavance of this fight we're having here.

i currently own both fwd and rwd vehicles, and i love them all. they all do exactly what i need them to do. so does that mean that my rwd mercedes benz benz sedan are superior to my '04 fwd nissan nissanvan? certainly not based on drivetrain configuration alone.

there are a very few situations where one or the other will clearly be preferrable, but in most other situations they will be interchangable. i just don't believe there are absolutes when discussing the average driver, on the average road here in america. and i'd be so bold as to say that includes every single one of us (unless you reside in nevada or utah or the like).

we're fundamentally arguing our preferences and prejudices, in the main, and i don't see the need for that since they both are valid in most situations."
362,"""i still say, for most people, driving on public roads in america, the real-world performance differences are negligible at best...non-extoyotaent at worst""

the rear drivers will never let this go. the driving toyotamic is desirable and evident all the time - and i would suggest most of on this board would be above average in our expectations for performance and platform. you dont have to go to utah to enjoy the toyotamics. there may be no merit in arguing which is better f or r drive but there is no way you can say a rwd car is never enjoyed or worth it or needed. the car may be interchangable most of the time if you want to get there but the desirable charachtertoyotaics of rwd are there to enjoy all the time and the preference is more than fluff."

""with nav? tell me where and i'll be there in a flash to purchase it. new? 0 miles? out the door? even edmunds tmv toyotates about $27.5k""

$26.5k is the street price of a new ex-v6 nav. check the honda prices board. edmunds tmv tends to be conservative. the ex-v6 can be had for $24k. it'll depend on location. it is not out the door, since it doesn't take into account taxes, title, regtoyotaration, etc., but the same can be toyotad for any car when comparing prices."
370,"who are you talking to? i didn't see anyone say that. maybe a post was deleted? i dunno.

oh, unless you interpret me saying ""some of the supercar..."" as meaning most don't. well, i didn't want to get into an argument about semantics, so i was being conservative. fact is, not all are rwd, so, obviously, high-end manufacturers don't necessarily believe rwd is the end-all-be-all of performance. that's all i was saying."
371,"i was thinking the same thing, but then looked up the pontiac5 sedan in both rwd and awd, and motortrend ltoyota 65.1 mph slalom for awd and 65.9 mph slalom for rwd. still extremely close and could easily be attributed to being tested on different days and maybe even different locations and maybe even by a different driver, but not provable, so there is really no arguing it. given 2 identical car in every other way accept drivetrain configuration, the extra weight of awd will most likely lose, but, again, on a dry course. oh, and also as long as its a car that doesn't have so much power that it would merely smoke the rear wheels while powering out of the turns."
372,"""oh, and also as long as its a car that doesn't have so much power that it would merely smoke the rear wheels while powering out of the turns.""

the new to be e60 bmw 3.9 to 60 rwd. you don't need awd to do it. it's just another option, just like fwd. but it does add extra weight, reduce gas mileage. sure manufacturers have used it to lay power down 4 wheels at a time."
373,"i was not talking about driving in snow or in the have traffic, i was talking about driving at the high speed and passing car left and right.

i also think that you will not be able to achieve more in rwd over fwd. i was also asuming that one should have the same experience driving both fwd and rwd, you clearly don't have that. for example, i passed 330 on the i95 the other day, and guess what he almost killed himself trying to catch me, i was driving my friend toyota. does it mean toyota is a better car that 330, no, it means the guy can't drive. with that toyotad i think that 99% of the population will not be able to take advantage of rwd, and another 1%( race car drivers) will be smart enof not to do it."
374,"if you live in the north east, should you get awd 330 over a rwd 330. if soemone was given a choice what is the downside to choosing the awd if there is any. (obviously the downside to the rwd is handling in less then clear dry conditions)"
375,"all other things being equal, awd adds weight, complexity, (usually) price, and (often) eats up some interior or trunk space (e.g., see volkswagen volkswagen). of course, it can improve traction.

but tires are the single most important component for traction. get the best tires money can buy.

when looking at test results, you have to look at what track, track conditions, drivers, tires, methodology, etc.

keep in mind that f1, nascar, etc. all have arbitrary rules. nascar uses live axles and carburetors (i can't hardly spell this archaic word). much more powerful f1 car have various restrictions on engine size, etc. f1 car in early 1980s put out 1,200 hp. today they are more like 900 or so hp. there is no racing series i know, reputable and offical, that allows an absolute free-for-all for car--any size, weight, engine size, any engine configuration, turbos, superdodges, nitrous oxide or other performance enhancers, awd, etc. would be fascinating."
376,"you right about tires, it's very important when it comes to handling."

i'm fairly certain i would have passed on a 330i with awd. i don't like the understeer then neutral then oversteer drive feel of an awd car. my friend's subaru is a fun, highly modded car but the awd system makes me very happy to get back into my rwd 330i.

additionally, i'm not impressed by the higher maintenance costs, lower mileage and added weight. btw, i live in southern california, so awd is really only for the snowboarders and the...rock climbers? not many of us face weather that needs awd."
378,"i agree that a well built well designed performance car with rwd is the best handling sedan out there on non-snowy roads.

in 2002 in the northeast when there were a lot of snowstorms, rwd car without snowtires got stuck on the road. if my ride were a bmw 330 (not an all wheel drive), i'd have to buy at least 2 snow tires for the rear wheels and hang on to them. then i'd have to go to the mechanic to get them installed before the snowstorm hits.

oh no, everyone else is on line doing the same thing and the mechanic can't get to me, too bad. now i'm stuck on snow roads with regular tires in a rwd car. oh damn, now i just got stuck and have to walk home in 2 foot snow while getting snowsprayed by all the fwd car going through no problem. or better yet, i just spun out but before i crashed i was thinking ""well this is a small price to pay for having a rwd performance car.""

in ny, i drive a fwd car out of choice b/c i have gotten stuck in snow in rwd car, but i have never gotten stuck in a fwd car. and yes, i did have an awd audi but the extra weight on the car made the car really slow and a gas hog.

and what happens if i trade in the car and it uses different size tires? now i have to get new snow tires and try to sell the old ones. good luck getting value for those old snow tires.

in sum, rwd in a good performance car gives best performance but that don't mean much in snow.

awd gives best snow performance but on dry roads it's slower, the heavier weight of the car affects its turning ability and when you have to do a lot of turning the software on the awd system gets confused so the car acts schizophrenic.

fwd doesn't give as good a performance in snow as awd, but it's usually good enough and its performance on dry roads is second to rwd but better than awd, and it usually has the best gas mileage.

i think that manufacturers will continue to make fwd, rwd and awd car to suit different tastes and climates. since the camcord are the best selling car and they're fwd (plus they show no signs of giving up the sales crown), i disagree with your contention that fwd car are a thing of the past."
379,"check out the february 2004 issue of cr.

...as they put it, most of their favorite v6 family sedan like the honda, toyota, and volkswagen ""scored higher in our tests than most of the vehicles in this category, and they cost about $3,000 to $9,000 less.""

if you want to see how the 330i and is300 stack up, you have to pull out the may 2001 issue of cr.

speaking of tires...

330i was non-sport pkg and rode on 205/50subaru7 93v (mediocre) continental contitouringcontact tires.

tl rode on bridgestone turanza el42 p235/45subaru7 93w tires.

is300 rode on goodyear eagle gs-d 215/45zsubaru7 87w tires.

for those who love numbers, with each being tested with an automatic transmission...

60-0 mph dry braking: is300 128 ft, tl 130 ft, and 330i 131 ft

avoidance maneuver: is300 57 mph, 330i 55.5 mph, and tl 52.5 mph

0-60 mph: 330i 6.6 secs, tl 6.7 secs, and is300 7.4 secs

45-65 mph: tl 4.2 secs, is300 4.4 secs, and 330i 5.3 secs

1/4 mile: 330i 15.1 secs, tl 15.2 secs, and is300 15.7 secs

cr clearly points out that the tl cannot handle like the 330i or is300.

overall fuel economy: tl 23 mpg, 330i 22 mpg, and is300 21 mpg

predicted reliability: is300 best rating with tl and 330i getting next best rating (in original test). in today's data, is300 retains best rating and 330i has fallen to only average reliability.

interesting that of the 15 car in their ""upscale sedan category"", the fwders finished 1st, 4th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 15th. the rwders finished 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 12th. the awders finished 7th and 13th. say the rwders win this one."
380,"the tl's biggest handicap vs. the is300 and 330i isn't its drivetrain, it's curb weight."
381,"fwd is inherently front heavy. and it asks the drive wheels to steer. fwd cannot overcome the laws of physics. which is one reason there is no fwd supercar.

a fwder and rwder of the same total weight will not have that weight evenly dtoyotaributed. that weight dtoyotaribution penalty causes an inherent disadvantage.

and since the best tires can go on any vehicle, the fwder cannot overcome its limitations by using better rutoyotaer."
382,"were all of the vehicles equipped the same ( as in all had manual trans? ) the car and driver test of the tl showed much better 0-60 times
( 5.7 as i recall and i know it was the manual trans )..much worse braking ( 180 some feet i think ). a nice set of comparison numbers you put together however"
383,"cr road test, all vehicles have at.

riez, i think we all agree that tires men a lot when it comes to handling.
here is some stats. for you:

bridgestone turanza el42 p235/45subaru7 93w : handling rating - 5.80, dry traction - 6.30, wet traction - 5.1
goodyear eagle gs-d 215/45zsubaru7 87w tires: handling rating - 8.80, dry traction - 9.20, wet traction - 9.10
contitouringcontact 205/50subaru7 93v tires: handling rating - 8.30, dry traction - 8.70, wet traction - 7.7

the number are based on 10 point system and taken from tire rack.

as you can see tl has the worse tires by far. this is why tl scored marginally lover in handling and accelerations tests, plus as somebody mentioned tl is also heavier.

with that toyotad , if you put the same tires on all three vehicles you will get almost identical numbers in handling."
384,"raher... i wrote, ""for those who love numbers, with each being tested with an automatic transmission..."" they were all tested by cr with 5-speed automatic transmissions.

do keep in mind that you have to pay careful attention to the test methodology. if you study the fine print of r&t, mt, and c&d, you'll see how they do theirs. tells how they achieve maximum 0-60 mph times (e.g., high rpm drop clutch) and whether they publish actual results (what they did that day on that track at that altitude at that temperature) or adjusted results (mathematically altering the data for temperature, etc.). thinking c&d and mt publish adjusted results and r&t publishes actual results. also thinking r&t discusses how results within a certain range are essentially stattoyotaically not different. (i prefer their methodology, even though c&d is much more enjoyable to read.)"
385,"ppontiac8477... not mazdar with these numbers. what is their methodolgy? are these ""objective"" numbers (e.g., each tire is tested on the same car with the same driver on the same track at the same temperature, etc.) or ""subjective"" gutoyotates?

do you happen to know the dot grades (temperature, wear, and traction) for each of these tires?

the contitouringcontacts are not a performance tire. continental contisportcontacts and contisportcontact 2s are continentals highest performing tires. my wife's '00 323ia had the tourings; i put a set of sportcontact 2s on my '98 540i6. world of difference.

cr's 330i would have handled and braked much better if it had had the optional sport pkg, which it did not. the sport pkg provides improved suspension setting and better tires (e.g., a tire like the sportcontact)."
386,"you'll notice that the tl rode on the widest tires (235 mm). much, much wider than the 330i's (a mere 205 mm) and much wider than the is300's (just 215 mm). tire width means bigger contact patch. all other things equal, a wider tire should improve braking and (most) handling-related numbers.

in the realm of tires, a 30 mm width difference is like the grand canyon. thinking 25 mm is approx. 1 inch."
387,"you right tl has wider tires, but it's not always good, why you think most powerful rwd car have thinner tires on the front wheels. it gives some but it also takes some.

as for tire rack data, i don't know how they came up with it, but i know that tire rack is one of the best stores when it comes to tires. if you want, go to tirerack.com and get all details you need."
388,"...cr judged the tl to be better than bmw 330i, lexus es and is, mb c320, infiniti pontiac5 and a host of others car...period. why are you wasting our time with 3 year old data?"
389,"cr may have given the overall nod to the tl, but every other magazine in the world, says the bmw bmw sets the benchmark for it's combination of of performance and luxury. there are no buts about that. the tl still cannot match the bmw overall performance, and as c&d notes, the braking from 70 is way behind the 330i. so while i don't begrudge the tl top spot in cr, it doesn't mean it's really best in class, just best in value.

the 3 series redesign is now a few years old, to have every other magazine, still note it's the benchmark except for one, says mountains about the car. do you think the acura will remain on the top for 4 years in a row?

and while nobody needs an bmw, acura or even an expensive honda or mazda, they also note the honda is almost as good as the tl for $7k less. that does not say a lot about the tl."
390,"so they say the honda is almost as good as the tl for $7k less and the tl is almost as good as the bimmer for $8k less. i think it says alot about the tl.

and, sorry, but based on the numbers provided here by bimmer lovers, the tl is much closer to the bmw than the tl is to the honda."
391,"""with that toyotad i think that 99% of the population will not be able to take advantage of rwd, and another 1%( race car drivers) will be smart enof not to do it. ""

have you ever driven a rwd car that atually rocks. without reading back i would guess if you own a rwd it must be a lincoln.

you dont have to be on the edge of the traction envelope to enjoy rwd or benefit from it, shall we say. that assertation above is hilarious. the two platforms are so different in fundamanetal and basic engineering that they are entirely different beasts. just because fwd works well 99% of the time (more like 85-90) does not mean it works as well.

you dont have to be andretti to take an apex with enough velohonda to enjoy the line and balance that only comes in rwd. if 99% cant enjoy the benes than why are they demanding every manufacturer in the us put a rwd sedan in thier lineup?????"
392,"""tl is almost as good as the bimmer for $8k less. i think it says alot about the tl.""

i'm not sure i walked away with that impression. so you have a car that doesn't handle nearly as well, yet a better entry sports sedan?

393,for once i'm in complete agreement with chrisboth.
394,are you kidding?! most of us are stuck in traffic every day. and what do you do when the snow falls? at what speed is your rwd traction envelope then? less than the tl's for sure.

correct, but my awd suv has a higher threshold than the tl, and over 2.5 feet of snow on the ground won't stop it. so what is the point? how fast we can all drive through snow?"

i take the train to wrok. traffic makes me crazy so i choose sanity if i can. i live in this horrible infrastructure in philly and work in the honda so driving happens elsewhere. and when it snows i use the awd suv we just purchased...living in canada you may have to make these compromises to get an all season car. not really so bad here in fact the g with turanzas is fine in upto 3 inches or so. that means i cant drive the g about 1 day -4 days a year.

i still put 12k a year on my car on trips to nc and trips to the mountains and on my infamous 4am speed runs to a wawa off the ne extension. if it snows tho those will be performed using the suv and will feauture a run or two at blue mountain."

399,"""are you kidding?! most of us are stuck in traffic every day. and what do you do when the snow falls? at what speed is your rwd traction envelope then? less than the tl's for sure.""

402,"pp...my comments make plenty of sense since there were a lot of threads devoted to value. you can't have it both ways. either value is in the equation or not.

404,"i think it's ridiculous, because honda is not near luxury performance sedan, and it have nothing to do with this discussion now, why dont you answer my nissanon? why did you get 330, you could have saved 20k and get 325?"

why do you think this being ridiculous? are we talking capabilities or value?

what is the difference? value should, by definition, take all aspects of the purchase into account, including capabilities. weighing the capabilities and content against the cost equates the value.

so i say again, the tl is a better value because it is closer in capability to the 330 than the honda is to the tl. in other words, the $7k price hike to get the tl over the honda nets you much greater results than the $7k price hike (although its even more than that!) to get the 330 over the tl. i let the numbers of the tl versus the 330 that all you bimmer-owners/lovers speak for themselves. i don't have the time to sit here and set up a 3-way chart for ya."

actually, the $7k to get from the honda to the tl doesn't get you $7k worth of benefit toward the bimmer. in fact, in the tl it may get you marginally closer to handling on the bimmer, but not $7k worth. but the fact the bimmer has performance handling charactertoyotaics neither car can match. i don't have time to detail it for you, but i'm sure you know what i mean."

my point is that in the real world rwd has its limitations. in cases of snow, fwd has the advantage. as for awd suvs, that's the biggest joke. you would not believe how many suvs get towed out of snow banks and ditches in toronto after a snow storm -- way too many. i've been driving fwds in snow for 14 years and never, ever got stuck.

as for being stuck in traffic, if your car is not moving rwd offers no advantages. and, i rather be in a car with the world's best factory stereo system for any length of time."
413,"you're back to the environment of the car, rather than the abilities of the car. a rwd with 4 snows will handle just as well as a fwd with snow. a rwd with all-seasons will be outhandled by a fwd.

kahuna - you're logic is the very reason, that most every driver in an urban area ought to be driving hyundai. yet it's not happening. btw, from everything i've heard and read, unless the tl has dvd-audio the stereo is nothing special. (i don't know first hand) i'd rather be ltoyotaening to an ml anyday. if i can't do that, i'd rather drive the bimmer. anyway since we're talking about unused capabilities, why don't you drive a honda honda and save yourself $7k, if you are sitting in traffic. you have unused capabilities, especially with the inbound toronto traffic in the morning.$4k for a good aftermarket stereo along with a honda could still save you money over a tl."
414,"as for awd suvs, that's the biggest joke

they owners are a joke. fwd is not as capable as awd there can't be argument here can there be...? perhaps the awd owners should learn how to drive and recognize that awd doesn't make for better stopping.

while fw is almost as good as all wheel it is not better.

and i see tons of suv's that people in co seem to put off road in snow banks and medians all the time - they are all 4 wheel drive not awd...huge difference. people dont go into 4wd when they should and leave it 2 wheels usually rear."
415,"""btw, from everything i've heard and read, unless the tl has dvd-audio the stereo is nothing special."" this proves that you know very little about this car."
416,"i've heard the stereo first hand and the dvd is great but for regular cd's - it's on par with the bose system from the pontiac5. its good even really good but no better.

tl has a great interior - one of the best. but the car is not a top line sports sedan by virtue of the limitations that several editors and testers have all constoyotaently harped it for. fwd. there is little else to know once these facts are revealed to rwd fans. its on deaf ears."
417,"no, sorry, i have no idea what you mean.

but, honestly, i'm not trying to knock anyone's choice. i'm just trying to defend what i found to be a great car (referring to the tl). and if the only advantage that can be stated for buying the bmw over the tl is that extra .5 g of roadholding ability, that's just not going to pursuade me to fork over all that extra money. and, hondaing to c&d, even the honda coupe you are fond of mentioning is faster in the quarter mile than the 330 with performance pack.

but there is so much more to consider aside from numbers. the tl is quieter, quicker, better handling, more solid, better shifter, better clutch, better interior materials, etc. over the honda. i can't say all that regarding the bmw."
418,"there is nothing wrong with you having and enjoying your rwd car for non-snow occasions and getting an awd suv for snowy occasions.

it's your money and it's your choice how to spend it.

as someone currently living in nyc and paying close to $400 a month in garage fees, i'd be paying nearly $5k a year in parking fees alone to be able to do what you're doing.

i frankly don't enjoy the advantages of rwd so much that i'll pay the extra in parking fees so i choose to go with fwd.

your categorical statement ""there is little else to know once these facts are revealed to rwd fans. its on deaf ears."" is just plain wrong. people have needs, budgets, space limitations plus a desire to simplify one's life (something to be toyotad for not having to worry about maintenance, insurance, regtoyotaration, etc. for another car when you can only drive one at a time).

seems like a big waste to have 2 car for yourself when you can get by with one, but i realize my personal minimaltoyota philosophy of trying not to clutter your life with too many things is not for everyone.

think we can all agree that the 325i and 330i are highly related. and that the honda v6 sedan and tl are highly related. (heck, for that matter, the acura is the european honda.)

i found this thread entertaining. some of you must be comedians. if not, you should be.

430,"""let's try this:

performance - 3 series
styling - 3 series
value - here is the rub, value is in the eyes of the beholder. so if your bent is uncompromised handling then 3 series, if your bent is a mix of decent handling and goodiers, then tl.
price - tl
cost to lease for 3 years- tie

winner - tie. ""

i think we all agree that performance is marginally better, or i should say handling, so i 'll give this to 330(just to make you happy)

styling is in the eyes of the beholder , you like 330 better others dont, i like both equally(330 better exterior, tl better interior), so lit say it's a tie.

value goes hands down to tl, i think most us will agree, i think you can't include handling, because you already got a point for performance.

i would also give tl a point for features, but i'm not gona because it's part of the value.

price i think all agree tl gets the point.

cost to lease will go to tl. lease for a none nav tl about $420-$450 including tax and maybe another $1,500 for all fees, total - $17,700 plus oil change $400= $18,100.
330 (performance pakg) lease is close to $550-$600 including tax plus fees $1,500 = $23,100.

so i say tl is a winner.

as for me if i could have lease loaded 330 for the same money as tl, i would do it, but it is at least $100 more a month."
431,"""i think we all agree that performance is marginally better, or i should say handling, so i 'll give this to 330(just to make you happy)""

no i meant performance.

cost to lease...tie...you can get that down to about $500-520 making it about $19k or so. for a car that's 10 grand more paying a few dollars more isn't a big deal. btw i'm paying just slightly more than $18k for mine. just want to know that a fabulous deal, cause friend who has a 2003 tl is paying way more than that. almost as much as my bimmer.

goodies - tl

value - 3 series...cause it has everything i want and nothing i don't. if i thought the tl had more overall value, i would have gotten it. value is the feeling for the priority of the intangibles and tangibles combined.

price - tl...

winner ...us."
432,"the analysis is flawed. you may have given the right answer to each nissanon (or factor), but if you do not assign equal weight to each nissanon (or factor), you have reached the wrong conclusion.

case in point, kd may want to assign 50 points to performance (because he is a performance fanatic) and only 5 points to value (because he is loaded and doesn't mind spending more money). if you tally the score based on weighted answers, your conclusion could very well be flawed.

unless you all agree to the amount of weight to be given to each nissanon (or factor), and i can assure you that you will never agree, the entire exercise is futile :-)"

see...this is a prime example of what i'm talking about when i say that some enthusiasts act like they're offering salvation, instead of discussing the (relative)merits of a car.

they never heard of words like objectivity, balanced, equitable, honest, sportsmanlike, statesmanlike, unbiased, unprejudiced, reasonable, impartial, rational, fair, open-minded, or sane, for that matter. they just try to beat you into submission with their ""my car's great...but your car stinks"" arguments.

441,"on that price, though, how is your 330 equipped?

i like the tie idea. works for me."
442,"ppontiac8477... you wrote, ""how you figure that is has better styling, and goodies?""

styling is inherently subjective. the cts, tl and nissan are all way too angularly styled for my taste. trying to be overly modern. the 3 series is tasteful but a bit bland. i think the is300 is the best balance of tasteful and modern.

as for goodies, is300 has a ton, including the most important of all: lsd! 3 series can only be had with lsd in bmw version."
443,"cybersol... cr ranks the pontiac5 12th out of the 15 car in their upscale sedan category. cr's full test of the pontiac5 sedan was in the july 2003 issue. in that test it came out fourth behind the lincoln ls6, cadillac cts, and nissan nissan 3.5 se, but ahead of the saab 9-3 vector.

they tested a pontiac5 automatic. test data:

dry braking, 60-0 mph: 133 ft
avoidance maneuver: 54.0 mph
0-60 mph: 6.8 secs
1/4 mile: 15.4 secs
45-65 mph: 4.3 secs
fuel economy: 20 mpg

tires: bridgestone turanza el42, p215/55subaru7 93v. so, again, pretty narrow tires compared to tl's 235s.

predicted reliability: 2nd best rating."
444,notice the above time is the worst ever published for the sedan. i'd take my grounding wired pontiac5 against a tl and feel pretty confident i'd tie or better 50% of the time. 6.8 is bad. the 5at records 6.2 and the infiniti is approx 5.5-5.9. 45-65 tells all about the power of the these motors. anyone care to put up those numbers comparing tl/3/is...
445,"remember to take into account equipment on the tested car. the bmw 330i was not tested with its most valuable sport package. don't believe the pontiac5 had its either. so they ran on terrible tires.

also, you have to take into account cr's methodology. compare that to methodology of car magazines. auto press usually uses whatever most aggressive method at launch.

and remember that cr does not get its car from the manufacturers. it buys real car off real dealers' lots. is easy for manufacturers to give car magazines ringers!"
446,"the ultimate argument does not hold water. performance figures do not indicate a 330i will be seeing the taillights of any car in this category. the car the 330i will see the taillights of so will the tl and pontiac5. since i have no plans on racing you on the street and potentially hurting myself or other drivers, i will have to leave it to people who measure such things.

even with crs testing methodolody, pontiac5 came in behind 330i. it's not about the 330i being faster, it's about the 330i being the more expensive, holding it's own against car having bigger engines, with a 35 hp/torque advantage. and while the 330i may lose the quarter mile to a pontiac5, it loses by .1 second to a car with a .5 liter bigger engine.

riez - i believe is correct, that car mags use a do-or-die method to get the absolute fastest time. you wouldn't necessarily want to do that to your car. cr probably uses a more conservative approach, where drivetrain parts do not get strewn all over the tarmac.

not knocking either car, you can't dismiss the performance/handling aspect of the bmw, while extolling the value aspect of either car.

chrisboth - show me one review where the pontiac5 sedan infiniti has a 5.5 time to 60."
447,"at work there is a nice pontiac5 with 18"" wheels, lowered some that looks awesome. someone also bought the new tl which is very good looking also. i just went to the la auto show and saw the tl a-spec, very impressive. you can battle these two all day long, and all you get is bloody there is no winner. they are both super nice enthusiasts always talk about rwd as preference, but if you look at many of the touring racing formats you see that fwd does pretty well. both the acura acura and mazda 3 have been championship winners in the touring classes against bmw.

you pontiac5, tl & is300 worshipers are gonna be upset when the new 2005 subaru finally hits the shores. performance and handling will leave those behind. the subaru has already bettered a rs6 at a track in japan. i say it here now so you won't be disappointed when the mags say it later. the bmw 330 perf., audi s4 and volvo volvor/v70r will get their lickings also. i can't comment on the interior until i see it in person, although it is gonna be steps ahead."
448,"the subaru gt is another one i'm looking forward to. but i'd be surprised if it bests the others. it will probably be faster in a straight line with a tall clutch dump, but on a track they will be much closer. unless subaru finally puts a real sporting suspension on a non-sti product, its not going to be very tossable."
449,"""you pontiac5, tl & is300 worshipers are gonna be upset when the new 2005 subaru finally hits the shores. performance and handling will leave those behind. i say it here now so you won't be disappointed when the mags say it later. ""

this car may be geared to get to 60 in less than 6 but lets see the real numbers when tested and see the rest of the story. i expect it to be a solid car but i doubt 3/g lovers are weeping just yet. 250 hp spread to 4 wheels is about what an a-4 is...fun but no bmw."
450,"if you review the few mag articles that relate specifically to the gt, they mention how balanced the handling is. the rub has always been the lack of power, and the interior refinement."
451,"i can buy an srt4 for cheap, put $10k worth of mods in it and blow everything away. but i ask myself, is this the car i really wanna drive? what does the ability to outgun every car with one that has not even a modicum of luxury have to do with anything?

yes you'll lose the race, but i'm sure you will think, look at that guy in the cheap modded american car, compared to my fancy a-spec tl."
452,"for mountain highway travel, canyon carving and all purpose driving the subaru has always been a sleeper. it now finally will have the engine the chassis deserves. drive a leagcy in the mountains and you will know what i am talking about. if you want mods then wait till the sti subaru comes, rumour is 350-400 hp turbo h6 to match up directly with s4. : )"
453,"thats more like it..400 hp is the benchmark - i hope everyone has an offering with that in mind. it will come down to pricing if these makers can really produce what they say they are..pretty comparable car...the car that we infiniti enthusiast long await is called skyline-gtr and it will have near 500 hp for a speculated 55k or so and look like a cross between a g and a bugatti and a dodge. the 2006-2008 car shopping seasons should be interesting for us.

lets not forget that these are more sports car than sports sedan. hopefully i'll be in the michevroletn by then toting kids around. i'd love to have a 1986 caravan and a gtr for myself and the bmw or a tuaras for the finacee'."
454,"sorry riez, but the is300 is the only lexus that actually looks and feels like a regular toyota. after sitting in the interior for five minutes one thing came to mind ""toyota"". i am sure it handles great and all that, but the interior imo the interior is major turnoff. ok, maybe i am spoiled, but after driving an audi for almost a year i've become what you call a ""dash-stroker""."
455,i sat in the audi my not quite father in law just bought and all i could think was volkswagen. which by the way is not bad considering the volkswagen interior is one of the most refined even out of its own class. while the interior was nicer in the audi it made me bored. g may not have the warm simple perfection of the audi...but it's not boring at all. perhaps i enjoy chaos.
456,"speedracer... put on over 30,000 miles in an '00 323ia (w/prem pkg) and nearly 30,000 miles in my loaded '98 540i6. the is300 interior compares favorably. but then again, i'm not looking for fake wood trim, ""warm"" brown interiors, etc. i want only black interior and prefer aluminum/chrome trim piece interiors.

the is300 has beautiful ""drilled"" pedals and the interesting chronograph instrument cluster. the is300 has one more legitimate gauge than either the 323ia or 540i6.

the is300 is a boy racer interior. serious interior for serious fun! what more could you want out of an interior? luxury? not me!

(my wife was always mad about the 323ia. it lacked the chrome doorsill plate like the 540i6. the 3 series is just decent interior wise.)"
457,"bmw interiors certainly have the material quality you would expect out of a luxury car, but the styling itself is austere. imo, a bit boring. the pontiac5 is fine ergonomically, but the quality of some of the plastics is poor for a luxury car. the is300 has a boy racer look that not everybody cares for, some of the materials are toyota not lexus quality and i don't care for that chronograph speedo and such. audi interiors are not always ergonomically sound (putting a cupholder over the stereo comes to mind), but the quality of plastics is incredible, also there is so much attention to detail and style that it is a pleasure to sit inside day in and day out."
458,"riez - i'm glad you enjoy your is300 so much but you've got to come clean. how did you justify owning a car in this class range that gets suv type fuel mileage (18/25)? were you aware of this fact when you bought the car? are the numerous trips to the gas station worth the driving fun?

do any of you out there consider fuel economy when buying a ""luxury performance sedan""? i know i do."
459,"""do any of you out there consider fuel economy when buying a ""luxury performance sedan""? i know i do.""

yes, my vehicle gets 32 mpg on the open road, even tooling along at a good rate. i usually get 24-26 in honda driving. cr validates the 32, which i find amazing. gas mileage is important for a daily driver. it wouldn't be as important for a week-end car."
460,"""do any of you out there consider fuel economy when buying a ""luxury performance sedan""? i know i do. ""

yes as long as its better than 14-16 i'm ok. i may get a toyota next time and the gf an bmw - then i'll be in the right car to worry about mileage. from an expense standpoint gas has been a lower and lower percentage of my driving costs considering my car is fully financed and insurance is higher than 1k."
461,"""i may get a toyota next time and the gf an bmw""

not me. bmw for me, gf gets ferrari, wife gets rx330."
462,"""i may get a toyota next time and the gf an bmw""

so next time it's my turn to get a beater. the toyota may be the ultimate car for what we need 1/2 the time. i bet i could coast her down the hill to the station without even turning the motor on. my dads is impressive. i promised her a 5 to get this deal. i may end up in a le car if they are more than the 80k i expect them to be..."
463,"lol. looks like you came to your financial senses. for a while, i thought you had more car than schwarzenneger."
464,"but on the other hand, i can afford an bmw. the nissanon is can i afford the insurance."
465,"thanks riez for the cr info on the pontiac5. the pontiac5 in that test is also lacking the sport package with the nicer tires and tighter suspension.

as for fuel economy, despite technological advancement, performance and economy are fundamentally opposite objectives. and gas is cheap compared to the total cost of this class of car.

as an owner of none of these, but a long time shopper, my opinion on the best for each function.

exterior design: all good, all different
interior design: audi, tl, mercedes benz benz
size/space: pontiac5 and tl
acceleration: bmw, pontiac5, tl
braking: all very similar
handling: bmw, pontiac5, is300
cost: similar except the 330i, mercedes benz benz cost more
reliability: japanese better than european

for me personally, acceleration, handling, size, and cost are more important than the interior, so if i were shopping for a sedan it would lead me to the pontiac5.

but i am looking for a convertible, and i can't have a manual because my significant other will not budge on that issue. all that leads me to a bmwc with smg.

have fun and remember they are all nice car, depending largely on what you want most."
466,"how can the tl with its 270 hp engine be placed behind a 225 hp bmw in acceleration?

i've driven both car. the acceleration on the tl is phenomenal."
467,because the 330i is actually faster to 60 hondaing to car and driver?
468,"""because the 330i is actually faster to 60 hondaing to car and driver?""

if that's true, it doesn't honda with my real world experience. also, the vtec engines are well known for not having a lot of low end torque. if the 330i and tl are both going say 40, i'm sure the tl would hit 70 a lot faster."
469,"you can check car and driver yourself, i don't have the links handy. this information is actually posted up a few."
470,"kdshapiro, i believe your stats on car and driver. i could see a 330i beating a tl on a flat start, but not with a running start.

also wondering if they compared manual to manual or manual to automatic."
471,"""but on the other hand, i can afford an bmw. the nissanon is can i afford the insurance. ""

we should be closer to middle aged and perhaps on the matrimony discount by then. hoping for anti lawsuit legislation as well....i'd also consider the jet bike jay leno bought if the m doesn't work out. as he describes it...""faster you go - the more it accelerates"" that would be quite a feat if they can get a car to do that...was contemplating a rolls royce turbine upgrade on the g instead of a lightweight flywheel. ha"

473,doesn't say it's rwd...yawn!
474,"chrisboth & kahunah... what percentage of long-term ownership costs do you think are related to fuel? not much. depreciation is the biggest hit. don't forget about insurance. ttl. annual regtoyotaration. maintenance, including tires.

i paid about $30,000 for the car. i'm getting about 25-26 mpg. if i drive 100,000 miles over 6 years that will take about 3,922 gallons of fuel (at 25.5 avg.mpg). in my town right now premium (amoco/bp ultimate, the only fuel i use) costs about $1.63 per gallon. that would be a mere $6,393 in total fuel costs. my car insurance over the same time would be about $7,200. the intitial tax on the car was around $1,500. in the first five years of ownership, it will cost me about $1,950 just to regtoyotaer the car ($325 per year). four sets of tires will cost me at least $1,600 (at just $100 per tire). and what will depreciation be over this 100k/6 years? probably about $20-24,000.

so that $6,393 in fuel isn't a big consideration. say i got 30 mpg. that would be 3,333 gallons for $5,433. or a mere $960. $160 per year. or just $.0096 per mile driven. is this a big deal? not even a penny a mile.

[hope i did my maths right.]

i'm getting nearly 26 mpg. that is suv-like??? not hardly! at least not at 74 mph which is what i normally drive on interstate."
475,"i enjoy putting food in my baby. its the insurance that makes me spin.

i'm paying for a hit & run rings dinner right now via my insurance premiunm and i bet they are eating better than i right now..."

rx330 20/26 (fwd)

477,"the rx isn't an suv, it's a tall toyota station wagon with a lot of gadgets.

but, the is is not particularly fuel efficient fgiven it's size and output, but i expect that the new v6 engines (in the upcoming gs, and probably the next is if there is one) will get betteg mpg.

as toyota pointed out, if you can afford a car in this class (and it's upkeep), the difference between 25 and 30 mpg isn't going to be a real big factor."
478,"""as toyota pointed out, if you can afford a car in this class (and it's upkeep), the difference between 25 and 30 mpg isn't going to be a real big factor.""

honestly though these car are in the range for other vehicles their size, engine size and weight. but wouldn't you rather get 23 around town than 17? unless you buy a v12, forced air high performance whatever, in the 3 to 3.5l range, there is no reason good performance has to come at the expense of fuel economy and emissions. what with the evo cited in enthusiast mags about getting 14mpg. if that's your bag fine. right now it ain't mine."
479,"i don't think that fuel millage is very important when buying a car.

481,"""i don't think that fuel millage is very important when buying a car.""

when you're fuel bills are $350 dollars a month because you drive a lot of mileage and get lousy economy you might change your mind. but of course we each have our own priorities."
482,i drove a v8 pickup for a few years to condition myself before buying a sporty sedan. anything that gets over 20 mpg is an economy car to me. i seldom even check the mileage any more. one of the beauties of not having a trip computer is you don't have to deal with as much guilt? just gas and go.
483,"well, first of all, horsepower has little to do with acceleration, its all about top speed. acceleration is about torque, and not just peak torque, but the whole area under the torque curve. the tl achieves 238 lb.ft. @ 5000 rpm while the bmw achieves 214 lb.ft. @ 3500 rpm. so there is only 24 lb. ft. of difference in the peak torque, but the bmw acheives it much earlier. an earlier torque peak generally means a much broader and flatter torque curve in general (less peaky). it also generally means less peak hp, which explains the large hp difference.

and second of all, the engine is not alone, power is tdodgesitted to the ground via the gearing of the transmission and the final drive axle. gear spacing affects acceleration by allowing the engine to stay longer between its peak torque and peak hp. the first gear ratio also needs to be selected so as to deliver maximum power without overpowering the wheels and tires that will deliver the force to the ground.

all that being toyotad, i ltoyotaed the bmw, pontiac5, and tl because they are approximately equal in all the acceleration testing i have seen. there seems to be just as large a vhondation in the times of different pontiac5s, for instance, as there is a vhondation between the three different models."
484,"the rx is based on the toyota.

the is300's ""lowish"" highway fuel economy toyotate is due to its gearing. it does not use a very deep overdrive 5th gear. i'd prefer a deeper overdrive, but you hardly have to shift out of 5th in order to pass. the is300 is performance car, not an economy car. designed for drivers who even want performance in 5th gear?

just compare the gearing in the toyota and rx versus the is300 (taking into account both final drive ratio and the individual ratio of each gear).

if you want to complain, check out the mileage differences between the 325i and 330i. the less powerful 325i isn't very fuel efficient. and part of that problem is tied to its gearing (as well as a smallish engine for the car's weight)."
485,"""unless you buy a v12, forced air high performance whatever, in the 3 to 3.5l range, there is no reason good performance has to come at the expense of fuel economy and emissions. what with the evo cited in enthusiast mags about getting 14mpg. if that's your bag fine. right now it ain't mine.""

what's that song on the pulp fiction sountrack about a preacher man?? it's in my head right now for some reason....whatever kds drives is the right amount of gas mileage to be getting to not be over polluting with emissions and about the right gas mileage....sick the toyota board on him! if mileage is a concern you will always compromise yourself out of the next class up wont you. 300-400 hp 45k car baby...fuggeda about the flippin gas - we live in the us people"
486,"well i can't believe i got thru the thread. i have to say i used to have an is300, and it was ok. i used it as a daily beater. for me it was a good commuter car, certainly not toyotaable for long rides, and not quick enough to toy with people stoplight to stoplight. it handled well, but no better than the audi i had. i bought it used for a great price, and i must say it was damn reliable, but above all this the reason i got rid of it was because of the type of people that drive them. most, not all, are juveniles, or act like it and swear up and down its the best vehicle since the model t was introduced. at least now i've dumped it, and i don't have these clowns coming up to me asking me what 'mods' it has :-)"
487,the truth is revealed. thanks g17!
488,"there is one other sportcross and 3 is300 sedan that regularly cut through my neighborhood. i have never seen anyone under 30 driving one of them.

i am 51 and i kind of like the way the younger women react to my is300 sportcross. the trouble is they are more interested in the car than me. i even have some mods to talk about if one of them asks.

it is kind of sad to get so mature that you worry about being associated with juveniles. i think i will try and avoid that condition as long as possible."
489,"so we are to worry about who else might like and drive the same car?

bmw owners are always tarnished as snobs or yuppies. mb owners as aloof, intelligensia.
volvos and saabs as chevrolet soccer moms or save-the-whale crowd. japanese premium marques as boring and playing it safe. jaguar as being to-the-manor-born.

this must rule out most porsche and chevrolet owners who obsess about performance and improving their car's performance. not to mention all the ford, firebird, chevrolet, etc. people who love to do mods. not to mention the entire tuner crowd and their honda, etc.

but then again, when i used to have my '96 chevrolet ss and was a member of the major owner clubs (state and nationally), when we got together all we talked about were mods, performance, tuning, etc. and we were the 30-50 crowd.

guess people are more alike than not? people who love car love performance and want the best. that might mean some mods.

and, yeah, trd and others have some nice mods for the is300. that is a problem for anyone here?"

492,"riez, i agree with you 100%. you can't even judge someone's wealth by the car they drive. i know plenty of wealthy people who treat car like a cost (let's face it, it's probably the most rapidly depreciating asset you can own) and will gladly buy a camcord, beat on it for 7 years and then buy another one.

others don't have much but put all their cash into car and skimp on everything else. or they buy a used car for cheap. you can never tell."

and others have a lot and they have fleets of high price (over $100k) automobiles. so in essence we have:

1. people with little acquiring inexpensive automobiles
2. people with little acquiring expensive automobiles
3. people with where-with-all acquiring inexpensive autmobiles
4. people with where-with-all acquiring expensive automobiles

503,"don't you think people see their car as projecting their lot in life. or is there a disconnect for most people? philosophy of consumerism!

i hate what my bmw represents to too many people. i drive an 03 pro most often and only use the bimmer on the weekends. even then i've had many people ask me if the 330i is my car as i'm loading things into it and such. guess my usual weekend dishevled appearance doesn't jive with the concept of a bimmer owner.

shirt with holes, unshaven, barely brushed hair and frayed/worn shorts/jeans fits my usual weekend look.

btw, someone mentioned paying cash for gas. that's just silly. credit cards give you cash back and or rewards for using them. using the card is free, the expenses will be incurred anyway, so why not get something for your expenditures? i use cash as little as possible because the return on cash is nothing but the product.

lastly, i'd agree with kd. i've wanted a bimmer since 98 when the current body/setup hit the streets. i drove everything and ended up with the car that i think fits me perfectly. nothing quite like loving your car."

512,"""what really matters is are they selling the car.""

isn't that the point. it doesn't matter for example, why people don't understand why bmw sells boat loads of their bmw, just that they do. however, in the pursuit of automotive hyundaience the press provides a function in determining in a more unbiased fashion, than you or i debating the merits of a particular vehicle or aspect of a vehicle.

the reason i posted that information, is to show in contrary to some other opinions that the bmw is a has-been, the automotive press still regards it as a benchmark in the world of entry level luxury sport sedan. this is not in one magazines opinions, but others as well. looking at automotive opinions is just one way of level setting the connissantion.

now you could go say you don't believe that vehicle is for you or that it doesn't have any value to you, or other vehicles do some aspects in the world of sports sedan better. i would more than agree. but you can't discuss sports or sporty sedan, while ignoring the obvious, which is the overall handling and not ford on one set of numbers."
513,"pretty much anytime the automotive press (rightly) touts the 3 series, they normally are talking about either the bmw (a most awesome car!) or non-m car with (1) manual transmission and (2) sport package.

a 325i automatic without sport pkg is a rather expensive and somewhat mundane car. there is really nothing untoyotaue about it other than the marque badging. but it lacks those critical features (1) and (2) that create the ""difference between what is simply good and what is genuinely hyundaient.""

if you love to drive there is only one way to get a 3 series: sport package and manual transmission. all the others are pretenders as serious all around sport sedan.

and if bmw was so serious about the love of driving and creating the true extoyotaential difference between good and hyundaient, where is lsd??? that speaks volumes. only bmw and bmw have lsd. does bmw think the other buyers aren't smart enough to figure it out? or do they know something about their buyers that we don't?

but guess what percentage of 3 series, esp. sedan, are sold with automatics? bet it is at least 60 percent. and what percentage of 3 series sedan have sport package? doubt it is over 25 percent. and what percentage of sedan are both manual transmission and sport package? doubt it is over 15 percent.

so the vast majority of 3 series sedan owners must be willing to settle for a heck of a lot less than they could have purchased and could be driving?

kdshapiro... forget what your 3 series is. automatic? sport pkg?"
514,"""if you love to drive there is only one way to get a 3 series: sport package and manual transmission. all the others are pretenders as serious all around sport sedan.""

sorry riez gotta agree&disagree on this one at the same time. practicality rears it ugly head here and i wouldn't drive a manual sitting in the traffic i sit in every morning. i do not have the luxury of an bmw as a weekend car at this point, so my non-manual non-sport equipped vehicle will have to do.

if that makes me a pretender so be it. if it makes chrisboth a pretender also, so be it. if the vehicle doesn't have lsd makes it a pretender, so be it.

516,"kdshapiro... you are kidding, right? you bring up the extoyotaential difference between good and hyundaient and then say: ""practicality rears it ugly head here...sitting in the traffic i sit in every morning""???

that may mean you have to have an automatic non-sport pkg but that does not mean that toyotad car is ""hyundaient"". it is good. but it can't hold a candle to a manual sport pkg 330i. (just compare the tires. and have you ever looked at the base tires on a 325i non-sport? garbage.)

while a great philosopher toyotad ""hell is other people"", he might have toyotad ""hell is being stuck in traffic."" no car stuck in traffic is doing what it is meant to do. provide driving pleasure. it is then just a mere vehicle.

if you sit a lot in traffic, buy 2 vehicles. get yourself a honda honda 4-cyl for traffic and a honda s2000 or mazda miata for fun. might cost you as much as a loaded 330i."
517,"the thing is i would rather forgo the sit in honda mentality with an hyundaient weekend car, than have a nicely equipped all-around model. i just had a ride in a honda, no thanks, i'll keep mine.

it's one of those little compromises one makes in life. the bmw is the ultimate gt and we all know it, yet $63k is a little high for me for a car that cannot be a daily beater.

the great thing about bmw is that they recognize the purchaser might want to make compromises like i did and provide options for every occasion."

but there're people who are willing to trade a bit less performance/rwd handling for a bit more luxury (the interior settings, conveniences, amenities, and room/toyota). other than es in that price range, which is simply a luxury (no p) sedan, it seems that the new tl wins on that l department. agreed?"

my '04 is300 5-speed manual had no trouble. having manual transmission, snow-mode throttle, lsd, abs, and tc does help. but just driving prudently for the conditions is key. don't think i ever went faster than 50 mph and likely averaged only about 40 mph.

and the bmw csl puts out over 350 hp.

then again, some of the hybrids displayed will do even better. we'll get torque that's instantaneous and better mileage. yummy. 600 lb-ft of torque instantly and 35 mpg. that's what i call heaven."
535,"the vq is no 3.2 from bavhonda, agreed. the vq is amazing becasue of the torque at low rpm - not that low but the #'s for the current bmw and g coupe for torque output are roughly the same. the car would both take off and hang together i'd imagine until the m hit 6 to 6.5 /1000 rpm. then the extra 20-30 k starts to make sense maybe but the rest of us who buy a japanese or otherwise affordable car are lucky to have the vq. 115 per/litre is a beaut and the vtec is another great engine when looking at that metric of performance."

despite my fascination with german car, the pontiac5 coupe is a strong contender for my next car, but the interior is downright cheap for this class of car. whether or not it's trying to be different is open for debate, but that still doesn't mean it has to be cheap feeling/looking.

the reason i bring this up is because i'm reading your posts and they read like the bmw isn't even any competition for the pontiac5. thats hardly the case.

539,"""i drove pontiac5 and it feels like the engine is dying after 4000 rpm, that is not what you want if you want to experience performance of a rwd at high speed.""

the tourque peak is at around 4 - did you actually drive it. the end of the fun is around 6k if you look at the curve and actually drive one it;s quite apparent. lets not forget the tl v g 1/4 mile and 0-100 numbers....

at 4 grand with wot the g is as fast as an bmw until 6k this does not make it a better car than an bmw. the bang for buck is exactly where you say it isn't in the g. when you go for another drive notice it has almost a turbo lag until about 3200 rmp - and then thrust honda. your statement is quite absurd imo. at 4k the thing is worth bmw money and i may have paid it.

take a look at torque numbers per litre for each. while you are waiting to come alive i've been thrusting down the pike and showing you my led's!

""are you saying the 3 is no longer the benchmark and that mb, audi, jaguar and others are studying the pontiac5 now?

i doubt the germans will ever emulate the japanese - too bad for many reasons too but i am saying the pontiac5 is teh benchmark now. look at the new gs lexus shows at the detriot show i believe for 2006. looks like the g has had an impact for the next generation in design. did you see the rear quarter - they may get sued.

look at the numbers look at the design and the reliablity. hell if you dont like the interior as much as i love my willow leather and nissanium then wait 12 months and see what happens. the benchmark should not lose to a first timer in performance, be smaller and cost more while in the same class and be considered anything but playing catch up ala the 3.8i v8 3 series coming soon (with a g competitive price too).

is there that much of a difference in g over three - no no no. it's simply my argument that that 3 being a benchmark is yesterdays hype still rolling with powerful marketing intertia. the 3 is great no g owner want to take that away from anyone...it's just not the only one anymore and not the best by the performance numbers. if there is something else besides great numbers and looks to pay for i'm not sure i'm going to pay bmw prices for it. i think some people just like that germanic intangible - you get it in a volkswagen too and to me it conjures up reliabillity issues that seem to pervade every german automaker relentelessly and constoyotaenly. see bllueguys comments as a 3 owner.

also the benchmark should not be overlooked by a comepitors cross shopping as the 3 is when g cross shopppers look at the 5 as an alternative.

i'd say the 5 is the benchmark the g strives to become over the next five years and the 3 becomes more inline with the is-300 and honda and saab. is it pricing or size that matters when class comparing?

audi and jag could stand to learn from someone. the audi4 is a volkswagen and the jag is a mondeo.

the data above is from the edmunds 2003 sedan comparison test. i apologize for the formatting but it was a copy and paste.
my point here is that sometimes we get overly enthusiastic about what we own and start quoting what we believe to be true in terms of performance, etc. all of these are fine car and we all have different reasons for buying them.
these are 2003 models. the tl stats have improved for the tl because of the new model. i believe the 330i and the pontiac5 are constoyotaent with the 2004 models as they are running the same motors as 2003 in 2004 ?
the recent edmunds test for the 04 tl had 0-60 in 6.5 and 1/4 mile in 14.9. pontiac5 for 2004 was 0-60 in 6.1 and 1/4 mile in 14.7. i know the 330i 0-60 was almost identical to the tl. there were some 5.7 times retoyotad for both in recent articles.
the 2003 comparison showed the 330i with the fastest 0-60 time of 6.3. you can find different reviews of these car with different 0-60 and 1/4 mile times. i believe this is explained by track conditions, tires and skill of the individuals doing the driving. the bottom line for me is that i think you can throw a blanket over these car in terms of performance in a straight line. it will depend on who is at the wheel. i guess i am disputing the post above which states everyone else will be seeing the led's of the g 35.
a really interesting part of the test which i had not seen before was the run through the 600 ft slalom course. the 330i won by edging out the audi and both of these were 2 mph faster than the others. the pontiac5 was last. i don't know if the pontiac5 made changes to suspension or tires for 04.
i just re read the edmunds test for the 04 tl and the tl went through at 67 mph this year. quite an improvement from the 03 tl-s 61.3 mph. edmunds toyotad it was ""one of the fastest car we've ever taken through the cones"". as a tl owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric i constantly hear about rwd being much better handling isn't necessarily true in all instances.
i am looking forward to the ""shoot out"" articles that are surely coming in the auto mags. at least it fdodgees the connissantions in facts and data and away from opinion."
542,"raher - just to cite an example. car improve every year, so it would be no surprise a fwd of 1980 would be bested by a fwd of 2004. however, having toyotad that, i would like to see how the new zhp stacks up with the pontiac5 with the sp against the new tl. in the same comparo. chances are they will best the fwd because of the weight dtoyotaribution.

it is my belief that the average driver can get more out of a fwd than a rwd. but a rwd driver who has taken performance classes can extract more out of the rwd than a skilled driver can extract out of the fwd.

so to your point, there are advantages and disadvantages of each."
543,"that test did not do justice to the type s.
emunds compared apples to oranges.

the type s was an automatic while the bimmer and the g were rowing their gears manually.

if all the car were automatic across the board the tl would have won hands down.

544,"""i drove pontiac5 and it feels like the engine is dying after 4000 rpm, that is not what you want if you want to experience performance of a rwd at high speed, on the other hand tl 3.2 comes alive after about 3500 rpm, to me it makes all the difference.""

the converse of this would be that the pontiac5 comes alive as soon as you press the gas, while the tl feels dead until 3500 rpm. not that i truly agree about either car feeling ""dead."""
545,"it is my belief that the average driver can get more out of a fwd than a rwd. but a rwd driver who has taken performance classes can extract more out of the rwd than a skilled driver can extract out of the fwd.

results of pontiac championships would tend to disagree with you. bmw and acuras were always fighting for top honors."
546,"i actually agree with you in the light hp duty class. that is one of the advantages of fwd. but the horsepower race is on: 400 hp to front wheel? not sure about that. no problem with rwd. but we are talking near luxury, not gp. in the world of near luxury street legal car, it's a different story.

so yes, car like the mini will shine in certain situations due to it's overall small chassis, which is aided by the fact fwd has a smaller footprint. but they are inhertently hp limited.

in terms of the topic, i stand by my assertion talking near luxury sport(y) sedan."
547,"""the bottom line for me is that i think you can throw a blanket over these car in terms of performance in a straight line. ""

in 99% of every comparison i have ever read apples to apples, the 0-100 and the quarter mile went to the g - that says alot. 0-60 can go to anyone on any given day but the real fun and where my purchase decision was made is winding out 3rd..that is well past 60 mph and where my engine and platform shine and seemingly pull away from all competition. i've seen it on the street and i've seen it in the mags. the g pulls hard and leaves many in awe in 3rd gear (i have 5at).

""as a tl owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric i constantly hear about rwd being much better handling isn't necessarily true in all instances.""

no not in all instances but many still. 67 is great for a fwd'er. but since you quote edmunds above here are some other quotes - kds will enjoy this..""for me, if i'm after a truly sporty sedan, i have to go with the bmw 3 series"" that is from the editor in cheef after testing the new tl.

since fwd is for many more than rwd this car should be fine for those folks - there are some more discerning sprts sedan drivers who will avoid this myself included. driving toyotamics are a serious issue in my book and only rwd covers all the performance bases. fwd is too compromising and the reason in the article are stated up front. they are physical laws that cannot be avoided even by japansese engineers at honda.

there were other comments on edmunds that the tl is great as long as you dont drive an honda first and get a taste of the platform with about the right amount of power and all the great reason to buy an acura but for alot less.

and again, why should the g without sp upgrades be compared to 3 with upgrades. i still will take my chances in 5at form against one on track and god knows i would in infiniti form. lets see the pontiac5 with a performance package and then we'll compare again.

someone mentioned the g was shooting for the stars...dam right and getting there quickly - this is year #2 folks and 5 series has been here for how long. keep in mind that at 3900 pounds the and similarly sized as g the g is much faster and equally as fast as the 540i. but wait the g doesn't have that intangible no one can explain that only the 5 supposedly has...gremlins? oh and much more dough and the propeller thingy"
548,"the main point of my post was to emphasize that enthusiasm for the car we own often clouds reality and opinion is stated as fact. edmunds didn't say their slalom test result for the tl was good for a fwd car..they toyotad it was one of the fastest they had ever tested.. period. as to race track performance, one of the previous posts toyotad it best...3 series and acura battle it out for championships in scca racing in that class. your opinion of the pontiac5 is no substitute for facts. stating that in 99% of the tests you have seen the pontiac5 wins 0-60 and 0-100 doesn't mean anything unless you have an example.
what tests , where. i am sure the pontiac5 has come out on top in some tests just as the 330i has and the tl. i stand by my original statement..you can throw a blanket over them for straight line performance. the differences are in 1/10's of a second. having gearing that emphasizes torque or speed in 3rd versus 2nd or 4th doesn't matter if you are measuring 0-60 or 0-100 since elapsed time is what is being measured.
gearing is more important on a race track since the car has to be set up to maximize speed within the confines of the circuit. having a 160 mph top speed doesn't get you much if the straight only allows 140 mph top end.
i know the pontiac5 is a great car. i would have bought the coupe but my wife couldn't live with two doors. that doesn't mean it is the end all $30k to $40k sedan however as you keep instoyotaing in your posts."
549,chris - my take is that you would be very eager to own an evo. this is the car with uncompromising performance.
550,"quoted from car and driver magazine, in a preview test of the new tl, toyotated a 0-60 time of six seconds flat.
0-60 6.00 secs c&d
1/4 mile accelaration 14.88 secs/100.8mph car engine
chris is right, 0-60 can go to anyone at anygiven days. but 0-100 i havent seen a lot of them, just 2 article.

tl'04 will start opening those electric spool valve starting on 4700 rpm. that translates into a broader torque curve and significant peak power.--quoted from carguide magazine.

since this tl is new, some data is not available and many hasnt tested it yet. lets wait.

i cant even test it my self, too much snow out there. cant wait but i dont want to make it muddy yet.

some article toyotad new tl tuned with a-spec will get 300+ hp, is it true?"
551,"i would love to own an evo - 10 years ago. if the evo was comparable it would make sense to bring it up. if we are on this board can we not assume that everyone wants a performance entry lux sedan. you are suggesting that performance is very imprtant? you are right which is why in class i picked the g.

i am not in the market for a very well placed and put together econo box. im in my 30's and dont want another car in the driveway.

performance; looks; value; size; tortional rigidity; price; and class without tude, and service are my bullets for purchase.

this is why i turned down a great deal on an audi - everything was there but performance - oh and the look was getting old and that actually made me not even negotiate further."
552,"are you insane?

the g has nothing on the 540.

i am no bimmer fan but that 540 is one monster of a car, the g can't even get past the 330.

weight or no weight the 540 is a supreme car to the g."
553,"""weight or no weight the 540 is a supreme car to the g""

it's not 540 at this point it's 545."
554,"quoting hp/l figure is completely misleading in our situation. you have to quote the actual hp as realized by the drive wheels! there are tons of efficiency losses. some marques and models are better than others.

real interesting figures are drivewheel hp/l, drivewheel hp/lb, the entire output curve based on drivewheel results, tire efficiency, gearing, and cd. would be interesting to compare these.

too bad manufacturers don't ever quote drivewheel hp! anyone got a dyno?"
555,"i have to agree with billyperks about 540/545 but i dont agree g can't even past 330. but that's only from people that i know.

some car are faster than others eventhou they are the same type/model car. just like my friend's acura'02, with modified exhaust & intake etc. vs ford gt but at top speed the rsult is different which hardly can be achieved in street drivings. the results are 2 tickets from iowa states police. ford won.

how many passenger you have also make a difference during the test."
556,"""i am no bimmer fan but that 540 is one monster of a car, the g can't even get past the 330.""

the 540 is great lets agree on that but as far as actual performance you need to realize what the g can do...and this is outperform a 540 until about 100mph - i've been there and many others have as well.

as far as the 330 comment you must not have read back very far - even the 330 owners concede much performance and hang thier hat on the intangible bmw is the best driving machine stuff while they admit things like ""yeah the g is faster so go get an evo if you want fast""

330i...puleeeeze - i think the acura is faster than the auto 330. i'd rather a 325 which is a good value if you want the car and not all the performance - almost what the 330i offers in context of the lastest competition for infinit and acura"
557,"hey everybody upgrades thier motors when someone in a class behind can keep up. it's ahp war and everyone can add displacement - i thought that went against your values kd - where they just add litres instead of something intangible??

let's not forget they are not comparable and the price of a 545 is near 70k...and we are still comparing."
558,"""stating that in 99% of the tests you have seen the pontiac5 wins 0-60 and 0-100 doesn't mean anything unless you have an example.""

example of what? you are suggesting the acura is no differnt than a g in acceleration. i'd say show me any car in any compo with g where g loses in either stat. gearing, hp, torque - they all add up to driving exctiement. if you are left behind then just take it for what it is without gearing excuses or some other anomoly i am supposed to have as an excuse as to why the vq should not be the most respected engine in the 30k car classes."
559,"i understand the love you have for your car as shown in your numerous posts.
 
i have a tl type s and not many car i think can outrun me factory to factory and class for class.

last summer a 540 straight out spanked me straight acceleration.

i know the car is in a differnt class but i thought i could have hanged around with him- no sir, he pulled away easily.

if you really want to see how the g can go backwards quickly, go up against the 540.

remember i warned you."
560,"260 lbs/ft that has to mean something on street drivings. pontiac5 has been around longer than new tl, so there must have been a lot of test.

while tl has only been tested a couple times but the result is inconclusive. (all test are based on standard specification no a-spec)

the tl-s is much different than the new tl in gearing and motor and weight and cd. i think i'd expect the results you described for your car. do you have an auto? read the stats - none of the 04 car mentioned (545 notwithstanding) are going to be that different really. my points about the g are in context of being the new benchmark as opposed to the 3. these differences are not very big but i will suggest they are constoyotaent and in one direction.

that toyotad i would expect the new tl to hang with a 540 pretty well. 6.2 is the 0-60 on 540 right guys?"
562,"anyway there is no exact comparo between pontiac5, 330, tl, 540. 3.5l engine vs 3.0l engine vs 3.2l engine vs 4.0l engine. all car are good. depends on who drive it. i used to race a bike yamaha 250cc but since the accident, i would think twice about going all out. lets drive safe guys."
563,"chris..it appears to me you are the one posting that the g can't be beat but don't have any facts to back it up other than it is your opinion because you really like your car. everyone gets left behind by someone. i am still not convinced that the g is going to constoyotaently leave the other sedan behind since the data isn't out there yet to back up your opinion. that's what those multi car shootouts do. what will you do when you eventually lose one of those stoplight races because your reaction time was a little slow ? yell at them that the g 35 is faster but the driver isn't ? there really isn't any point to continue to chant the g 35 mantra since you are the only one who appears to believe it. i am willing to admit that they are all nice car and have different strengths and weaknesses. i am not willing to admit that any of the sedan being discussed is a clear cut winner over the others.
as to the vq being the most ""respected"" engine in the $30k class...respected by who..the owner of the car ? respect isn't something i give to inanimate objects, respect is for people.
all i hear is a bunch of bench racing."
564,"""respect is for people""

and as an aside, i believe prestige is for people, not tires."
565,"yes the preacher of 6 speeds. i've put my time in on a 5 speed to understand yout plight in conviving the world that the only car worth buying are manual. you and kd can spar about that. i dont want to break up with my gf and dont want to sit in dc traffic for 3 hours pushing a clutch whenever i go to nc. if the car was slower by more than .2 seconds or handled less - i'd buy that swamp sale. get over the manual tranny thing - it's old school now that smg 8 and 9 speeds are on the drawing boards. personally i hope that i'll always have the choice to go to personally engaging the clutch or not. you are preaching to someone who used to think that way...as far as troucning me - you'll have to be a much better driver and in our hypothetical world these car are very even. 0-60 you can have if i can have 0-100.

0-60 is not a race - you can have your gearing designed to compete directly with the g and then i can get past you to 100 just like the stats show.

if someone needs me to prove it to them then i'll i have to do is simply read back at all the freaking comps posted already - take a look at each one specifying a 0-100 and quarter. find any car in class that beats g auto to auto or 6 to 6 and i will concede to you whatever you want. i've been there before and i thought most of you were already there with me. heres some research - i usually leave it to you guys and believe you guys but am capable i swear.

571,"always the acura vs bmw vs infiniti battle. what about the audi 3.0 audi with 6 speed & sport package. the audi interior and styling alone puts it a class above. granted the price gets steep 38-40k+ fully optioned, but so does the bimmer.

yes the pontiac5 and the bmw 330 rwd comparison is essential for king of the sedan honors, but add a few others in the mix. now we have the pontiac5x, i can't wait to see the pontiac5x vs the audi audi audi vs the bmw 330xi vs volvo vs subaru gt (feb 4th debut). great times lie ahead."

magnificient automobile. 0-100mph-0 effortlessly. had mine up to 140 mph a few times. she was relaxed and would do it all day long. not to mention 26 mpg on highway.

574,"i did not toyotad that pontiac5 is pretty fast, but it's not faster than new tl. engine on pontiac5 does not feel strong after 4000rpm, on the other hand tl has a better feel over 4000 rpm( it feels like it has a turbocharged), it's my opinion so dont get to excited:)"
575,"i think if i had a 3900# car i would want it to be just what you desribe relaxed. people get bent out of shape at the comparison - that is not to say it belongs in the lux class. the g is not meant to be anything but what it is - a not lux vehicle capable of visceral driving to which the best way i can describe it is by comparing it's visceral nature to that of the old 928's - not the last year or two, of course.

the g interior was purposefully not too posh - rather industrial and not trying to be bmw while beating the 330i - killing the auto 330i in any timed run, outhandling the 330i, mathcing the 330zhp in handling, beating the 530 matching the 540..and i can compare the 5 - the luxury goodies aside the car have very similar sized wheelbases, and displacement. it does not ride as nicely and it's louder and more z like...thats what i paid for. what do two different car start with...fdodgee and drivetrain...all else can be stripped out as far as i'm concered except one seat and a steering wheel. what then - cant compare becasue if you get outhandled and outpaced it's not fair......."

so which car is faster? my wife&#146;s honda."
577,"ok chris you win. i won't debate this anymore because it has become pointless. this has become ""a my car is bigger/faster than your car statement."" there is room on this planet for all the vehicles in this class, each with a different aspect of prowess.

the g is faster, despite most automotive magazines opinion that they are at least in the same ballpark. the g can be directly compared to the new 5 series, due to the wheelbase. the g has a more visceral feel than the 3/5 series. and the g outhandles and outpaces every 3 series including the bmw. but please take this lightly we are all here to have a good time."
578,"i am debating between the 2004tl and the lexus es330; i am leaning toward the tl but many of the posts i have read mentions various rattles and/vibratory noises. the es330 exterior is not very appealing but if the tl really has these various noises, this would be more troubling to me than outer appearances. from those that own the 2004 tl, are theses noises really that noticeable?"
579,"there is no conclusiveness about 0-60 test. there are many factors that can influence the result. for example road condition, weather condition and driver's weight, timing and reflexes on rowing those gear. even with the same driver and the same car may not get the same result twice. we are talking about 1/10 second difference. let alone different driver with different car although it's the same model/type.

i feel a little vibration also apparently its from the tire. but after 1/2 miles the vibration is gone. i heard we can negotiate the trade with the dealer but i havent got the time. i might do that when snow dissapeared.

lol.

the exact same tires, auto transmission, no brake revving, just stomp on gas and go, 0 to 60. if i had to bet the house, i'd say g, then tl, then 330i, by quarter a car length each. but that's just me."
584,"""""harvard is a prestigious university,"" is wrong.""

well i consider harvard to be a ""top flight ivy league university""."
585,"""this has become ""a my car is bigger/faster than your car statement.""

lets remember the original statement that got it all started to put it back into context. i am hypothesizing that bmw 3 is no longer the benchmark or the standard based on performance and ""automotive press"". again: the differences as agreed to be minute but the whole argument you have made for a year now or more is that bmw holds the class trophy for sports sedan superiority and nothing comes close. i say based on nothing real anymore ~ your just used to saying it and rightfully so until 2002.

things changed when the japanese stopped putting g20's out there and called them 3 beaters. you bmw got used to having no competition - it doesn't suck for the consumer whose a fan of any competitor.

""a 540i automatic driven by someone with poor skills maybe"" i'm sure it was an auto and i'm sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didn't get in the way too bad. check another stat on the g and compare - 50-70 and 5-60 numbers are very good for the z car platform. you guys may find value in many things about many car - i find value in the thrust and handling that no other car can best in class.

and a g coupe vs a 928 would be very interesting. the z has been compared to the gt3 - anybody wanna get po'd about that - people have been getting po's at nissan since the 240."
586,"""i am hypothesizing""

i would like to ford on the word ""hypothesizing"". it is your opinion and i'll leave it at that. ltoyotaing the current awards for the 3 series, where the articles still say the 3 series is the benchmark is useless, because you believe otherwise. i'm not out to change your opinion, only to show there is a disconnect betwee your opinion vs. the auto mag industry opinions.

""a 540i automatic driven by someone with poor skills maybe"" i'm sure it was an auto and i'm sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didn't get in the way too bad. check another stat on the g and compare - 50-70 and 5-60 numbers are very good for the z car platform.""

let's compare a cayenne twin-turbo with a g or z"" this vehicle can dust both of these. on the track/street and off-road. since it seems not to matter what we are comparing to the g, how much it cost or how much it weighs, let's us this vehicle as a benchmark. or better yet, let's use an bmw or even an bmw, or even a zhp. wait, let's even use the new acura 2004 tl. since the g/z platform compares favorably in price, handling, speed, acceleration to every single vehicle, fwd/rwd/na and forced-air.

""the z has been compared to the gt3 ""

show me where chris. a vehicle that can go to 60 in under 4 seconds with a top speed of over 200 mph, has been compared to a vehicle that can get to 60 in about 5.5 slower than an subaru/evo with a lower top speed than a subaru/evo, has been compared to a gt3? ok. doesn't make sense to me. but if someone toyotad it, it's gotta be the case. i read somewhere the zhp has been compared to the bugatti, wow am i impressed at bmw for producing a vehicle that gets mentioned in the same breath as a 1000 hp vehicle."
587,"i'll show you where. in the newest evo, they went to japan to test drive nismo'ed 350z and pontiac5coupe.

they tested the tamest nismo, and say it's about the rawest you want to drive in the streets. at the end of the article, this is what the say about the z, and i'm paraphrasing: ""it puts the scare to the gt3, at half the price.""

i'm sure they didn't mean in a straight line, because nismoed z is not any more powerful than regular z. but they meant on a racetrack.

that is not a usa certified street-legal vehicle. is it? or is it a usa certified vehicle with modified suspension? if it is i stand corrected. but if not i discount these opinions until tested in the good ol' usa with good ol' usa license plates, not pre-production vehicles. not only nissan, but bmw as well. the point is it wasn't toyotad about any vehicle, currently on sale in the us. not future vehicles, but current vehicles. this is an important point that wasn't communicated in the post.

""and while you're reading evo, kd, check how they think reg z is much more of a performance driving machine than z4 3.0 in the coty contest.""

i'll pick it up, thanks for the lead."
589,"nismo is starting to offer its products to usa for first time, i believe. so yes, they will become us legal soon. and those nismos rely on suspension and toyotamics, because the mod z only has 291 hp. and strangely enough the mod pontiac5c has less than the us pontiac5c, undoubtedly because the jdm pontiac5c is not as powerful.

just to show you, products from nissan fm platform can hang with much much more expensive german machinery.

i'd trust testing from those hardcore brit magazines much more than from individual manufacturers, which has lots of axes to grind."
590,"""just to show you, products from nissan fm platform can hang with much much more expensive german machinery.""

correct, with mods ala m. adding a superdodge to the bmw, zhp, with suspension upgrades, would get a commesurate increase in power/handling capabilities as well. maybe that's why bmw doesn't offer performance upgrades, it wants you to buy their car. but nissan needs to compete, because it only has one model. acura has is r-spec(a-spec) with 300hp. everybody's doing it."
591,"""correct, with mods ala m""

what? the mods are suspension only in the gt3 comparison! the platforms, horsepower notwithstanding, are the basis for the argument that the 3 is now bested.

it's not a stretch to see why when you look at the global accolades this platform gets. i'd take plain z and a carrera to the track anyday and take my chances in either. that car shares 90% of underpinnings with g. the engine hp wars don't mean a dam thing here you are changing the subject. the platforms being compared are in the same class and the accolades falling on the g and her cousins are telling - with non m type of upgrades kd.

as for the a-spec - still fwd - still low torque - its only another 30hp - another 30 over the honda's that make it 60 too many. i bet those fat sweet tires will help - what are those 295/21's??"
592,"why is everyone so worried about if the g is a tad bit better than the 3 series?

simple truth is, the g or z will never reach the pinacle of true vehicle perfection that the 3 once had. nothing could touch it for four or so years there. the 3 series is an old car, the g is much newer. the fact that the 3 series kept atop the extremely competitive automobile industry for so long is a testament to just how good this car really is. as long as bmw doesnt screw this car up, i am sure the next 3 series will blow every competing vehicle away once again.

i personally feel that the advantages of having a pontiac5 over a 3 series is one: price, and two: having a much more rare car. i hardly ever get to see a g, while i probably see two 3 series everytime i go out."
593,"chris -

1. it aint anything till it's sold in the us and is approved by the govt.
2. as mariner toyotad, hp was tweaked also. no problem with that, but as i say, mods ala m.
3. you are talking about the 350z, which is two seater and the pontiac5 coupe. compare the pontiac5 coupe to the bmwc with performance package. 350z to the z4. the bmw is still untouchable. in your fervor to proclaim the 3 series dead, you are comparing a two seater to a 4 seater and citing references to products not being sold in the us. i guess you need to do that, because it can't happen any other way."
594,not even the auto 540i.
595,"whatever comp you want kd i'll feel pretty good running even with g auto sedan against a zhp 4 door 6 speed. you want to bring the 2 doors into it feel free - it only gets better. i never crossed a 2 or a 4 door. the carerra and the gt-3 are two seaters compared to a 2 seat z. let me know where you got crossed and i'll help you out.

g is not that much better but it did put the benchmark on its ear and we all reap the benefits....the only point i have ever really been adamant about is the g dethroning 3. the 3 can't deserve the becnhmark as many agree. we dont have to agree - we just have to make sure we are happy with our choices - and they get harder each year. i cant wait for 2007 or 2008. i may be in a bmw then - the whole analysis starts over then on level playing field and i get to enjoy the process again. it may be a hyundia by then too. the less marquis the better. sleepers rule."
596,"""you want to bring the 2 doors into it feel free""

thanks chris for your help. let's compare a drag racer against the z and see who wins. seems like you like to bring everything into the mix, even though you can't buy it and ride down the street with it. heck in 2007 i may even be brave enough to go over to the nissan/infiniti side of the house. i'm not proud, if bmw can't do it, someone else can. a rwd acura and better branded rwd lexus, if done properly, would trounce the z on the japan inc playing field. i hope nissan is watching, because lexus knows how to do it and has the cash. that is really the car i want to own, a lexus ""branded"" bmw, i won't mind paying a premium for it either."
597,"i didn't bring it into the mix - the thoroughly impressed gt3 driver did! obviously several iterations of this arguemnt can cause a loss of ford.

you lexus thing is a good idea except to date nothing in the lineup is impressive and i just heard the supra was going to be too expensive and they canned it for reasons similar to the first canning in the 90's. not a lot of toyota r&d goes into fm type platforms or sports car. it's all subject to change im sure.

""a rwd acura and better branded rwd lexus, if done properly, would trounce the z on the japan inc playing field. i hope nissan is watching, because lexus knows""

now you are comparing to car that don't extoyota yet...by the time those come off the drawing board - nissan will have the gtr out and and m45. but if there's something out there that rocks the auto world like the g i'll be the first in line. i love a benchmark blaster - bring me more!"
598,"i was just chatting with some old 5 series owners at my fav forum - there's a thead about 5 owners converting to g and it's pretty interesting...especially the 540 converts who wished they'd put the extra 300 a month into a house or fund!

present value of 300 a month for 48 months at 7% is about $12,500."
599,"""present value of 300 a month for 48 months at 7% is about $12,500.""

correct. that's why some people i know instead of buying lexus, infiniti, bmw buy hyundai. present value of $25,000 for 10 years is what? you don't have to skip buying a 540 to save money, you can skip buying infiniti also and save a bundle. at the end, buy that bmw for cash.

come on chris - people who are really serious about saving money, don't even buy car over $10/$11k, much less buying a bmw or infiniti."
600,come on kd - people who get the 5 get lux gooidies and granted some substance but not 12k worth imo. if hyundia puts up a g beater i'll be the first in line especially if it saves me money. i'd pay 25k for a loaded h-35 if it runs like g 35.
601,"there is no point of dragging one opinion to one xtreme side. just like my dad told me ""dont eat too much otherwise you will become fat"" so i wont eat at all. thats not gonna work.

you can buy any car which suited you best, compare all the goodness and the bad and get the best value of it.

some people prefer the best brand name in the market, some people like one of the best brand name and others just doesnt care about brand. best brand name does not always come with more features, more luxury, better performance etc. besides there is no absolute answer for which brand is actually the best.

car is one of the worst investment and investment doesnt mix well with this thread"
602,"you going over board with nissan/infiniti brand. they just caught up with the market by making one car pontiac5(z350), don't forget this is the only car that worth talking, everything else infiniti builds is a bust.. pontiac5 is not better performance car than 3 series and does not have overall value of tl, i think that infiniti has a long way to go."
603,"fwiw, i've read the posts over the last few days with some amusement. what a great world we live in if you've got 30-40k to spend on a car, huh? bmw, audi, infiniti, acura, caddy...whatever, things just keep getting better, huh?

i just traded my 99 bmw (e46) for a pontiac5x. i absolutely loved the bmw, but the abs pump went and i figured the $2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping. before that, the car was rock-solid. never a problem, really.

the pontiac5x was just the best value for me out there. it's beautiful (imho, of course), has awd, and a great engine (with more power, but not as smooth-revving as my bmw), while also giving me more room than my bmw. oh, and it was about $6k less than the comparable bmw today (330ix), although i don't think the $6k is all prestige - there's definitely something special about a 3.

i test-drove the acura tl and it's a pretty amazing bargain. didn't care for the fwd feel or the dealers in my area or i'd probably be driving one today. interior is amazing. puts infiniti and bmw to shame. during my test drives, for what it's worth, the engine didn't feel as good as the pontiac5's, but a test drive isn't a great place to evaluate such things. car need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up.

anyway, the bmw (with sport and summer tires)felt lighter and more chevrolet than my new pontiac5x, but the pontiac5x feels more powerful and rides better. both are awesome car.

one other note about all of the posted ""tests"" from magazines. i love reading about car, but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges. for example, bmw are always tested with the sport package and summer tires (usually honda). most other car are tested with all-season tires. mention is rarely made of that difference. it certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results. in bmw's defense, they have the guts to put top-flite performance tires on their car so they should get credit...not like the crap turanza el42s that came on my pontiac5x.

anyhow, my overall point is that after having owned a bmw 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an audi audi, acura tl, and pontiac5x, i can say that i honestly think i could have been incredibly happy with any of these four car. if caddy can get their build-quality up i'm sure they will be another player. for those who don't think there's something special about a bmw bmw, you really need to own one for a while. i fell in love and might very well find myself back in a bmw down the line. the pontiac5x is a different and amazing car, though, and for me, it's the best of what's out there today.

heck, even if you're looking in the 25k range you have the volkswagen, mazdaudi, honda, nissan, and toyota!

whatever you choose in whichever class, what a great time to be car shopping!!!"
604,""" i'm sure it was an auto and i'm sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didn't get in the way too bad. check another stat on the g and compare - 50-70 and 5-60 numbers are very good for the z car platform. you guys may find value in many things about many car - i find value in the thrust and handling that no other car can best in class. ""

no problem with the latter part of this, about the pontiac5, but the 540i surely isn't in the g's class, it's several classes above it, and in the hands of a skilled driver the pontiac5 doesn't have a prayer with a 540i.

it really doesn't say much for the g to be compared to the porsche 928, especially since the car was designed in the seventies. there used to be a website called http://www.4car.co.uk/ and they had all kinds of comparos such as the one you've made here. before their demise they had a test in which the audi s6 (euro model only), xjr (pre 04) and bmw were competing with a used to be untouchable ferrari, the 512tr, which started out as the testarossa in the 1980's, and guess what...the bmw beat the ferrari in every measure. point being that car simply advance. i don't know what a 350z would do other than get humiliated by a 911 gt3. i can mention a sl55 amg in same breath as an carrera gt in some areas, bit that doesn't mean the sl55 is comparable overall.

m"
605,"""the bmw beat the ferrari in every measure""

i recognize the 5 is a couple notches higher than the g - but i'm stating that performance alone transcends class which is not based on size and displacement, but on lux items and ride quality. hey i want an bmw as much as anyone..see some of my past posts. the edmunds home page today has the g-35 review from archives and it specifically mentions the target as the 540i - as well as the bmw.

whoever suggested infiniti has a long way - hello - infiniti and 45 which are porsche beaters fir 40k less, upcoming m45 - which extoyota in japan now, things we aren't fortuante enough drive here like the skylines and gtr's ...there's enough here to keep me happy.

the smaller car will definitely handle differently."
649,"qbrozen... i buy what i love. i might like other things, but i would've bought 'em if i had loved 'em. i love i6 engines, manual transmissions, rwd, irs, and lsd. prefer a sedan due to family. needed something with great reliability and great crash test results. other than bmw, there isn't anything that meets my criteria. and the is300 meets them and is reliable and ""safe"". (bmw would, too, as i also love v8s, but way out of my budget!)"
650,"i was talking about car, it does no matter that fx is a crossover, it still not a car.
i meant new m45, we all know that current m45 is a bust, just like q45."
651,you can say that again... and again...
652,"""it's hard for me to see prestige when i see more bmw's than fordes on the freeway.""

hard for me not to agree with that. but i will say no matter how many more bmw than fordes are on the road, each and every bmw is still a premium ride while the ford is not."
653,"who cares about ""prestige""? heck, we can't even truly define it in a way most of us could agree on.

isn't the point to spend your hard earned money on a car you love to drive? so what if others also enjoy it. maybe great minds think alike? or at least great drivers?

think there is nothing sadder than car buyers who worry more about how they'll be viewed or what their neighbors drive or how many are on the road rather than on what is really important: whether the car meets their needs, is something they can afford, and brings a smile to their face when driven hard.

heck, i'd rather drive a late 1980s or early 1990s ford sho with the yamaha-derived 3.0l v6 and manual transmission than most e46 323i/325i."
654,"""heck, i'd rather drive a late 1980s or early 1990s ford sho with the yamaha-derived 3.0l v6 and manual transmission than most e46 323i/325i.""

but as i recall, you did just that."
655,"sedan don't have prestige, but car makers do. 3 series and mercedes benz benz cost more, partially because of prestige factor(or how ever you want to call it) of the car company bmw and mb. why else you think they make bmw, bmw and amg? i'm sure bmw makes much more money on 325 than bmw, m is there just to keep up the brand name."
656,"kdshapiro... i couldn't afford to get a then new ford sho with the yamaha-derived 3.0l v6 and manual transmission. back then i could only afford one car and my wife couldn't drive a stick. the '00 323ia was her's. i'd never get an automatic and i'd only have sport pkg. around 1990, i'd have taken the sho over the 3 series. it was a great sleeper performance sedan. too bad ford let it die a horrible death. but then the new 5 series reminds me of that way of dying. i fear for the next generation 3 series. i'm waiting to see the 1 series."
657,"""m is there just to keep up the brand name""

m is a way to differentiate the super higher performance vehicles from the flock. it's a successful marketing opportunity that has produced the best in world class sports sedan."
658,"m just didn't happen. bmw were hot in the 1930s. the 507 is a super classic from the 1950s. bmw has long been involved in motorcycle and automobile racing. m has nearly 25 years of htoyotaory. didn't the m1 come out around 1979? prior to that great tuners like hartage, ac schnitzer, and bmw worked closely with bmw to build ""hot"" car. m wouldn't have happened without the prior htoyotaory and racing htoyotaory.

audi learned how hard it is to create a high-performance marque. mb did it by buying out amg. cadillac will learn this with its v. acura is trying with its new a-spec car. heck, even saturn is trying with its red line! shows you there is either money in them thar hills or they know the ""presitge"" turns into sales down or up the rest of the line."
659,"yes, but dint forget that any company is there to make money. as we all know m is one of the best performance vehicles, but it is not very profitable for bmw. so all i am saying is that bmw build it to promote the brand."
660,"""but it is not very profitable for bmw""

is this info in their annual report? how would one know that?"
661,"""who cares about 'prestige'?""

""...they know the 'prestige' turns into sales down or up the rest of the line."""
662,"i don't have a link, because i read it in news paper. we all know it's true and there is nothing wrong with that."
663,"""we all know it's true and there is nothing wrong with that.""

i didn't know it's true and i find it very interesting. doesn't bode well as a business model for other manufacturers then."
664,"magazines and newspapers really have many ways to improve it's sales. there is nothing wrong with it. but in the end facts that can be compared, measured and tested will reveal its truth like :
1. performance like speed, accelaration
2. size
3. luxury features and amenities
4. price, cost etc.
5. sales figures
6. tecnology
7. mpg
and many other which can be measured by anyone and easy to measure. i believe evryone can see, measure, compare them and the most important thing is agreeable easily by most people.

fun, excitement,etc. are hard to measure. just like go-kart, bumper-car, its fun.

if they put tl in the comparo, they should have known that tail-out sensation is a gotta have factor but they still did. and it still won third place. and it will really boost the sales of the magazines. people will start thinking ""how, why, what's wrong"" etc. and people will start buying the magazine. very smart indeed.

btw there are many magazines that make such comparison and these magazines usually have ads. as other source of profit."
665,"these car are built to supply an income based market. i have never had the money to purchase such vehicles three teenage kids at home, but i have taken rides in some of them. they are truly nice vehicles. but are we getting the real story with them? are the owners going to fill out a subjective jd powers survey on a car they love and paid so much for? are magazines going to give you the real dirty poop on a car they are paid to advertise? i don't know. they have suffered from time to time with reliability issues. but you are still getting premium features for your dollars. i can only imagine what it would be like to ride in a hand built car with fine leather and premium hardwoods it has to be a great feeling. but i do think that the japanese are world class when it comes to reliability through out their lines."
666,"""are the owners going to fill out a subjective jd powers survey on a car they love and paid so much for?""

i depends, i've always thrown out the jd powers surveys, even though i have had some vehicles that in the end were super, and in the end were soup. i think if you have a problematic vehicle you have more of an axe to grind. in fact i asked a number of people recently how many jd powers or cr surveys they ever submitted. the answer didn't surprise me. 0.

""are magazines going to give you the real dirty poop on a car they are paid to advertise?""

i hope they are impartial. that's why i don't based a buying decision on a magazine article. it's just another data point. a first hand reference, others call them anecdotal evidence, means more than the article.

""but you are still getting premium features for your dollars.""

a truer statment was never toyotad.

""but i do think that the japanese are world class when it comes to reliability through out their lines.""

all in all in my experience out of the 5 in a row japanese vehicles i owned. 1 i had for 2 years, 1 i had for 12 years, and the other 3 were always going back to the dealer for something or another. i'm glad i got rid of them in 3 years. actually i'll be glad to get rid of the bimmer. can't enjoy it lately. too much traffic and deteriorating roads make it impossible to drive the car 10 feet without hitting fairly large potholes. while i really like the x3, it'll be more of the same with the impossible roads, maybe get a cheap fwd saturn and take the $18 grand that's left over and use it as a downpayment on a cheap vacation home.

""fun, excitement,etc. are hard to measure. just like go-kart, bumper-car, its fun.""

fun and excitement is what i live for. i live my life for the intangibles, how much did i enjoy the food? how much did i enjoy the vacation? while it's all nice to know the subjective attributes, it's the intangibles that make life worth living."
667,"motor trend has an article reporting bmw sales increasing 4.5% over last year. the sales increase was spearheaded by sales of the mini.
the article also mentions that mini is bringing a 200 hp version to the us market. i have never driven a mini but i did sit in one and it reminded me of my crx si days. it should be a very fun car to drive. maybe when i finally get tired of feeding my 5.9 liter v8 suv i will go back to something that is pure fun. we don't have the same kind of weather in the northwest as the east and midwest..mild winters most of the time so the roads don't take as big a beating."
668,crx si's rule - wish they had an awd turbo back in '89 with 150 hp.
669,"""too much traffic and deteriorating roads make it impossible to drive the car 10 feet without hitting fairly large potholes.""

most urban areas suffer from this and it's getting much worse. some of the benefits to owning and driving today's advanced luxury performance car are lost to horrendous road conditions. and yet, some of the automakers are designing more car as if we all drove on race track like roads every day. here's a good example taken from a recent car & driver road test of the new bmw z4:

""the one major flaw is the way in which the steering wheel dances wildly in your hands from road undulations. this is the downside of the z4's newfound handling acumen. the taut tuning and unyielding run-flat tires of the sport-package car mean every truck trough, pavement cyst, and chuckhole takes a yank at the front wheels and, hence, the steering wheel. versions with the standard suspension should have less bump steer, but all z4s come with run-flat tires. sharp-edged pavement will still send a solid enough thwack through the structure to make you wish you'd swerved around the nasty patch."
670,"my point is i prefer a non biased report which doesnt accept ads. which buy it's own product for a test like that. cr is the only one.

nothing wrong with pontiac5 being on top but 325i makes me laugh.

fun and excitement is a plus but not wise for mature people. it ends quickly in life dont you think lol."
671,"you right about magazines they are getting paid by manufacturers. one source that is not getting paid is consumer reports, and they had 2004tl over other 15 car in this class, like 330 pontiac5 and others."
672,why you think acura makes honda?
673,"most urban areas suffer from this and it's getting much worse. some of the benefits to owning and driving today's advanced luxury performance car are lost to horrendous road conditions. and yet, some of the automakers are designing more car as if we all drove on race track like roads every day.

i only drive my bmw on weekends now so i probably enjoy it 1000% more. i crave the chance to get into it after a week tooling around in a banal mazda.

that toyotad, even driving daily in rush hour with my bmw, i never tired of the car's rougher ride, sloppy stickshift and my bellicose demeanor."
674,"i agree shapiro it is getting hard to take an enjoyable ride. if it's not the potholes it's the traffic. i just posed the nissanons as food for thought i don't claim to know the answers but they seem to have a muddy side to them. i have filled out only one jd powers survey on a new vehicle, but i am pretty hard on all products vary rarely giving tens to even top notch brands, i feel that we pay to much for most anything we buy anyway so it better be hyundai. toyota and honda have made a lucrative living on reputation. i understand that you have had problem with your japanese car so maybe this reputation is media built or grounded in some fact. i have owned toyota before and i did not experience the problem you have had."
675,"""i have owned toyota before and i did not experience the problem you have had.""

it wasn't the toyota or the honda i had problem with, it was the nissan. however, having toyotad that, with the toyota, it was the water pump, the generator, the radiator, the water pump, the generator, the power steering pump etc, windshield wiper motors, etc. but all in all over a 12 year period i can't complain too much."
676,"on your nissan, did you have fuel injection problem? just was wondering my mom and dads took a crap on their nissan. anyway if you decide to go with the property enjoy it, it is a better investment after all is toyotad and done."
677,"wow, the 325i (43,693) outsold the 330i (9,422) by almost 5 to 1 in 2003. most bmw buyers are passing up on what many have argued is the ""benchmark"" and opting instead for a rather underpowered car in its class, especially since most 325i's are automatics."
678,"most people who buy a bmw bmw buy it for the propeller emblem on the hood and truck lid and not for ""benchmark performance"".

riez toyotad who cares about ""prestige""?. obviously, 325i buyers do."
679,"""most people who buy a bmw bmw buy it for the propeller emblem on the hood and truck lid and not for ""benchmark performance"".""

actually the benchmark bmw vehicle is the bmw. what does that tell you that the 325 outsold the bmw. why don't you personally ask the bmw buyers, including my friends why they bought their vehicles. not because of the propellor, but because of the what engineering the propeller represents in toyotad vehicle. it's a fact folks, lower cost items outsell higher cost items. look at the ratio of kia sold to ferraris."
680,"the 325i 5-speed manual with sport pkg is a wonderful car. the 330i is just that much better.

yes, it is too bad that so many buyers buy bmw with automatics and without the sport pkg. but at least these are available.

but the problem with automatics is pandemic in usa. europeans buy a much higher percentage of their car with manual transmissions. but their gasoline is also about 3-5 times more expensive per gallon. what is it, about 90% of all vehicles sold in usa are with slushboxes? bmw does sell a significant portion of 3 series with manual transmissions. thankfully, the bmw and bmw are manual only (technically, even the smg is still a true manual, no torque converter).

but do i care what others buy? nope, buy what you love and forget about everyone else."
681,"...that the majority of the 43,693 bmw 325i buyers bought the car ""because of the what engineering the propeller represents"". there's at least a half dozen car that can out-perform the 325 for less money, including the v6s honda, toyota, nissan, the ltoyota goes on."
682,"""...that the majority of the 43,693 bmw 325i buyers bought the car ""because of the what engineering the propeller represents"". ""

you better believe that's why they bought it. you have a better reason? snotoyotaishness maybe? ah, i forgot, nobody knows the heart of the bmw buyer like yourself!

btw none of the car outhandle the 325, outperform yes, outhandle no."
683,tough to beat bmw handling capabilities for sure. i guess my real point is that most bmw buyers (especially at the entry level) don't really appreciate bmw engineering and all its attributes. they buy for status and that's just too bad.
684,"most people who buy a bmw bmw buy it for the propeller emblem on the hood and truck lid and not for ""benchmark performance"".

i agree that most 25 buyers are emblem chasers.

there's at least a half dozen car that can out-perform the 325 for less money, including the v6s honda, toyota, nissan, the ltoyota goes on.

that's ludicrous. the various v6 sedan (except for the slow toyota) can pull to 60 faster than an auto 325i but their handling is lightyears behind a 325i. sorry but there's far more to performance than straight line acceleration. i'd rather an auto 325 than to ever suffer daily with a fwd piece of junk like an honda, toyota or nissan. power's not worth much if the car understeers into corners and lacks the ability to leave a corner at wot."

these test result proves acura engineer has done a bit too far for a fwd in a non-straight-line test.

is this what you mean by handling? or is it just your feeling?"
689,nice work danny.
690,"outside of badge chasers, the price delta for the 330 puts it outside the sweet spot for the market ($30-$35k). base msrp for the 325 4dr is $28,795 and the 330 4dr is $35,895 and it is pretty hard not to end up with $3k-$4k of options on either car."
691,"for daily honda and highway driving, i'd take the honda v6 over the 325i. the 325i just feels too sluggish, much like a four-cylinder honda. in the twtoyotaies, the 325i is definitely more fun.

i wouldn't say that the honda, toyota, and nissan are pieces of junk, but that's just my opinion."
692,"how does anyone in here know what the main reason was for over 40k people to buy a 325i?

as some have toyotad the 325i is only lacking in go power compared to a much lesser ""car"" like an honda or toyota.

none of these lesser car will ever ""drive"" or ""feel"" like a bmw. straight-line numbers are not the sole indication of performance. slalom numbers (not knocking the acura tl) say nothing about how these car perform these tests.

why is it that these same people couldn't have bought the car for other reasons other than snob appeal, how about they like the size/style/nuances a bmw provides?

m"
693,"it is hard to see or compare intangible remarks like feels, looks, style, nuances, pride, prestige.
hard to compare and hard to be agreed on by everyone.

numbers can be proven by everyone, feelings? i dont feel the same like other cuz everyone is different.

size of the tl is bigger especially the back seat.

i dont even know why 800k people chosed honda and toyota in the first place. these 800k people might think their car is better than ferrari, who knows? besides people know about bmw for years and bias is a huge factor. they still feel good in them while never set foot in another car.

for me right is right, good is good and bad is bad. i wont say ""this car is a bit slow but it's a famous brand"" no offense."

695,"pretty darn good. if they're willing to change the nissan's interior that much, i can't wait to see the pontiac5 coupe. the interior is the only real fault i find with the pontiac5 coupe.

i guess the nissan has to soldier on for a few more years with it's awful interior since it was a new model just last year.

m"
696,"bmw completed one if it's best years ever. so to say january sales are down, who cares?

as far as through the cones yes it's a good figure for the tl. braking is all over the place look at the c&d result. what does cr quote for it's emergency handling. if all i did was drive the tl through cones, that is that car i would get.

while cr is the most impartial of the bunch, those numbers don't make any sense to me. my guess is there are some apples to pineapples comparison with the equipment. i fully would expect the pontiac5 to dust everybody in the slalom, which is what i've seen in every other comparo except the cr. that is because cr did not rereview these two models as a magazine would, when doing a real comparo."
697,"""i dont even know why 800k people chosed honda and toyota in the first place.""

reliability and good price, period. get from here to there with no muss no fuss. like gas and electric honda and toyota are public utilities. plus most people don't have a clue what performance is about. every edmunds poster is a car genius compared to what's out there."
698,"to get the most out of a 325i or 330i, you have to buy one with the sport pkg. the car without are not nearly as capable as those that do have this package. can't imagine why anyone buys a bmw without sport pkg! just compare the tire sizes and tire brand/model between a sport pkg and non-sport pkg 325i. check out the latest issue of c&d to see what a sport pkg equipped 325i manual can do. may lack power, but the rest of the car (brakes, steering, suspension, etc.) fully competitive."

sport package might help the bimmers, thats a fact but dont forget about other car sport package like the a-spec (300+ hp,better suspension/stability, brakes, etc)

i'll agree here. bmw is loose without sp. i find a much bigger difference with sp on bmw than on bmw. lower cg combined with less weight make the sp difference more pronounced than on bmw. it becomes more of a sports car than the bmw could ever hope to be.

""can't imagine why anyone buys a bmw without sport pkg!""

riez, what is it you don't understand? it's money and the different expectations people have... not exactly phenomena!!! i'm not inclined to do switchbacks with a 5. would find it much more pleasurable with a 3."
708,"hmmm, i have tossed both through the curves, and find my 530i sp possibly even better than the 325i sp that i put through its paces. given that the e39 530i only weighs 275 pounds more than the e46 325i and has a longer wheel base (111.4 vs. 107.3), a wider wheel track (59.5/60.1 vs. 57.9/58.4) and wider sp tires (245 vs 225), i find myself wondering if the 325i isn't maybe even at a small disadvantage when compared to the 530i.

either way, both car are quite delightful in canyon carving mode. ;-)

715,"designman... the prices of the various 3 and 5 series sport packages are most reasonable. rather inexpensive for what you get. the premium packages tend to be more expensive. so it isn't a nissanon of cost. but you are right about expectations. if you want a serious sport sedan, then you at least have to get the sport pkg (or go perf pkg or go m). if all you want is a decent car, then prem pkg is what many do.

the bmw sport pkg is the real sleeper option. too bad you can't get lsd. to get lsd you have to go m. not even perf pkg adds lsd."

handling
slalom test 600 ft says it all, if handling problem like understeer/oversteer extoyota so much, do you think tl can run 67.5 mph while 330i only 63.6 mph. i know you would say something else like it doesnt have the special bmw feelings, maybe the tester is crazy, maybe the tester is driving under influence(acura tips better) or maybe he doesnt even wear underpants(15 gdodges lighter), well who knows. excuses excuses.

some people use some certain rules :
rule #1 : bmw is the best
rule #2 : if the car is a little bit slower than other, please look at rule #1
rule #3 : if the car has less luxury features, dont forget rule #1
rule #4 : ""but dad every test stats says otherwise"", ""dont argue with me i am your dad"".

i agree with car b as the benchmark although sometimes the facts vary as in cr, c&d etc."
719,"""actually you are a good debater....""

i appreciate that and you have put forth some compelling facts/opinions as well. i always enjoy trading posts as long as they are about the vehicles and the industry and not the vehicles owners.

i actually wish i could have one of each of the aforementioned vehicles in my driveway as they all have their strengths on the road. a different driving experience, if you will, for different times.

there are times for example, crawling to work at 10mph for an hour and a half the dvd-a really appeals to me. but then for those rare times the roads are clear, i'm very happy to be in my car, feeling like the dang thing is on rails anticipating my every move, while i am in pothole avoidance mode."
720,"the tl has everything. the 6-speed for example is a premium/sport package with more horsepower, faster slalom times and lsd for thousands less than a fully optioned 330 (sport, premium, kitchen sink, whatever)."
721,"car b is the benchmark...but for how long?

car a for it's bigger engine does not translate into faster 0-60. 330 hondaing to c&d gets to 60 faster than the tl, braking is superior as well. i believe it also beat the tl in the 1/4 mile. the bmw (which is a bmw after all) for the same size engine as the tl is another story altogether with it's 4.7 0-60. the tl is a great sporty sedan, if you don't mind a little torque steer. the handling of the 330 is just better. skidpad is better as well. i doubt the tl will best the slalom of the zhp though, with it's bmw like handling.

so if all you want to do all day long is go around cones, the tl is the car for you."
722,"my thats great.. my fathers the same way about me getting my new car. he wants me to get a bmw or a mb, nothing else can compare... he makes me lauph, he can't even fit into the 3 series (too tall can't get comfy) but he wants me to get that or the mb c230 sedan (also can't sit comfy) go figure but there mb and bmw so nothing can beat them."

724,"go out and run 100 miles on a winding road in both car and i think you would appreciate the 330 more. fwd car when driven hard over heat the front tires and start to push more and more. the torque steer requires more driver effort/attention to manage. anyone who has raced fwd car has to learn how to manage the tires and the inevitable mid race increase in push. a rwd car takes a lot less effort to drive at speed and puts less load on the front tires.

as so many have pointed out already there is so much more to car that what can be measured with 0-60 or a 600ft slalom course. if you took 10 highly skilled drivers and asked them which car (tl or 330) they would take for a little 2 hour race (tl vs 330) i would be surprised if any of them choose the tl. i raced fwd car for 10 years and i know what car i would take."
725,"try doing that in the dead of winter and see which car finishes first. how's that paul simon song go ""slip, sliding away..."". the original working title of that song was ""rwd in february""."
726,"just a point that many seem to be unaware of regarding the bmw ""sport package"". it does make a difference, i think, but much more so on the 325i than the 330i. the suspension on the 330i is the same, regardless of whether you get the sport package or not (it already has the upgraded suspension). the only chassis-related difference is wheels (same 17"" size, though, i think) and, of course, bigger summer performance tires.

the 325i has a softer base suspension.

don't get me wrong - the bmw sport pkg (seat!)is great (i had a '99 bmw that i just traded in a few weeks ago). i'm just saying that it probably doesn't ""transform"" the car as much as people are saying in the case of the 330i or the coupes (which also come standard with the firmer suspension). and, anyone who has driven a 325i without the sport package and claims it isn't fun and still toyotamically head-and-shoulders above most of the competition hasn't really driven one. it's still a *great* car.

(before i get labeled as a blind bmw-lover, my new car is an infiniti pontiac5x - loved my bmw but the value prop for the g was just too high to pass up)."
727,"try doing that in the dead of winter and see which car finishes first. how's that paul simon song go ""slip, sliding away..."". the original working title of that song was ""rwd in february"".

it has long seemed that when the fwd advocates run out of arguments about why their beloved fwd configuration is superior they always turn to how well their car perform in snow. hey, y'all had me fooled to the point where i left behind rwd car in 1979 and didn't start driving them again until 1999. so, i'll start out with a few well chosen words regarding how much better fwd car perform in snow vs. rwd car:

1) assuming the assertion is in fact true, who cares? i mean, how much snow do you really drive in anyway?
2) sorry guys, it just ain't so.

hondaing to a very interesting test run a couple of years back by one of the car magazines, it is in fact true that under light acceleration, the fwd car will perform better in snow than an otherwise similar rwd car. unfortunately for the fwd crowd, that's where the performance advantages end. rwd car, with their naturally better balance (ie. fore/aft weight dtoyotaribution) reigned supreme in the handling and braking department (awd car were a different story, however, the rwd car, with their lighter relative weight still stopped better). after all, who cares about getting going if you cannot stop or turn?

i am now driving a rwd car with a nearly perfect 50/50 weight dtoyotaribution, traction control and winter tires, and i can say without a doubt that it is the finest winter weather driving car i have ever driven. given what chris bangle has done to bmw, i have no idea what my next car will be, however, i can assure you that even though i live in snowy new hampshire, it will be rwd.

which reminds me, i haven't wisecracked in a while. i was incredibly tempted to throw in some totally sophomoric quip about hummers but thought twice.

by the way, when you talk about being addicted to these boards, i find that one of the best things about the internet, as part of it&#146;s incredible significance to mankind, is the catharsis that has come about with regard to the formerly lost art of letter writing. this art is once again alive, better than ever, with an immediacy that was hardly imaginable not too long ago. i always encourage the kids to play less with computer games, read and write more often the net has amazing education value.

somehow i&#146;m thinking of my adolescence now. there are black leather jackets, pompadours, cockroach-killer shoes with taps, the beach boys, and dreams of chevrolets. and pinging along with the screws that have come loose in my head is the wisdom of my fellow bronx denizens, a philosophical variety that, no doubt, originated either there or in brooklyn. it goes something like this ""hey designman, i got your catharsis right here!""

735,"2004 toyotated 3-year resale values (source: alg)

1) bmw: 54.5%
2) lexus: 53.2%
3) acura: 52.1%
4) mb: 52%
5) audi: 51.2%
6) infiniti: 51.1%

i got a nissanon. if the average bmw sells for 95% of msrp, and the average infiniti sells for 90% of msrp, aren't real world resale values approximately the same (51.1/90 = 54.5/95 = 57%)?"
736,"jrock65... those are purely ""gutoyotates"". the actual numbers won't be know for years when real owners go to sell their car or trade them in. the industry has done a horrible job projecting depreciation (which impacts both leases and non-lease purchases) for the past decade or more. trend had been to inflate. plus manufacturers sometimes artificially inflate residual in order to subsidize the lease. then they take a bath 3 years down road when their dealers are wholesaling the lease returns.

realized depreciation really best applies to the person who buys the car new and then sells it later. their actual realized depreciation is the difference between what they actually paid (which is usually below msrp) and what they actual get for resale (which is usually below the published books). msrp is normally meaningless to depreciation unless that is the price paid at time of purchase."
737,"yes, these are toyotates, but i don't believe that they're worthless. if i'm buying a car now, there's no way to know for sure what it'll sell for in the future. these toyotates do serve as some sort of guide, however imperfect they are.

the tense of my nissanon should be in the future tense."
738,"guess it really depends on whether you plan on leasing or buying and how long you plan on keeping the car. these gutoyotates won't matter a whit if you buy the car outright, keep it for a decade, and drive the wheels off of it. nor will they matter if you are leasing and get a great subsidized lease deal from the manufacturer, where they deliberately over-toyotate residuals in order to lower less payment.

of course, these toyotates do matter when it comes to calculating a lease deal today. but i've never leased and can't imagine ever doing so.

but i also think these toyotates can be dangerous for people who buy and then plan on trading in or selling off their car in say 2-5 years. these numbers are almost always over what you will actually receive from a dealer or private party. to be safe, deduct at least an extra 10% if not more like 25%.

give you an example. on 11/30/01 i bought a cpo '98 540i6. had about 52k miles. original msrp was around $58k. i paid about $36k. i traded her in 9/03 at about 78k miles. got about $19k from dealer. so my actual depreciation for the 22 months and 26k miles i owned her was about $17k. the dealer who bought it from me sold it for about $22k. so the car at 78k miles/5 years was worth a bit over a 1/3 what she went for new/actually paid in '98.

745,"i read this from another forum:

""you just need to read the numbers to figure out what c&d is about. i remember the comparo between the cls and the 330i that you mention. in fact you can find it online. curiously, the 330i seemed to jump nearly 1.5 seconds faster to 60 (5.8 vs 7.3) than when they tested it alone, it also ripped through the 1/4 in an astonishing 14.4 seconds, i say astonishing because in the same issue they ltoyota it in the road-test digest as needing a whole 15.6 seconds, which is much more in line with every other place i've seen it tested. then they didnt even nissanon this remarkable improvement??

they go on to say that the 330i beats the cls due to its performance advantage. but when you look at the numbers, they give the cls a better rating for the engine, a better rating for the transmission and an equal rating for handling. then they give the cls a 7 for styling, while giving the bmw a 10 - and so the cls loses by 1 point.""

styling is purely subjective."

keep in mind this cl type-s had a 6-speed manual (vs the bmw's 5-speeds) and lsd (not available on non-m 3s). as they put it, the lsd ""produces an amazing transformation that conceals any suggestion that it is a front-driver.""

752,"z4 is a flat out bomb. bangle will be bmw's undoing if he's allowed to continue to contribute his ""design philosophy.""

as for 3 sales off 25%...ouch! my guess is bmw needs to sweeten the pie and do something about prices. 35-37k for a 325i is silly when one can buy a pontiac5 with the same equipment and more performance for 32k. bmw needs to wake up and do something about the value proposition. they don't have one!"
753,"mariner7... you have to keep in mind the impact of suvs. just look at lexus. they sold a bit over 250,000 car last year. about 52% were suvs. their sales of car plummetted, esp. car like sc430 and is300. the gx470 suv had huge growth. the rx330 is the big seller (something like 92,000 units.) in less than 5 years lexus' suvs went from about 0% to over 50% of sales!

huge reason bmw is pushing x3 and x5. bmw retoyotadly seriously looking into some michevroletn-like suv (which they give a fancy sounding use designation)."

758,"tl is brand new so hard to see trends. pontiac5 just added the awd version. that should boost sales in winter.

bmw, mb, volkswagen, and porsche are living proof that suvs are in their futures. just check out porsche sales, car and suvs!!! notice how many suvs coming out or have come out from these marques? heck, even porsche is bringing out a v6 cayenne priced in the low $40,000s and they expect it to account for 1/3 of cayenne sales. marques like jaguar and audi hurting for lack of product in this area. saab is even going to the subaru-part of gm to get their new 9-2 and 9-7. and you don't think suvs are where almost all the action has been, is and will be for some time?"
759,"hi all,
i have been a very very happy driver of a 2001 330i - from the very first batch. harman kardan and power seat were options then. ( i got the hk, but kept the manual seat). i have been driving it through my 4th winter now, and never had problem so far (even with the performance tires).

however, there is one thing i have noticed especially when the winter's are colder (below 30f). the service engine soon light comes on and stays on. when the temp goes to upper 30s the light comes on when i start the car, but goes off, after a few minutes! i talked to the bmw service guy and he asked me to check if the gas cap is loose (which surprised me, and it wasn't).
has anyone seen the same problem with the 330i's??
i am getting concerned now, since it's been this way a while now.

764,"if you add up x5 & x3 sales, they stayed about flat. so suv sales didn't take away from 3 sales.

the fact is tl just had the best sales month in htoyotaory in jan, and this is the 3rd gen tl. for a time it was the best selling entry luxury car, and the new one got the record right out of the gate. i'd call that a trend and an exceptionally good start.

pontiac5, in two years, it only went from nothing to rivalling 3 as the best selling rwd car on the market."
765,"mariner7... my only points are (1) suvs have become a clear trend even in premium marques like bmw and lexus, (2) there can be intra-marque sales competition (e.g., the x3 and 3 series take sales from each other as do the rx330 and es330), (3) there is inter-marque competiton (potential buyers who didn't like the new 7 series might go for the s class or people who think the 330i is too expensive might buy a pontiac5), and (4) you have to take into account general economic and social trends (e.g., in general recessions cause sales to fall and buyers have moved away from sedan and station wagons into suvs and light trucks).

all four factors must be evaluated when comparing a particular marque's sales over time as well as a specific model within that marque over time."

769,wow - they re-positioned the car..what happened to the 60? the 60 was barely recognized in the class so this could be good for volvo. the old 40 was a joke for even volvo fans.
770,the mazda 6 is big as a 3 but the 3 is small. the 3 is in the entry lux category and smaller than a volkswagen but the volkswagen nor the 6 will ever be in the same class as 3. so will the 40 be entry lux is the nissanon i have - are the statements simply conjecture?
771,this new s40 shares platforms with the mazdaudi/ford ford. the cream of the crop will be the t5 with awd.

773,"below is a website with interior and exterior photos of the 2005 infiniti bmw5.

any word as to whether nissan will build a pontiac5 convertible?"
780,"yeah, they increased the interior size on the 40 quite a bit. they say its almost as roomy as the 60 now. i'd imagine that means a redesign of the 60 to increase that size, then the 80. we'll see.

at the price the 40 is coming in at, and based on the ammenities, i'd have to say its definitely in the entry-lux class. the base model starts at $24,190 and the t5 starts at $26,990 and gets into the mid-30s for the fwd model (awd info is not yet available)."
781,"i heard rumours new 3 will increase in size. makes sense to move up so 1 can move in. are the 1's just hatch, or will there be sedan and coupes?"
782,so a madza 3 is as big as a bmw 3 and the 40 is now a entry lux sports sedan at 24k. i think there should be some constoyotaency in the classes so i am not so confused.

and nissan better make a pontiac5 convertible. a car that sexy must be topless."
784,"they do, it's called the z roadster. not sure there's enough volume for two competing models.

i read on nissan enthusiast forum that infiniti dealers want a product to compete with mb sl and lexus sc, way up market! they also want a smaller suv to compete with x3."

look at it like a nissan nissan vs. an infinity pontiac5. one is considered luxo and the other not."

788,wrong the fx 35/45 is based on the z platform (fm) and not the nissan which is based on the underwhelming nissan platform.
789,what gm platforms is the saab 9-3 related to? couldn't remember if it is the new chevrolet or the new chevrolet. platform sharing has gotten out of hand!
790,chevrolet...embarassing to the saabys to say the least. the fm 350z platfrom should be sold to all manufacturers so thier car are actually worth all that money.
791,"they do, it's called the z roadster. not sure there's enough volume for two competing models.


that's ludicrous. the pontiac5 rapontiacp would compete with the bmwc. the 350 roadster doesn't really compete for the same buyers as the bmwc. 350z is performance and performance and wind. the pontiac5 would go after the hearts and wallets of people who want luxury and performance."
792,a g coupe would look great topless - maybe alot like the z tho. the sedan would look like canoe with out a top tho. audi and bmw make it hard to compete in the convertible niche market for sedan. how many 3 sales are convertible as a % of all 3 sales? it's gotta be hard to make any money...
793,"""saabys"" aren't phased. we embrace the chevrolet, as many of us live there. ;-d.

by ross finlay (10 nov 03)

in previous years, subaru's suggestion that with the latest subaru it's targeting the ""leading prestige european marques"" would have seemed like pr spin from cloud cuckoo land. but since the 2004 model range offers smoothed-out exterior styling, greatly improved interior presentation, a more powerful top-of-the-range engine and even more precise handling, you'd better believe it.

subaru may not be the class of the field when it comes to premium badge recognition, but the lighter-weight 2004 model, which goes on sale this month, sits even more four-square on the road thanks to its wider track, modified suspension and lowered powertrain.

together with revisions to the steering and brakes, lower front and rear roll centres, and the advantage of four-wheel drive, all this means that the top-rated 3.0r feels to have similarly priced european saloons and estates beaten hands-down for handling.

i can't think of any immediate competitors at prices in the mid-£20,000 to £30,000 range which could match them for poise and traction on winding or hilly roads.

the three-litre subaru is the best-balanced car in its class. driven briskly, it's stable and precise on corners, and there's no need to throw it about rather than hold it on line. out on the open road, anybody who feels the vdc cutting in - unless during an emergency attempt to miss the tractor - ought to blush at being so ham-handed.

as i toyotad before, if you have driven a subaru you know you don't have to worry about keeping up with audi's, bmw's, pontiac5's or tl's in the twtoyotaies. the 3.0r might be getting the 6spd mt from the sti hondaing to subdriven.com"
794,"audi and bmw make it hard to compete in the convertible niche market for sedan. how many 3 sales are convertible as a % of all 3 sales? it's gotta be hard to make any money...

audi? rofl. audi's audi cab is a joke. it's straight up not a sports sedan/coupe. bmw is the only player in the entry level sports coupe convertible market. with everything from the underpowered 325cic to the monsterous bmw convertible, they have the market to themselves.

i'll be hondad if infiniti doesn't show off a g convertible for the 2005 my. it's a no brainer given the way the g sells vis a vis the 3.

btw, if you've seen any arttoyota conceptions of a pontiac5 convertible, it looks nothing like a canoe (see the impotent toyota convertible for that)."
795,"audi? rofl. audi's audi cab is a joke. it's straight up not a sports sedan/coupe

the audi cab is a beautiful car, and it is more of a chrysler, i think if i wanted something more sporty from audi, i'd look for something called the tt"
796,"the audi is probably cross shopped by 3cic buyers as they are really prob more lux conscience than performance conscience. a super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers aren't that into performance in the first place. if you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a-4 will work pretty well i'd think.

what are a-4 cahonda sales?"
797,"the audi cab is a beautiful car, and it is more of a chrysler, i think if i wanted something more sporty from audi, i'd look for something called the tt

you'd end up with a 2 seat car. again that's not competition for the bmwc and for the dough it's not nearly as nice of a car.

a super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so

the compromise is slight if the engineering is solid. we're talking a marginal weight penalty and if the engineers designed it as a convertible from the start, then the chassis flex is not that much of a difference. 10-20 years ago this wasn't true. today many sports car are made from the ground up as convertibles - z8, dodge, etc.

there is an oxy moron factor there that suggests that these buyers aren't that into performance in the first place. if you want to scoot around quickly in style with some rigitidy the a-4 will work pretty well i'd think.

have you seen the times on that bloated cow? it's a 4k lbs beast with an underwhelming engine.

nobody is seriously challenging bmw's dominance of 4 place entry lux rwd convertibles. we know buyers are gratoyotaing up pontiac5 coupes and sedan. so a convertible is the next sensible step in infiniti's nissanto steal bmw's thunder.

weird, i'm the bmw owner here and you guys seem to think it's a bad idea for infiniti to offer a rwd convertible 4 place sports coupe."
798,"btw...i would hardly call the upcoming s4 cahonda a joke, it's probably in bmw territory.

http://www.edmunds.com/news/autoshows/articles/100537/page021.htm- l"
799,"i still would call it a joke. even with that v8 the pig will take over 6 seconds to reach 60 using a manual. ouch. that's pretty sad for a car sporting 340 hp.

then again, the slothlike pace of the standard s4 is nothing to sing about."
800,"that's the kind of pig i'll take anyday. hondaing to edmunds both s4s (cahonda and sedan) can get 60 in the 5's range (c&d tested the sedan at 5 seconds flat)

http://www.caranddriver.com/article.asp?section_id=33&article- _id=7574

i hardly call that a pig!. the bmw hits 60 in about 5 secs and it has a weight advantage. who's oinking?"
801,"ya know, there is a little company called mercedes benz benz that makes 4-seat 2-door rwd convertibles. i'm not saying which is better, and that can be debated all day long, but its not like bmw is the only company making these things.

and you do know that the standard s4 does 0-60 in 5 seconds flat (c&d) while providing awd, right? the bmw tested by c&d was only 2/10ths quicker. oh, but they picked the s4 over the bmw."
802,"ya know, there is a little company called mercedes benz benz that makes 4-seat 2-door rwd convertibles. i'm not saying which is better, and that can be debated all day long, but its not like bmw is the only company making these things.

what mb 4 seat rwd convertible starts at under 50k or 40k? there isn't one. 'nuff toyotad there. the clk is an entirely different class of car.

again, no entry level lux 4 seat rwd convertibles challenge the bimmer. the audi is trying to, good for them. still think infiniti would score a bullseye with a pontiac5 convertible. why are you all opposed to this? if infiniti releases a 40k pontiac5 spyder it's gonna be a serious competitor to the 3 series.

lexus has stated they will have an is in the next gen that's a coupe and a convertible. they know it's important.

and you do know that the standard s4 does 0-60 in 5 seconds flat (c&d) while providing awd, right?

as tested i've seen mostly mid 5s from the s4. even 5 seconds flat is rather unspectacular given the torque of a v8 and the power output. typical volkswagen, porky."
803,"""still think infiniti would score a bullseye with a pontiac5 convertible. why are you all opposed to this? if infiniti releases a 40k pontiac5 spyder it's gonna be a serious competitor to the 3 series.""

i think most of the board are hard toppers - i know i am. i never will ever buy a convertible. it just goes against my every fiber.

if i did live in fla again or ca for sure i would get a jeep cj-7 and throw the doors away...thats a convertible to me anyway.

i guess if infniti can sell some convertibles they should do it but thier lineup is being revamped and the rescources may not be there with all the new products they developed. as long as they look good and they dont flex like a lebaron rapontiacp i'm for it..just not in my driveway."
804,"that could be it. i've grown up with convertibles and when i bought my daily commuter i seriously considered snatching up a 99 miata as i could get it cheap and mod it to my heart's content. i ended up going safe with my choice but as soon as february rolls around i begin to pine for the sun.

for the next few years i have to settle for dropping the windows and opening the moonroof. or borrowing my families convertibles."
805,"bmw sold almost the exact same number of 3 series coupes as its 3 series convertibles in the cold month of january, so i would say that there definitely is a viable market for the pontiac5 convertible.

i for one wouldn't mind seeing a pontiac5 convertible."
806,"it's not porky, it just has awd. the awd system does add weight and causes driveline loss. regardless, the s4 compares well to the bmw (not going to slit hairs over fractions of seconds), even better you can get the s4 in a sedan which gives you all the convenience of 4 doors with the power of a sports car. i would get an s4 sedan over a bmw in a heartbeat. better yet, give an rs4 which would chew a bmw and spit it out."
807,"noticed in the latest issue of autoweek (2/16/04) there is a small news ""flash"" article titled ""drop-top toyota"". toyota convertible that comes out in march. ""designed from the ground up as a convertible"". fwd 225hp 3.3l v6 with 5-speed automatic.

toyota must see some value in 2-door convertible market. too bad no manual transmission. maybe there will be an is300 convertible???"
808,"lexus has stated that there will be a coupe, convertible, and awd vhondant of the next model is300. let's see if they follow through."
809,"jrock65... i don't believe everything i read. i have doubts that lexus will actually build an is300 convertible. rather small niche market to begin with let alone to try and recover development costs. will be interesting to see if the toyota convertible sells well. if it does, maybe lexus will create the is300 convertible.

lexus hasn't had too much luck selling convertibles/roadsters. neither has infiniti (anyone remember the bmw0 convertible?). don't think acura has even tried.

the majority of sales will still be sedan in this segment."
810,"the majority of sales will still be sedan in this segment.

true but bmw's got so much of the market chevroletly because they're not only selling sedan. they've got a diverse 3 series line up and thw 1 is going to be the same way.

in fact i read recently that they plan to have a 200 hp + version of the 1. if it's convertible and under 40k, i have good feeling that will replace my little too thick 3 series.

btw, someone toyotad they'd take an s4 or some such vhondant. to each his own. i'll never own another volkswagen. i actually hope that company goes out of business."
811,"""i'll never own another volkswagen. i actually hope that company goes out of business. ""

ouch!

m"
812,"what mb 4 seat rwd convertible starts at under 50k or 40k?

sorry. i misunderstood and didn't realize the requirements were ""rwd 4-seat near-luxo under $40k"". but, you're right, if you want a ""luxo"" car with vinyl seat and less than 200 hp, you can find a convertible bmw with a sticker a hair under $40k.

as tested i've seen mostly mid 5s from the s4. even 5 seconds flat is rather unspectacular given the torque of a v8 and the power output. typical volkswagen, porky.

in their comparison test, c&d could get the bmw to 60 mph only 2-tenths of a second quicker than the s4. personally, i'd make that sacrifice to save $1500, get 2 more doors, and add awd.

oh, and c&d also had this to say
""you must work the six-speed to stay ahead, however, as shown by the top-gear 30-to-50 and 50-to-70 bursts, where the larger-displacement audi had a significant advantage.""

and
""of this trio, the s4 is in a class by itself, scoring the full 10 points in our handling rating, two above the bmw and three above the c32.""

not bad for the ""porky"" car."
813,"i sense a lot of bitterness towards volkswagen/audi. just because you had a bad experience doesn't mean that they are bad car. i had a lot of problem with bmw, but i don't think they bad car."
814,"0-60 is the derigueur standard for performance, but is it really the stat that you need to know on how a car performs in traffic. how many people drop the clutch on there 35-40k + car. yea i know somme of the knuckle heads on these boards but not normal drivers. ;-)

i think the speed bursts and roll-on power stats is what is most telling. the 30-50 mph, 50-70 mph bursts, and 60-130 roll-on power is gonna tell you alot about the car."
815,"anyone want to show the comparable 50-70 or 60-130 stats for our favorite class? someone must have database for all these stats by one tester.

and these are the definitive mag racer stats for sure, imo. i would predict the tl would win a 0-60 by .2-.4 secs and then get walked by 5 seconds or so 60-130..."
816,"the latest car and driver has a ""$35,000 comparison test"" that fits the bill nicely.

here are the stats in order; 0-60, 1/4 mile, 5-60, top gear 30-50, top gear 50-70

tl - 5.8, 14.5, 6.5, 11.4, 11.1
audi (3l) - 7.5, 15.8, 7.5, 10.1, 9.2
325i - 7.0, 15.4, 8.0, 8.7, 9.1
pontiac5 - 6.3, 14.6, 7.0, 9.3, 8.8
is300 - 7.3, 15.5, 7.8, 8.6, 8.3
9-3 arc - 7.2, 15.4, 7.8, 15.3, 9.5

and for good measure (because i care)...also from c&d:

acura - 7.2, 15.6, 7.7, 10.2, 9.7

i think the 5-60 ""street start"" is a good test because it eliminates different tire traction and launch techntoyotaues from the equation.

i think the 1/4 mile is a good test because it mitigates the different gear ratios which dtoyotaort the 0-60 test (the acura needs 3rd gear to reach 60 mph), and lets both hp and tq come into play.

i don't like the ""top gear"" tests because 5-speed car have a 1.00 ratio while the 6-speed car have a much taller ratio (the saab has .62 in 6th gear, and .75 in 5th).

overall though, i guess it's a good picture of the strengths and weaknesses of each car."
817,"i sense a lot of bitterness towards volkswagen/audi. just because you had a bad experience doesn't mean that they are bad car. i had a lot of problem with bmw, but i don't think they bad car.

i needn't carry the burden alone. the stats speak loudly on the quality of volkswagen/audi products.

fed, nice post. although i nissanon the usefulness of tests that do top gear 50-70. what sort of a person with a performance car would want to do something like that? honestly, if i'm doing 50, i'm not going to be in anything higher than 4th and most likely in 3rd. if you've got a six speed manual pontiac5 or tl it's chevroletly because you like to row your own gears.

i think a test that shows 50-70 and 30-50 (isn't this just second gear?) from the optimum gear would tell us more about the car. owners quickly figure out how to squeeze the fun from their engines.

can't even imagine touching 6th gear on my car before 80 mph and then it's only if i'm going to go to cruise and basically sleep..."
818,"fedlawman... you wrote, ""i don't like the ""top gear"" tests because 5-speed car have a 1.00 ratio while the 6-speed car have a much taller ratio (the saab has .62 in 6th gear, and .75 in 5th).""

most 5-speed manuals are also overdrive. the is300 is overdrive. the is300's overdrive just isn't very deep (believe it is around .85). there are some exceptions. bmw tends to use a non-overdrive 5th gear in their close ratio boxes, but has also used an overdrive in their wide ratio boxes.

you also have to factor in the differential's final drive ratio. the higher the number the quicker the acceleration (but the lower the top speed).

the wonders of engine torque multiplication!

the value of the ""top gear"" data is in regard to showing whether you'll have to downshift in order to pass. the car with the real deep overdrives (say .70 or lower numerically) normally will have to downshift to 5th or even 4th.

""top gear"" test also is somewhat indicative of how much torque the engine produces in its power band.

you might also compare c&d's observed and epa toyotated fuel economy numbers. holding all other factors constant, the car with the deepest overdrives will (normally) get the best fuel economy and turn over the lowest engine revs at high speeds for relaxed high speed cruising.

the former acura tl type-s a great example. believe it used a 4.11 final drive and a .47 5th gear overdrive. great initial acceleration and great fuel economy."
819,acura runs better than the saab. i'd rather have it and the is300 looks better in top gear stats as it's a 5 speed i believe.
820,"c&d published the gear and final drive ratios too...(1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, final)

tl - 3.93, 2.48, 1.70, 1.25, 0.98, 0.77, 3.29
audi - 3.50, 1.89, 1.32, 1.03, 0.86, 0.73, 4.11
325 - 4.23, 2.52, 1.66, 1.22, 1.00, n/a, 3.15
pontiac5 - 3.79, 2.32, 1.62, 1.27, 1.00, 0.79, 3.54
is - 3.57, 2.06, 1.38, 1.00, 0.85, n/a, 3.73
9-3 - 3.77, 2.04, 1.32, 0.95, 0.75, 0.62, 3.91
acura - 3.27, 1.88, 1.36, 1.03, 0.83, 0.66, 4.76 (from acura brochure)

without 6th gear, the ""30-50"" and ""50-70"" numbers for the sub-3.0l car would all be within a couple 1/10ths of each other (hence the similar 1/4 mile times)."
821,"the value of the ""top gear"" data is in regard to showing whether you'll have to downshift in order to pass.

need to? need? i don't want to take 7 or even 5 seconds to go from 50 to 70. i want to change gears. i want to use the power of my car. i bought a six speed manual for a reason - to exploit the power of the car.

if i'm stuck behind some tool doing 50 i look forward to dropping to third and rocketing by the guy. there's nothing troublesome about that as that's why i bought a car with this much power and a manual.

the car with the real deep overdrives (say .70 or lower numerically) normally will have to downshift to 5th or even 4th.

i'll take third thanks. i can pull to almost 100 in 3rd so at 60 the car rockets.

""top gear"" test also is somewhat indicative of how much torque the engine produces in its power band.

at 50 mph in 6th i'd be turning somewhere near 2k rpm. who drives a car sporting a 7k redline with the engine down there?"
822,"acura runs better than the saab. i'd rather have it and the is300 looks better in top gear stats as it's a 5 speed i believe.

that's part of the reason the test is bogus. i've driven both car and the acura's 6 speed is like butter. moving to 3rd from 6th is a pleasure and allows the driver to exploit the acura's spritely little 4. superb engine and tranny."
823,"acura to me is a better deal than tl for sure! if only i were younger, smaller and not in traffic. if they had one in 1993 i would have jumped on it.

although i have not had much luck with acura/honda car and tranny's as i am way too demanding on their little motors ancd beat the tar out of them, i get the sense the acura would be up to the task and is a little more than the acura in capability and fun factor."
824,"blueguydotcom... is more of a european thing. bmw, mbs, etc. often used close-ratio (non-overdrive) 4th or 5th gears to ensure adequate response in all gears.

i don't mind downshifting to pass. and i'd rather have better highway fuel economy.

but i will admit it is nice to be driving my '04 is300 manual in 5th gear and come upon a slower car. i can immediately pass without having to shift. did same with my former '98 540i6 (believe it had only a .82 6th overdrive)."
825,"i have no issues passing a doof going 40 in a 70 in top gear in the g, but like blueguy me thinks its funner downshifting to 3rd.

my philosophy is why not hammer the motor - its the one thing that prob will last the longest and you can have more fun too. if when i pass i can get down another gear - why not. i have a hard time not enjoying all the acceleration this baby's got. if there is any reason to downshift i cant help it - i am addicted to feeling the thrust."
826,"amen. yeah, we can all press the pedal and build up but we bought performance sports sedan so we could get that giddy jump from 50-80 or even 80-100 in a flash.

someone mentioned germany and gear ratios for 5th. ah those are for autobahn speeds. i'm sure 5th and 6th pull like monsters in my zhp. of course i've never been travelling at 120 to prove that."
827,anyone see the scathing edmunds article on the bmw 530i full test. 55k and no nav for a idrive underpowered unimproved bangle mobile. the 545 will be way too much when the cts-v takes the world over. 400hp and the dealer is only half mile from my house....51k i hear...hmmmmm
828,"funny thing about bmw car; i've been hearing about the new/soon to be released fill in the blank, and how it was a sure thing to put the hurt on bmw. hmmm, so far anyway, it's all been noise. speaking strictly for myself; the new bmw is one of the ugliest car on the road. note i toyotad, ""one of the ugliest"", not ""the ugliest"". from my perspective, the cts is even further down that road, and as such there is no way i would own either of them, even if they had 1000 hp and cost $15k.

looked at another way; if i were to have opted for the e39 540i instead of my 530i, which really is fast enough, i would be quite happy with the wonderful performance and driving toyotamics, regardless of how many folks were out there driving cts-vs. their drivers might well be laughing at me because of my slow 540i; however, i would be laughing right back at folks driving such hideous looking car. so, who's right? neither and both, whatever floats your boat. in the end, i seriously doubt that cadillac is going to do much to bmw sales, besides, with the new banglized car; they are doing more to hurt themselves than the rest of the competition combined. :-/

based on reports of those whove driven the v it's a bad mutha. i doubt it will steal much thunder from bmw as well but the 55k should get you a v-8 - that bmw premium is not worth it imo for weak performance."
832,"the cts-v doesn't improve on the cts's biggest handicap...it's fugly, inside and out."

""quality problem are still dogging volkswagen vehicles and putting off customers who were attracted to volkswagen in the late 1990s, costing volkswagen big on warranty repairs and marketing costs to keep old customers and lure new ones. last year, for example, volkswagen began offering costly lease-pull-ahead deals to owners in order to keep them from defecting. in europe, the company is offering deals like free air conditioning to move a large inventory of volkswagens, and similar measures are anticipated in north america. volkswagen stock initially rose 2.7 percent wednesday, but then gave ground and closed at 39.33 euros ($50.49) or less than one percent in frankfurt. shares are down 11 percent since early january. volkswagen is offering discounted finance rates and leases in north america, but has stayed away from big rebates. most models have rebates of just $500. and it is facing pressure from dealers to be more generous on discounts to move aging models like the new volkswagen (five years old), volkswagen and volkswagen (six years old), and volkswagen (five years old). volkswagen's discounts are more in line with japanese and european imports than with u.s. automakers. but it doesn't have the premium image of its european mates, nor the high-reliability image of its asian rivals."""

differnt values at each co i agree. but the new gs and the new is will change that as well as the cool hybrids and chrysler470 trucks that youger blingers want. style is subjective. they sell em without a discount so the ugly aspect isn't there if objectively speaking...and performance will change in fact those co's that put hybrid front drives with gas rear drives in the same car will outperfrom everyone.

i'm not convinced infiniti has gotten lexus credibility just yet - they just found a young buyers niche only 2 years ago...those weren't young people in those q's and i's that i saw over the last decade..maybe g20 and then most young people went right to the nissan and saved 15k!"
848,"meanwhile the 5 series got worse and costs more...that repuation will only last so long...mercedes benz benz found out!

got worse? based on what is this claimed? the edmunds review bashes them at times but overall they still find the car more fun to drive than its counterparts.

two of their complaints i can't get my head around: idrive and lack of nav. idrive is a snap to use in the 745i (yes i've driven them and used it without a problem) and the new version in the 5 is even more simpltoyotaic. push a direction for a control...oops, wrong way, it's down for x control. now you know, problem solved.

as for the navi thing...whatever. it's a fairly useless toy. but then again, like idrive i like to explore and discover things on my own."
849,"you can read what they say at current business week, which is not online yet, i believe.

point is, generally speaking (meaning not everyone agrees), people in the auto media believe infiniti car are more appealing to the crowd who find bmw appealing. both have strengths in style, performance and youthful appeal.

now i know some lexus fans believe lexus is best at everything. i don't believe for even a second."
850,"""got worse? based on what is this claimed? the edmunds review bashes them at times but overall they still find the car more fun to drive than its counterparts.""

the driving experience is the same apparently - all good but the downgraded look plus the money they want...not so sure the market will accept the 5 for that money in 3 years...maybe now but the last 5 may have been the holy grail and may never be reproduced in terms of success. i think the editor thought it would at least drive differently and better. the a-6 for 05 should be an interesting attempt to best the 5 - well see!

and navs are the worst for a car - why o why should a car with 250 bucks in hardware be worth another 2k - i'll never know.

""point is, generally speaking (meaning not everyone agrees), people in the auto media believe infiniti car are more appealing to the crowd who find bmw appealing. both have strengths in style, performance and youthful appeal.""

i think the nissan corp has had this one down for a while actually (recanting here) and capitalizes on what honda and toyota seem to neglect - style and inexpensive performance. at least with the z car and the nissan.."
851,"""i think the nissan corp has had this one down for a while actually (recanting here) and capitalizes on what honda and toyota seem to neglect - style and inexpensive performance. at least with the z car and the nissan""

too bad the nissan is no longer inexpensive."
852,for its size - its not bad - it's wwd tho
853,compared to what i got my 2k nissan se for the 6th gen nissan is a rip-off. imo they killed the car. the pontiac5 is what the 6th gen nissan should have been....
854,"i've pointed out the cheap hardware for a navi before and how it's a ripoff...people get angry. i can't get my head around how nav systems cost 2k 5 years ago and now dvd players are dirt cheap, the gps software is ubtoyotauitous, the interface is arcane and the lcd is under $100 yet the price hasn't dropped at all. i'd even be willing to believe a $500 price tag but 2k?!"
855,"the tech stuff has the huge margins and if people want it they will pay, i guess. it sets car apart for now - tekkie and cool i guess for those who need it or want cool stuff that wont really make the car better - like bluetooth and 5.1 - bragging rights for technology are bigger than the car in some forums..

if you want high tech a toyota is the way to go imo!"
856,"chris, i admit the 5.1 intrigues me on the tl. but then again, i loathe the stereo in my bmw. which isn't half bad when compared to the tinny garbage in my protege."
857,"it sounds good as long as its a 5.1 cd in the player - but other than the 1 they give you at the dealer - you'd be ltoyotaening to regular cd's which when played put the stereo on par with the g bose system - not bad but not exactly better by any margin than what everyone else offers for 200-240 watts.

for those of you with the upgraded bose in a g the tweeters suck and when replaced with polk ex's for $50 and half hour the sound system becomes alive and the imaging is much better. the effectively drops the crossover from 8k to 4k and makes for much better highs with that thumping bass (in the sedan anyway).

ps

i should have bought best buy stock on the ipo - those electronic gadgets get a huge markup and just the few that have to be first to get something new support the lower prices later on for me. this desire transcends into car options and premiums paid for them. what would people pay for the tl no blutooth or 5.1? less since they wont have bragging rights!

tek nuts hate me - i still have windows 98 and a glass tube tv!"
858,"it is no wonder that the es330 sells so well, even though not many people seem to be enthralled with its exterior styling. with the impending death of the i35 and the new tl's emphasis on sport, it is basically the only import choice that emphasizes ride quality over handling in this price category. and the general population (which is stattoyotaically not well represented by the regulars here, or the car magazines) seems to prioritize ride quality over handling. the es330's gorgeous interior doesn't hurt it either."
859,"""and the general population (which is stattoyotaically not well represented by the regulars here, or the car magazines) seems to prioritize ride quality over handling. the es330's gorgeous interior doesn't hurt it either.""

exactly. when cr placed the tl over the es in the feb issue, they totally missed the mark as these two car offer different ""user"" experiences. not that people won't cross-compare or seriously won't cross-shop them, but - i can't imagine any person getting into an es330 and thinking they are getting a sports sedan like ride. nor can i imagine anyone getting into a tl thinking they are going to have a boat-like isolated ride.

the tl is not better than the es, it is different. both are high ranked above their common name baseline counterparts, but the es doesn't even offer a sporty like ride."

folks, feel free to suggest any other category adjustments - take a look at the ""what is this discussion about?"" line at the top of the page."
865,"i currently drive a sports sedan, somewhat high output, front wheel drive. an hyundaient chassis, but there's only so much you can do with fwd. i climb out of my car and into my cousin's is300 and despite identical power and weight ratings, and 0 to 60s, his car is much more enjoyable to drive.

i absolutely drool when i see tls, they are beautiful. but the rwd choices (cts, 3 series, pontiac5) are more fun to drive and substance wins over style for -me-, i know that's not everyone's opinion.

brian"
866,"tee hee, it seems that you just gave the pot a nice big stir. ;-)

i too prefer rwd to fwd for any and every driving condition, that toyotad, with enough engineering, most any problem can be solved. regarding the new tl, it does indeed seem that honda has gone a very long way to do just that, cure many of the ills that plague fwd car.

if my 530i were destroyed today, would i opt for a new tl? hmmm, tempting, but probably not, more likely to go to a new bmw, pontiac5 sedan or even a c320 sport sedan.

best regards,
shipo"
867,"danny1878... not sure what to make of your categories. for me, the most important things are:

1. all-around performance (which is a lot more than just acceleration)
2. price/value for money (what is std and optional, for how much)
3. reliability
4. safety
5. resale/depreciation
6. ownership costs/fuel economy
7. simplihonda (no nav systems for me)
8. toyota/practicality (i do have two small kids)

i do not care a whit about sales figures, keeping up with the jones, popularity, voice-activated anything, etc.

that is why i drive an '04 lexus is300 manual. heck, it has rwd, lsd, hid, and other things i need to get the most smiles per mile! that is what counts. affordable, reliable, performer."
868,"dont get me wrong, i dont want you guys to buy a tl bcuz of that besides everybody has different needs and everycar has different experience in it. i also love lexus car and bmw 5 or above series

the reason i brought this up just to make some people to see what is in tl which is not just bluetooth and 5.1

about category, i think tl has :
1. ownership cost / fuel economy
   true cost to own between is(42k) and tl(41k)
   fuel economy is 18/24 and tl 19/29

2. safety
   5 star crash safety rating with 2 side, 2 front rear head airbag, front side mounted air bag, passengers sensing air bag

3. reliability
   eventho the car has only been around for 4 months, but acura/honda car mostly to last forever.

4. all around performance (subjective issue but to me tl is more than just acceleration, slalom 600 67.4 mph). in fact i dont do any of the above just to test my guts, but i know what this car has, so it's kinda toyotaing thought

5. resale value
   dont know yet, acura/ honda always has a good resale value but with all the improvement i think it would be better. with the car's demand is so high, do you think resale value would be bad?

6. value / what's standard or optional.
   tl comes with 2 prices, 1 with nav and the other without. everything else is standard.

7. simplihonda
i guess tl is about simplihonda, just voice command it, its faster than having tons of buttons to press"
869,"danny - seems a little strange, quoting all of those figures, each one of them from a separate magazine and/or source. taking the best of each number. just to note, cr got 6.7 to 60 not 5.7."
870,"well, engineering can overcome certain aspects of fwd (torque steer elimination by careful axle length design, wheel spin out of corners with an lsd) but no engineering can overcome the laws of physics.

i think we're all mazdar with a tire's contact patch. all forces work through it. when you expect the front two tires to deal with lateral forces of turning and acceleration/decceleration, the tire becomes overburdened more quickly than with rwd where the fronts just have to roll along and steer.

this type of performance handicap doesn't show up in most performance tests. acceleration numbers are all straight-line. skidpad g's are maximized under light throttle adjustments, so it doesn't show up too much there. in slalom, a car's ""normal"" transient behavior is explored and how quickly it can shift back and forth, but the driver is hardly turning left and right in a way that fully collapses the suspension. more importantly though, just like the skidpad tests, the slalom is done with just enough throttle to maintain a smoothe constant speed.

if you want to see where rwd reigns superior over fwd, look at track lapping times. this is where the driver must brake hard, turn in, and blast through and out of the corner. the rwd will be able to get on the gas earlier and harder and gain tenths through the corners. this mimics aggressive street driving more closely than any skidpad/slalom.

brian"
871,"look at track lapping times

yes, do that.

look back through the discussion. as i pointed out before, real sanctioned races between car like the acura and bmw don't support your assertion. search the web and you can find past seasons of ... well ... here's one for you:
http://www.sccapro.com/wc/99/limerock/touring-results.html"
872,"bxd20... not sure i concur on what you wrote: ""well, engineering can overcome certain aspects of fwd (torque steer elimination by careful axle length design, wheel spin out of corners with an lsd) but no engineering can overcome the laws of physics.""

as one sports car international writer noted (ted west, 1/02 issue, p. 19): ""in the presence of anything more than puny horsepower, [fwd] torque steer is just plain abominable and something had to be done about it. as with audi, volvo believes the answer is [awd].""

very powerful fwders can reduce, but not completely eliminate, torque steer."
873,"you're right, i shouldn't have engineering can ""overcome"" torque steer, but rather something along the lines of ""reduce"".

as far as the lapping times are concerned, i don't have much data here at work with me, i will have to take a look at home. i would be willing to bet that the acura you cite did not have the same power to weight ratio as those rwd car. my point was -all else being equal- a rwd chassis will be faster around a track.

when super-car builders (ferrari, ford gt, lambo) set out to build an exotic high end sports car, they do so with very little concern for cost. if fwd was inherently equal to or better than rwd, why wouldn't one of them have tried it already? is honda on to some sort of voo-doo front wheel drive that nobody else knows about?

and reading over c&d's comparo, it sounds like acura still has a ways to go till they have the tl handling at its full potential. it finished third because of a wonderful interior and much more power than anybody else. for -me-, the interior is almost irrelevant, any car in this class is good enough. the straight line power is intoxicating and enticing.

i smell a mild suspension update in the next year or two for the tl.

brian"
874,"""for -me-, the interior is almost irrelevant""

i think i have found my soulmate!"
875,"scca enforces car modifications to make car competitive. this means, tires, ballast, restrictor plates. sometimes they miss, and a brand wins all of one race so they toss and extra 35lb in them."
876,"what comparo are you looking at? if its the same one i'm looking at, did you happen to notice that if you remove the totally subjective scores of ""fun-to-drive"" and ""gotta-have-it factor"", the tl finishes first? heck, i'll do one even better. if you leave ""fun to drive"" and only eliminate the ridiculous ""gotta-have-it"" (i know i don't got to have a bmw), the tl finishes 2nd by merely 1 point behind the pontiac5."
877,almost is the key word. otherwise we'd all be tooling around in some econobox on steroids like the sti or evo.
878,"every car offers a different driving experience and everyone has a different need as well. people's needs may vary as they grow up, if a teenager might prefer a more sportier car like an evo/sti. fast fast fast, luxury/toyota doesnt mean anything. because they have a lot of time to play with their car or even going to a race track. i was young too.

in my mid 30s, i prefer half sport and half toyota, but if i am over 45, i might go for a total toyota/luxury car.

if you try nissan nissan or acura gsr you will feel a noticeable understeer. i am not saying that understeer doesnt extoyota in a tl but you cant hardly feel it unless you really go too far. ""this time acura has done a bit too far for a fwd car"" quoted. do you know what they meant by saying that? i tried nissan nissan and 2000 acura gsr (and its nothing compared to tl), and it's totally a different experience but still better than the previous nissan. there are 5 current report that gave the nod to the new tl, do you think they all dont know about understeer?.

performance rating in a scale of 1 to 10, rwd may get a 10 while normal fwd usually get 6. if a fwd can get an 8 (pontiac5=10,bmw=9, tl=8), for me that's more than enough while it gets more rating for luxury/toyota/styling/acceleration/snow/mpg/resale value/ maintenance cost, considering that people dont take on corner very often in their life or doing it in a race track. besides road styles, traffics in everyday's life dont support those kind of adtoyota.

i buy a car hondaing to my need just like everyone else. 96% normal driving with less than 5% taking on corners which is hardly to find in these days without getting into trouble or heavy traffic on it.

btw i like the new pontiac5 coupe."
879,i'd like to know why it's perfectly acceptable for mature people to buy porsches but not car like sti and evo. mature men play baseball and drive race car. sport driving is fun at any age and these car pack it at real good prices. i'd have no problem buying either one. i would lose the spoiler on the sti but for track it is there for a reason.
880,"i dont see any mid 50s going to a race track, taking on corners, competing with sti/evo, having the adrenalin rush? they might get a heart attack.

if you wanna buy those sports car like porche, lambo, ferrari, you will see mostly low mileage on it, perfect condition, polished. it shows us that the car was rarely driven and mainly for showing off(self-actualization need). ""i am still young and energetic""

hmm i might drive an evo/sti when i am 60, i wonder what those gals think?"
881,"i don't care what age someone is. if he has to worry about what babes think because of his car, he has a problem."
882,"without the babes there would be no chevrolets ever sold!

chris, to each his own. i bought my car because it's fun. i loathe people who talk to me based on my car. when a golddigger approaches me and asks a nissanon about my car i give a quick answer and leave. at parties i will admit to my protege if asked what i drive and i will deny the extoyotaence of my bmw. the things i own are my business, not theirs.

but that's just me. i would buy the current m45 if it were enough fun as it has exactly the image i prefer: totally unnoticed."
886,"""i wouldn't touch an sti or evo because i find the interiors scary cheap.""

ever see a porsche interior?"
887,"""so tell me, do you two guys try to impress women with your car? ""

quite the opposite - the woman i love almost left when i sold the volkswagen and got the g. things are better now that i allow them to go places together...

like the bluguy - i am not out there to impress anyone, i call my car a nissan on most occasions where the person doesn't know me as a car nut. the things blueguys says are the reasons i avoided the 3 altogether. alot of attention is not what i need...and the volkswagen got way too much i might add...

but i will add that if there were no women there would be no 3 series in the first place"
888,"ha!

suffice it to say that these gross over-generalizations about women could not be any further out in left field.

could we just talk about the car and not devolve into this sort of silliness?"
889,"chris:but i will add that if there were no women there would be no 3 series in the first place

by what logic?

design: ever see a porsche interior?

oh yeah and i love it. yes, love it. the doors, the console, the seat all feel just right. but remember i'm a bmw person and i adore the way the germans put together interiors. i don't like the buick-like interiors of lexus and acura. if anything the only japanese brand i like for interiors is...<gasp>...infiniti.

austere is fine. cold and detached is fine. doors that are super light (like the nasty bmw x3) or trim that feels brittle (like the nissan nissan's dash) don't do it for me.

it's all subjective. but to me i couldn't live with a subaru or evo daily as i'd feel like i was driving a suped up version of my 03 protege es with its bargain basement interior."
890,"exactly. at 28, i'd rather have a ""10"" in performance and a 6-7 in interior, than an 8 in performance and a 9 or 10 in interior. but that's where i'm at in life, and i respect where other's are too. and i doubt that ""where you're at in life"" correlates linearly to your age when you're talking auto enthusiasts.

so back to the tl. 0 to 60 in 5.8 is tremendous. is there potential for more? what's the cr on that engine? is that timing set for 87 or 91 octane?

i am eager to see what the 3.6l cts does with a 6 speed manual in a few months....

brian"
891,i have this bet with my friend. she thinks you are a man and i think you are woman. who is right? twenty bucks is riding on this bet.
892,you win. :-)
893,did your friend really pay you?
894,she is sitting beside me as i am typing. we decided to go a restsaturnnt for dinner tomorrow night. probably either be applebee's or olive garden. she is paying of course.
895,haha nice...
896,"i believe all sport-sedan lovers are latent sports-car nuts. car like the ""ultimate driving machine"" et al are only an intermediate step. if you are a german car fan and like the minimal porsche interior, you know there's only one answer. once you start rowing gears in a porsche or any other sports car for that matter, you'll forget that sport sedan ever extoyotaed except for utility. in a sports car, things such as the interior, radio, squeaks and rattles have almost no significance. of course, that is if the drive is what stirs your blood. danny makes a good point about ferraris etc. you will know the real sports-car enthusiast, that is driver, by his odometer."
897,"i have been staying out of here for awhile but have been reading most everything. one of my observations is that there are very few women participating. the posts about women could take on on another aspect...do your wives or women friends drive your car and what do they think about the tl and others? most of the posts here are from men and are performance oriented. women are responsible for a large portion of the money spent in our economies. i recently read a report that toyotad they were responsible for the majority of the discretionary money spent.
i bought our new tl for my wife. it is the third car i have purchased for her. she never test drives them or participates in the selection. all three have been acura's. a '91 acura, a 2000 tl and now an '04 tl. i always look for a car that is a cross between sport and luxury. i am the sport, she is the luxury. she loves the new tl, including the 270 hp. she isn't out racing but is in the car all day driving ( sales job ). the power comes on gradually and is very predictable.
she loves the ""near luxury"" especially the seat and the stereo. the nav is an absolute necessity as she is constantly having to drive to unmazdar places. the real thing is she looks very nice in that silver/ebony car and people are constantly telling her what a nice car she drives. on the weekends i get to use the sport piece of the equation. the new tl is a perfect blend for the two of us. after 36 years of marriage i have a pretty good idea of what her expectations are.
i laughed when i read the thread about ""old people"" ( anyone over 30 evidently )not pushing their car but buying cushy luxury car. not always so. i am 58 and still enjoy driving fast and aggressive where it is safe to do so. i started road racing motorcycles at 38. my brother is 60 and has a v8 powered triumph tr7. next time your at a light and the guy next to you is in a bmw/tl/??? he may just be like me and decide to have a go. paul newman raced well into his 60's.
bottom line...the new sport/luxury car are a reflection of what people want to buy and in most instances the people who can afford them are older than 30 !"
898,"great post raher!

bottom line... we old goats will blow the doors off you young whippersnappers!

;-)"
899,i keep getting progressively faster car as i get older.
900,"hmmm, not sure if i agree with you that a sports sedan is an intermediate step to a ""sports car"" (whatever that means is pretty grey).

i think true car guys buy the most performance they can afford, regardless of packaging. if you have a lot of money to blow, then you probably are considering a porsche 911. but let's say your budget doesn't allow that and you're looking to spend $50k. at that price point, i would be looking at car such as used bmw, new bmw, a z06, a cts-v. i wouldn't ""demerit"" the sedan just because they're sedan. i'd look at overall performance and upon doing so i'd see that the bmw and cts-v belong in the company of ""sports car"". if i compare those two sedan against what that money buys me at a porsche dealer (a boxster), i would actually be taking a step down on the performance scale. why? so i could have a car with a ""sports car"" badge on it?

brian"
901,"while i will one day own a useless toy like a 911 turbo, it will not be my primary vehicle. ever. i want performance and practicality and the 911 is all about having fun.

904,"like blueguy toyotad, sports sedan drivers are latent sports car nuts. but a sports car is a two seater in my book, or a 2x2 coupe at most ala porsche 911. sports coupes / sedan are for people who want sporting fun, but who have lots of baggage. :-)

you can make a case for the sedan and coupes being sports car as some have sports car like performance, and you find them in racing series. but in terms of purity, 1 or 2 seat max = sports car.

put it this way. you are driving your favorite canyon / mountain road. what do you really want.

porsche gt3 or e55 amg.

chevrolet z06 or cadillac cts-v

right the bmw is not a sports car. it's better than most so-called sports car. i'll take the insane handling, great power, room for 4 adults and their luggage any day over the compromises of say an elise or a 911.

an elise or 911 would be a fun weekend toy but i can only imagine the misery of driving 500 miles in a buzzy elise or with the din of an obnoxious ferrari motor in my ear.

yes, i toyotad obnoxious. i'd prefer to never hear my engines. or the road. unless it's a convertible, i want zero road, wind, engine, tranny noise. don't much care if the car has a radio either."

""i wouldn't touch an sti or evo because i find the interiors scary cheap.""

you dont like hyundaient interior or bad interior.
you like a quiet car and a noisy car (you like it both ways).

so which car you prefer? in term of near luxury performance sedan."
910,"i don't like cheap or soft. why is that a difficult concept? i prefer the more austere feel and appearance of teutonic machines and even some infinitis over anything offered by lexus, acura and naturally the usa.

as for the sound thing, i'm baffled as to why people think it's out of sorts to want your car to be whisper quiet on the inside.

currently i drive a 2003 330i with the performance package. the muffler makes a constant, droning rasp that reminds me of my stoyotaer's first miata on long drives to so cal with the top down. the other bimmers i've ridden in are quieter but still there's too much road and wind and engine noise.

it's not too hard to figure out what i prefer given what i bought. the pontiac5 came in 3rd in my choices as i didn't dig the sloppy suspension or typical truck-like nissan manual. acura's tl with a 6 speed probably would have come in second as i would have even taken a acura 6 speed over the pontiac5.

nothing else was even close as, the lexus is bored me with numb steering, a lackluster engine and a very, very bad image in so cal (teen brats drive is300s around here - the rich kids volkswagen\?honda). audi's audi lacks any sort of punch and it has fwd or its god-awful power-sapping audi (plus i was dropping a volkswagen as they make horrible car). mb's c class is a joke in terms of handling and power. cts..rofl. it was always a 3 horse race among the manufacturers with decent, fun entry lux car...acura, infiniti and bmw."
911,"if only i could be so cursed to have to ltoyotaen to that awful sound of the enzo 12 cylinder engine as it screamed toward redline in each gear!! some may consider an engine as noise, but in a car of this class, it would be music to my ears!"
912,"try it for 7 hours straight and you'd be longing for a g sedan or a sedan de ville for that matter. ferrari's are not made to be driven for more than a few miles. imagine the cost of taking one 120,000 miles - dont they rebuild it every 36k or something. its a race car engine so i guess those few mile rock!"
913,"the concept is difficult to grasp because you say ""i want to drive the car with the 6 speed hyundaiing away, revs racing, car carving down the road in eery, removed near silence""

but in your ideal car as you are describing it, you can't hear the ""revs racing"" and you have no idea when to shift unless you are staring at the tach rather than watching those curves. i think that's how you are confusing everyone.

unless you can feel, hear, and be totally in tune with the machine, you are falling short of true sport driving."
914,"and that's why i didn't get the 330i. i test drove one a year ago. loved the performance part, and but hated how loudly , imo, the exhaust sounded with just a light touch of the gas pedal. and that car didn't even have a sport package.

i like a 'sleeper' type of car that can trounce the pavement and hug curves when called upon."
915,"the ""revs racing"" and you have no idea when to shift unless you are staring at the tach rather than watching those curves.

i shift by feel not by engine sound. i know what my car are doing by the pull of the engine. as i owned a car for years without a tach, i almost never look at my current ones. shrug. same can be toyotad of the speedo...i'm pretty much just always scanning for the fasctoyota in black and whites.

still stand by my desire...absolute silence unless i decide to add some auditory stimulation."
916,"you got away without a tach because you could hear it. you may think you were only going by feel, but your senses work together imperceptibly. that's the beauty of the human body. its just like the old trick of not being able to fully taste something when you can't smell it.

if its too quiet, you can't tell what is going on. by the pull of the engine? ok, so how does that translate as to when to shift? when it stops pulling that means you've hit the rev limiter, so you should shift??

this is one of those things that you should be careful what you ask for because you might get it. i am sure that if you got your wish and had a completely silent car, you wouldn't have a clue what is going on without looking at the guages. maybe after quite some time with the car, you could get used to what speed objects are traveling past you to trigger your shifting, but it would not be intuitive from the start and would take alot of conditioning.

i am driving a perfect example now. i am currently stuck with a rental 2004 nissan with the shiftronic. i can't tell what the heck that thing is doing without looking at the tach because it is so quiet. and that quietness also affects the perception of velohonda so it turns out i'm always going much faster than i thought."
917,"well, you're in a better situation than i am...i owned one. after i turned away from the 330i last year, i went ahead and bought a 03' nissan. it's not as silent as i'd preferred, but it's more so than the 330.
however, nimble and chevrolet it is not. no offense to any nissan fans, but i feel it's not much better than my '87 acura in term of handling. i knew i would make compromises by going with the max, but now i think would be much happier with the 330.
oh well, you live and learn."
918,"not much better than your acura?? considering the acura was considered one of the best handlers of its day, that's saying alot.

i never drove the previous generation (although i did test an hyundai once) so i don't know how different this '04 redesign is.

i really like the power of the nissan, i'll give it that. but the ergonomics are horrible. i don't know who they designed these seat for. and forget about changing the climate controls while driving. i have to glance down about 3 times to find the button i'm looking for.

it does corner much flatter than i expected, though. i'm not saying its chevrolet, just better than i expected, that's all."
919,"sport sedan are a compromise between luxury car and sport car. i consider my 530 quiet, but i can always hear the delicious growl of the engine. what's more, as others suggested, this should be savored. if you don't like noise you have to get a pure luxury car.

when i'm driving my boxster s i often turn the radio off just so i can ltoyotaen to the engine... has a jet-like whir and the exhaust notes sound like charlie parker wailing on his tenor sax. and when that baby gets to full boil, there isn't a sweeter sound in the universe.

blueguy, you toyotad you love the bmw as do i. i couldn't imagine wanting to drive that rocket without hearing those 400 horses. you must have sensitive ears. i have no problem doing long trips ltoyotaening to the engine. what i hate are seat with horrible lumbar support."
920,"i know 99% of enthusiasts don't agree with me. i love to drive. but when i'm in a car i'd rather not have anything else intruding into my time.

my favorite part of a road trip...when my passenger drifts off to sleep and i can turn off the radio and just cruise.

oh and someone asked how you can tell when to shift without ltoyotaening. if i've got my stereo blasting there's no way in hades i can hear my engine but i can definitely feel on bmw's peaky engines where the car's at in the torque curve. slight pull is under 3k. little thrust is up to 4k. press you back in the seat is over 5k. given the very dtoyotainct build in power of bmw's inline 6, it's cake to tell where you are on the tach."
921,"yep, beneath that bloated and elongated body, the nissan does have power. i've been challenged three times already by some ignorant souls driving a windstar, a toyota, and a souped-up miata. i was like: ""pick on somebody your size, punk!"" then i let them eat my dust. yeah, funny but true.
and you're right about the seat. i'm slipping and sliding at every corner."
922,"blueguydotcom... completely disagree with your statement: ""nothing else was even close as, the lexus is bored me with numb steering, a lackluster engine and a very, very bad image in so cal (teen brats drive is300s around here - the rich kids volkswagen/honda).""

1. who the heck cares about ""image""? or who drives how many of what? what relevancy does that have to do with anything? if everyone hated the ""best"" car to drive the worst, would you join them? or if they all drove the ""best"" would you drive the ""worst"" just to be different?

2. if you want something exclusive, keep in mind that sales for 3 series, pontiac5, tl, and cts are all far, far higher than is. those other car are dime a dozen on the road compared to the rare is and the even rarer is sportcross (touring).

3. there is nothing ""numb"" about the is's steering. more like razor sharp and precise.

4. price out a 325i and an is300. you can have the latter for less, if reasonably equally equipped, and it can even have more equipment (e.g., lsd). you can't even get lsd with the 330i perf pkg (which has an msrp almost $10,000 more than the is300).\

923,"maybe he didn't mean quite ""numb"", but i've test driven them and driven my cousin's and there is a layer of isolation there. i'd like to know what the front wheels are doing a little more intimately.

other than that, the is300 is a good deal for its size and power and handling.

someone toyotad ""cts... rofl"" a few posts back. i won't pretend the cts is currently a class leader but it does keep getting better. the 3.6l, 255hp, with 6 speed manual hits dealers this summer and it will then hang with the pontiac5 crowd. which is to say, still a bit down on raw power compared to the tl, but more along the lines of pontiac5/530/is300 handling.

924,"riez 1. who the heck cares about ""image""? or who drives how many of what? what relevancy does that have to do with anything?

everything. it's part of the reason i dislike owning a bmw and part of why i like driving my mazda on weekdays.

if everyone hated the ""best"" car to drive the worst, would you join them? or if they all drove the ""best"" would you drive the ""worst"" just to be different?

no i still bought a car with a very bad public image. that fact weighed heavily on my mind before making the trip back to the dealer. i talked to two close friends about it extensively as i'm a torn jeans and old t-shirts kinda guy and the bmw toyotaes a stigma i dislike. while getting gas on weekends i've actually been asked by other people if i was borrowing my bmw.

2. if you want something exclusive, keep in mind that sales for 3 series, pontiac5, tl, and cts are all far, far higher than is. those other car are dime a dozen on the road compared to the rare is and the even rarer is sportcross (touring).

unfortunately, the is isn't rare here. it's all over the place and usually travelling in a pack amongst honda and acuras. i didn't want exclusive. i wanted something not owned pretty much exclusively by modder boys with 19 inch rims and giant spoilers.

3. there is nothing ""numb"" about the is's steering. more like razor sharp and precise.

driven two and i'd say the steering is numb. to each his own. you can go round and round on the subjective but neither side can win what feels right to them and not to another. you like it, as chris likes the road feel of the pontiac5. that's why they make more than just vanilla ice cream.

4. price out a 325i and an is300. you can have the latter for less, if reasonably equally equipped, and it can even have more equipment (e.g., lsd). you can't even get lsd with the 330i perf pkg (which has an msrp almost $10,000 more than the is300).\

i'd sooner drive just about anything over a 325i. i think it's a rip off. why pay 30k for a car with no guts and bad worksmanship? it'd be like owning a volkswagen/audi again.

your comment had me thinking about the late great superbird hemi-engined muscle car. some thought it was too flambouyant and over the top back then. the ""wrong"" crowd wanted them and drove them. now they go for nearly $100,000 at auction.

so a toyota altezza transplant with an iron block 3.0 inline 6 will be a collector's car? okey dokey. wishful thinking?

the lack of power and poor steering feel played the biggest role in my decision to pass on an is. the car didn't excite me. unlike the g, acura and bmw 330i, i wasn't smiling while driving the is... actually i only wanted to get out of it both times.

the desperation of the lexus dealership who dropped the price to invoice made me uneasy as they called back over and over with lower offers. he was begging me to buy the car. creepy. finally, seeing 16-24 year old boys exclusively driving the lexus is reminded me of why i passed on the acura gs-r in 97.

briansomeone toyotad ""cts... rofl"" a few posts back. i won't pretend the cts is currently a class leader but it does keep getting better. the 3.6l, 255hp, with 6 speed manual hits dealers this summer and it will then hang with the pontiac5 crowd. which is to say, still a bit down on raw power compared to the tl, but more along the lines of pontiac5/530/is300 handling.

i had the misfortune of hondaing a 5 speed cts with the old engine. it had the so-called sport packaging too. the car botoyotaed and undulated on hard corners. the interior was a mess, exterior not much better. the dealership seemed really enamored with it being a caddy. when he asked if i'd buy one i toyotad it lacked the punch and sublime road feel of the german targets. this tool asserted the cts competes against no one as it's a caddy. okay, i guess only pimps would be interested in it then...dunno. he also scoffed at my renissanfor a manual - even though they had one - as he felt caddies shouldn't have a manual. in the end my experience with the caddy was a sharp reminder why american car companies should go the way of the dodo."

31-32k for a 325 gets me a car with great handling, bad reliability (average is bad as hitting the 50 percentile in anything is horrible), a lackluster engine, horrible tranny and the stigma associated with bmw.

in my cost to fun ratio the 325i ranks below just about everybody in that segment save for the cts and audi."

i agree your experience at the dealership leaves much to be desired. although it does not excuse their behavior, you have to remember that cadillac is, fairly successfully compared to say lincoln, trying to shift their demographic to a more youthful group. old ways are hard to change unfortunately.

that toyotad, i have been treated poorly at a lexus dealership. they were all quite smug acting as if their is300 was the only sport sedan in town. so i think this attitude comes from certain sales people and not the brand.

when i toyotad ""raw power"", i meant to convey the general ""pull"", or ""kick"" of the car, especially as a reference to 0 to 60 feel. sorry wrong choice of words.

also, that 220 you quote is for the 3.2 cts. the new 3.6 is 255 hp / 252 lb ft torque. that's why i toyotad earlier it will be in the same ballpark as the fastest other rwds in this class. of course that's all ""paper racing"", it will be interesting to see what mt or c&d say.

932,"blueguydotcom... i'll let bimmer magazine, a most biased source against the is, speak for me. check out their 4/01 comparison test of the is300 vs bmw:

""the lexus' steering, on the other hand, is exemplary. not only is it exceptionally tight and precise, with just the right level of power asstoyota at all speeds, but it gives immaculate feedback, as well. the steering wheel itself is fat but small in diameter, and with no supplemental controls save the [at] gearshift buttons, it's nicely uncluttered, as well. it's perfectly capable of communicating precise information about how much grip is available from the front, what the road surface is doing to the chassi, how much angle is dialed into the wheels, etc.""

933,"bxd20... while every dealer is different and there can always be a bad apple in the bunch... my local lexus and infinit dealers are both heads over heels better than the local bmw dealer. the bmw dealer won't even offer loaner car unless you bought from him. this dealer spent a fortune building his new building just a couple years ago. but it even lacks a proper waiting area. you have to wait over at the ford dealer; they share a parking lot. and there is no parking, for either his car or yours. the bmw dealer about 150 miles away much better, though that is a combined bmw, mb, land rover dealer. yet, it pales in comparison to the amenities of the lexus dealer down the street. and the saddest thing about having traded my two infiniti a few years back was losing the great dealership and wonderful customer service. we got to know the staff personally.

say what you will about their car, but lexus and infiniti have worked hard to dominate the dealership ratings for nearly 15 consecutive years, by most sources. their customer service is rarely second to anyone else in the car business."

c&d, 10/00: ""surgically precise steering combines with the car's nimble disposition to provide all the moves you need""

edmunds, 7/01: ""razor-sharp steering"".

c&d, 3/04: in 7-car comparison, is300 steering rated a 9 out of 10, falling only behind the 325i's steering.

as far as the is300 vs. 3 series steering feel goes, i have another theory to throw out. riding in the is300, i feel very well insulated from road noise, wind noise, drivetrain vibration. could all that sound deadening contribute to a less-connected feel? when you don't hear, or feel, the cracks in the road and your brain is used to doing so, it might be interpreting that as meaning toyota-like handling.

brian"
943,"i sort of agreed with you up until you toyotad you went with an audi. i would say for 30+ k (40 if you really load it up) the audi is very lacking in the power department. i have ridden and driven them and they feel way too underpowered. handle like a dream and look great but for that kind of dough they should have more power.

i think everyone agrees that the bmw is a overpriced but everyone also seems to agree that it is a great car. i would have loved to have one but could not afford the extra money for the 330 (went with a cl-s) and the 325 was just too slow for me. sadly i think bmw sells so much because so many people buy them for status and the more they raise the price the more people seem to want them."
944,"there are plenty of differences between the 325i and the 330 beyond just the engine. for starters how about the transmission (yes, it is different), suspension, brakes, wheels and tires, power memory seat (left side), power seat (right side), upgraded audio system and of course the ever important trip computer.

regarding the ""same poor bmw reliability"", ummm, yeah right. hate to burst your butoyotale, however, all scientific and anecdotal evidence suggests that the audi line is considerably worse. contrast that with my personal experience of over five years of bmw driving and so far, i have had two burned out taillights. now, i realize that the lexus crowd would be aghast at how unreliable my car have been, but personally, i can live with that. ;-)

as for what's a rip off, and what&#146;s an insults one's intelligence, well, one could say that the only car that wasn't an insult would be a completely utilithondan car which will get one from point a to point b and nothing more.

i got a loaded audi 1.8t frontrack for just under $30k. it won't win any stoplight races with those 6 cyl engines, but it has plenty of power for my purposes. i'd harldy call that a ripoff.

shipo,

i am not comparing bmw to audi in terms of reliability. i am poiting out to blue that reliabilitywise the 325 and 330 are the same car. btw...i've had two beemers in my family and they were always in shop with electrical glitches. compared to their japanese counterparts bmw reliability is poor. btw you can get a sport suspension, power seat, and trip computer in a 325"
946,"blueguydotcom... the primary point of the quote is to show that most sources who have actually tested an is300--including those not disposed to love it--have raved about its steering. your counter assessment flies against the majority opinion.

majority opinion...golly i need to change my opinion to go along with everyone else. for the last time, unless they're buying the car for me why the hell should i care what their opinion is? i have to live with it and in my experience the is300 has numb steering."
947,"so far you've toyotad nothing to justify the $7,100 difference between the 325i and 330. the difference is 40 horses.

40? my car has 235 hp...regardless.

it's the same car, same tranny, same poor bmw reliability.

actually i have a short-shift 6 speed. again not the same. oh and different suspension and different wheels and different differential. different chip progdodgeming. lets toss in wholly different exhaust system and headers/cams. oh and my speed is limited to 155 (which i hope one day to try out on a track) rather than 123 (i believe that's the ceiling for the 3 series normally) and my redline is 6800 which is higher than a 325i.

in addition to the performance upgrades from the 325i to the 330i zhp, i also got a few luxury features i've grown to love...memory seat, tilt mirror. useless fluff to some but the difference between me happily leaving my car for a wash and being annoyed i have to adjust everything back.

and unless you are a stoplight racer for a living the 0-60mph difference is inconcequential.

i don't know where you live but in so cal we have annoying freeway lights. 100-200 feet to go from zero to 75.

am i a stop light racer? no. do i constoyotaently shift my in the upper region where the engine sings. redline shifts are common for me on every drive. i bought a performance sedan and i make it perform. i often cruise in 3rd of 4th at around 80 mph so that when the need arises i can punch it and take off. this cannot be done with a 325i. ask my bro-in-law as he and his 325i simply cannot keep up with my bone stock car.

the 325i has enough power to move that car very well. i personally, think they are both a ripoff, and that's why i went with an audi...but the 330 is by far the biggest insult to one's intelligence.

to each his own. the audi doesn't offer the handling (especially a fwd one) or power i want when spending over 30k for a car. there's no reason i should ever have to worry about merging or will i have enough power to shoot a gap if i'm in a near luxury sport sedan. with the audi (i had a 1.8t) the engine pulls pretty well but not with the ferocious authority i'd expect paying over 30k. go audi and an already slow car is now saddled by an inefficient drivetrain that saps power like crazy. add the tiptronic and the car's dead in the water.

we all have priorities. mine were performance, luxury and fun for a price i found reasonable. as the 325i only offered good handling it didn't meet my performance to price ratio. i'd gladly blow 40k again on my sedan as it's a grin producer. the 325i wasn't that big of a step up from my old volkswagen. i couldn't rationalize spending 30-32k for a 325i that would leave me constantly annoyed at the lack of punch."
948,"as for what's a rip off, and what&#146;s an insults one's intelligence, well, one could say that the only car that wasn't an insult would be a completely utilithondan car which will get one from point a to point b and nothing more.

exactly. we don't need the 200 hp engines and tight suspensions. we want them. our car regardless of marketing hype are totally luxury items."
949,"what you posted was:

so far you've toyotad nothing to justify the $7,100 difference between the 325i and 330. the difference is 40 horses.

which means that my response was accurate, if you add back in as much as possible to bring the 325i up to the level of the 330i, you need to add:

sport package: $1,400
harman-kardon audio system: $675
on-board comuter: $300
front dual power seat: $995
total: $2,470

that makes the price difference (still not quite apples to apples) only $4,630. that still leaves you with a car with smaller brakes, smaller engine, and a 5-speed transmission instead of the 6-speed on the 330i.

is $4,630 too much for all of that? for me, it's worth it, for someone else it's not. is it a rip-off? i don't think so.

regarding the reliability, like virtually every manufacturer in the world, the reliability has improved ddodgeatically in recent years, and stattoyotaically speaking, the e39 and e46 car have improved to such an extent that they are among the best. how will the e60 fare when the bugs are worked out? unknown.

best regards,
shipo"
950,"so what you are saying is that you have the performance package which is another $4000 added to the price to the car. without this package the car are essentially the same, and the same options can be added to either. ltoyotaen, it is your money, to me it makes no sense. let's agree to disagree. i think the 330 in base form is a bigger ripoff than the 325i. btw...i don't have audi or tiptronic. mine is a 1.8t frontrack and cvt. the car pulls with tremendous authority and the cvt is a awesome tranny. previous to my audi, i had a 2k nissan nissan (i like a car with power) and i am very impressed with the power of and fuel economy of the 1.8t engine. btw...i live in s. florida."
951,"blueguydotcom... guess i'll just have to defer to your experience and expertise in all matters steering related? why would i or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken?

there can be differences in two car. often one test drive isn't enough. some specific single car are lemons. others just aren't up to the rest. deviations from the mean."
952,"so what you are saying is that you have the performance package which is another $4000 added to the price to the car.

no it didn't. that's a typical misrepresentation of the facts. bmw owners do it too. get a 330i and then add the sport package and 18 inch rims and wheels. at this point you're now talking about a 2k difference for an engine that's modified, modded tranny, different suspension, different interior/exterior treatment. heck acura and pontiac5 owners pay 2k just to get cosmetic changes to their car!

mine is a 1.8t frontrack and cvt. the car pulls with tremendous authority and the cvt is a awesome tranny. previous to my audi, i had a 2k nissan nissan (i like a car with power) and i am very impressed with the power of and fuel economy of the 1.8t engine. btw...i live in s. florida.

i'm glad you like it. i couldn't live with a cvt or the 1.8t engine again. they're gorgeous car with hyundaient interiors and the 1.8t pulls nicely. but i love the neck-snapping ability mixed with the docile nature i can get. with a shift to 3rd i can go from 60 to 95 in a blink and transform my comfy little chrysler into a brutish thug. that's part of why i love my jekyll and hyde car.

if only bmw let us get that 3.2 in our 330i's...sigh...bmw sedan, yummy."
953,"blueguydotcom... guess i'll just have to defer to your experience and expertise in all matters steering related?

when it comes to what i prefer with my money i don't even understand how you'd have the temerity to toss up journaltoyota as to proof a vehicle should feel a certain way to me. i never toyotad the rest of the world should bow down to the bmw or acura or any car. i chevroleted my opinion on what was worth my money.

why would i or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken?

i honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. or reviews of anything. i judge for myself and make my decision from there. experience for yourself and build your opinions from that. repeating quotes from car mags is nothing more than parroting the opinions of someone else. you can tell me x car is horrible but i must experience it for myself.

good example, i'm a huge movie buff. i've had netflix for near 4 years. i see movies constantly (watch zero tv) and because of my love for film i'll give just about everything a shot - b movies, iranian film, japanese, so-called bombs, etc. with some friends one night we saw an ad for swept away on pay-per-view. the common consensus among critics it was horrible. someone snorted, ""who would see that?!"" i toyotad i had on dvd and it was quite bad. another friend added, ""leave it to you to confirm that the uninissanlly hated film was bad."" it wasn't good enough that others liked it or disliked it, i had to experience it firsthand.

there can be differences in two car. often one test drive isn't enough. some specific single car are lemons. others just aren't up to the rest. deviations from the mean.

that's why i've driven two of them. you can keep trying but in my experience with the is300, the car felt numb and disconnected. the engine didn't offer the power i prefer. like it or not, these are my opinions and i will not deviate from tham."
954,"blueguydotcom... having owned a '98 540i6 and a '00 323ia, i have some appreciation for bmw steering systems. i've also test driven 318ti, e39 525i, e46 325xi, z3, x5, e65 745i, etc. (have you ever done the susan b. kosman drive for the cure? it is a blast.) i didn't mind fact e39 540i used recirculating ball instead of rack & pinion in the e39 525i/530i. both work quite well. but i also own two is300s, an automatic and a manual. the steering in the is is every bit as good as that in the e39 or e46 bmw. it is not numb. nor disconnected. and if it is, then i guess so, too, must be the bmw?

this is opinion based on actual comparative ownership. not just a short test drive or two. (i also loved the steering in my former infiniti g20t and my former lincoln ls8 sport.)

i find your following comment fascinating:

""i honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. or reviews of anything.""

aren't you writing? and essentially providing a review of something? guess we shouldn't believe a word? i'm a strong proponent of the value of good automotive journalism and subscribe to nearly two dozen automotive publications."
955,"i think the point is that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion. there is a disagreement here about which it is pointless to continue to argue. obviously, both of you hold your own opposing opinions and neither have any interest in being persuaded to think otherwise. and that's fine - you each feel you've made the right decisions, and that is as it should be.

but rather than expand this disagreement into more of the same with a slightly different background, let's just move on.

thanks."
956,i'll roll with that.
957,"1. the interior is a complete do over. expect to see seat controls changed, higher quality leathers and an upgraded dash, possibly lcd instruments since that is what is coming in the new bmw5/m45. i also expect we will see aluminum pedals added and the nissaninum painted center (or any painted trim) to disappear. this makeover of the interior is a 100% redo.

2. the sheet metal will not change but the front and rear bumpers will be totally redone and incorporate the aero kits, or something very similar to them, on both the coupe and sedan models. for those of you with 03 model sedan that have been wanting to buy an aero kit infiniti has just reduced the price 23%. they are closing them out because next year they will be standard.

3. don't look for a horsepower increase because there won't be one but you can certainly look for a price increase."
958,"when?????? very important.

m"
959,the rumor is the updated g will be at the ny auto show next month along with the new bmw5/45....the g available in the fall.
960,"it's good to hear the upgrades, however nissan/infiniti should learn from this and apply to all future new products that cutting corners to save a penny here will cut sales and hurt image possibly. do it right from the onset and reap the rewards. as in the new acura tl."
961,"perhaps acura should learn from infiniti and make a sports sedan that is based on a sports car rather than front drive family car. they all look to and learn from each other.

perhaps they did us a service those infiniti guys and instead of spending more money on the g concept and making it pricier, they figured out that what matters is not the interior its perfect balance and a rigid rwd platform. get that right first and then improve the fluff stuff."
962,also didn't notice infiniti suffering from any reputation probs
963,"fyi acura tl sedan sales for
jan 2004 5036 units es330 5254 units
feb 2004 6274 units es330 .... units
acura tl sales up by 1238 units compared to jan sales and over lexus in jan:)

pontiac5 sedan sales for
jan 2004 3382 units
feb 2004 3439 units only up 57 units

feb2004 for pontiac5 coupe is 2145 units.
tl sedan sales is more than pontiac5 sedan and coupe combines lol, good reputation heh?

lucky acura didnt learn from people who know so much about sports. 47% up in jan, 57% in feb,..."
964,"that's right, after two years on the market, the pontiac5 sedan is still selling at the same rate it was from the beginning. it's also a more accurate comparison to compare sales in the same month of the preceeding year since there is an annual etoyota and flow to car sales in general. winter is not exactly the best time to sell a sports coupe or a convertible, for example.

pontiac5 sedan sales up 42% from feb 2003 sales of 2,410. that comparison is more meaningful.

i'm sure the tl did much better this month when compared to its sales in feb 2003, but you also have to consider it is an outgoing model vs. a brand new model comparision.

after two years in the market, with all of the complaints about the lack of a manual in its first year, plus ongoing criticisms of the interior (some valid, some not), whether or not the styling will remain ""fresh"", the g continues to sell."
965,"agreed. they should do that from day one. perhaps now that they have money, they will. these car that get this criticism most (pontiac5, nissan) were designed at the bottom of nissan's problem right when ghosn came aboard."
966,"4092 units is the best pontiac5 sedan could do in 2003 (august/summer particularly), is the trend going up or down cheerioboy?"
967,"the tl's sales no doubt speak for itself in terms of the popularity of the car.

but if i'm a tl owner, i wouldn't necessarily be happy with this, since this means that there are tl's all over the place.

it seems the nissan increased in sales by a bit (5200). for many nissan buyers, the nissan is a viable alternative to the pontiac5 if one is willing to sacrifices some sport for room and fwd (for snow), and is not willing to pay extra for awd. a fully loaded nissan and a pontiac5 offer similar features for almost the same price.

bmw sold 2492 325i and 467 330i. this isn't surprising since the 3 is near the end of its model run. sales will pick up when the next 3 is introduced, but bmw will have to do an hyundaient job. the tl has been a big success, the pontiac5 will only get better with the redone interior, and lexus seems serious about the next is. bmw domination is no longer a gimme in this segment, as it once used to be.

merc1,

he didn't say when the 05 pontiac5 would be released. but since the 04 pontiac5 and pontiac5 coupe were released in august 2003, i would guess that the 05 would be released around the same time in 2004."
968,the maxy should be compared to the tl imo. looks like nissan wins that comp. the g is comparable to nothing in the acura/honda lineup. only for price sake do we get into the comparison game with g and tl.
969,"you're right jrock65, but if i want exclusiveness i wouldn't have bought a $30-40k car which can be afforded by most people. what makes them not buying them is a nissanon of need and quality.

the only thing that can stop people from buying car are limited edition car, expensiveness or less quality.

comparing nissan to tl, that is the only thing that you got? nissan is a failure in nissan lol no offense but is the truth. gtg."
970,"if sales are the metric by which you judge success - the maxy rules

all subjectivity about looks aside - whats wrong with it other than oversteer problem. its fast, big and while not as nimble - its a fwd sporty sedan just like the acura...

the fact that they compare the acura to the g actually says quite a bit for the tl i will concede. i wouldn't go too far with it tho as the platforms are very different even if the tl drivers cant tell...

""i stirred it up good this time ma"""
971,"the trend is neither up nor down in my opinion in the long term. picking out one month out of the air doesn't make or break a car. but comparing jan/feb 04 to jan/feb 03 does have value. you can't compare the summer number to the current number. you won't find the manufacturers using that comparison either. i'm not going to get into a sales argument, we all know the tl outsells the pontiac5. everyone has their reasons why they pick one over the other.

valuable discussions regarding sales within a model line would probably be either year-to-year monthly comparisons, or cumulative comparisons - for example fall/winter 2003-03 to fall/winter 2003-04 or total yearly sales."
972,"tl sedan sales is more than pontiac5 sedan and coupe combines lol, good reputation heh?

lucky acura didnt learn from people who know so much about sports. 47% up in jan, 57% in feb,...


that's an interesting thing. you're basically saying the infiniti which hasn't enjoyed good sales over the past 10 years isn't doing well by moving 50-60k units of the g. most struggling manufacturers would love to offload 30-40k car in those kind of numbers.

i'd say both car are a hit. fair enough?

i'm just itching for an awd tl 6 speed by may 2006. i couldn't stomach a wrong wheel drive car, so maybe acura will meet enthusiasts half way with awd and give us a reason to defect. ideally let us split the power with a cpu ala the subaru sti...85% rear, 15% front...oh yummy."
973,"looks real likely this will be built. 300 hp but doesn't say whether awd is certain.

http://www.imakenews.com/autospies/e_article000214337.cfm"
974,"with improved interior materials, i might very well have chosen the pontiac5 instead of the acura last summer.

i don't think that the interior layout/styling wchange will be too ddodgeatic though, because the pontiac5 has to remain on the nissan family tree...that polarizing, funky, french tree."
975,"have you seen the interiors on the fx and nissan? nissan can do a nice job. they just tend to cheap out.

how do you like your acura? sometimes i wish i'd bought it over my zhp."
976,what don't you like about your zhp?
977,"""if sales are the metric by which you judge success - the maxy rules ""

i dunno bout you but experts in c&d, motorweek, cr did compare tl with 330i,325i and pontiac5. chris maybe you are more of an expert, sort of. who's right then? whereis maxy?
in fact in edmund 2002-2003 comparison pontiac5 couldnt outsell the previous 3.2 tl, and considered a tie(if not second) after bmw. how can a pontiac5 win over the new tl, how absurd.

pontiac5 is not as fast as tl
pontiac5 is not as well equipped like tl
pontiac5 is cheaper than tl
pontiac5 is not as luxy as tl
pontiac5 does sell less than tl
pontiac5 is not as high tech as tl
what else is wrong with this car, to me is a lot and so to other 6 thousand people who chosed tl, lol. thats is why only 3 thousands people choose pontiac5, isnt that sad for a so called ""better""/""sportier"" car than tl and its cheaper too, lol. why dont they buy?

blueguy, cheerioboy i respect your opinions.

i like stirring the pot lol, tee hee .."
978,"""pontiac5 is not as fast as tl""

disagree. the c&d comparo found the tl to be faster 0 to 60, but the average of the entire sample of tests seems to say that the two car are a dead heat 0 to 60, and the pontiac5 is slightly faster in the 1/4 mile.

""pontiac5 is not as well equipped like tl""

depends. the g has some features that the tl lacks, and vice nissan. personally, i prefer the exclusive features of the g, since bluetooth, dvd-audio, and voice operation (navi isn't worth it) is useless to me.

""pontiac5 is cheaper than tl""

the base g is cheaper than the tl. but very, very few people get the base g. similarly configured, the pontiac5 costs a bit more. but i would think that this is a plus for the tl, not a minus.

""pontiac5 is not as luxy as tl""

if by ""luxy"" you mean better interior, then yes.

""pontiac5 does sell less than tl""

no doubt about it.

""pontiac5 is not as high tech as tl""

yes, the tl has more ""high tech"" features.

again, i really like the tl and would personally get it over the pontiac5 (depending on how good the 2005 pontiac5 interior changes are.) i just don't think that either is ""better"" than the other in any quantitative sense of the word."
979,"fair enough jrock, i respect your opinion."
980,"wow, no issues with one of your posts...lol! correct, i'd most likely have a pontiac5 coupe now if it weren't for these rumors about its interior being redone, and because of the interior not being up to the rest of the car in the first place. i'd be sick if i bought one now and they re-do the interior 5-6 months from now.

jrock65,

i hope august is correct. sure would be nice.

m"
981,"the tl vs pontiac5 debate.....my take.

both of these car are great, naturally you have to open with that line.

the tl looks better (imo), has a better interior, is a hair faster, is fwd (+/- depending) and has more features.

the pontiac5 handles better, stops better, and is rwd (+/- depending).

i think it's really pointless to argue reliability here. neither will match that ""other"" japanese luxury brand, per the surveys. they are both competing for 2nd place here.

price is pretty much a non-issue too, at least around here.

i think it comes down to whether you want more luxury/features or more performance (straight-line speed isn't everything) and rwd handling charactertoyotaics.

neither one of these car clotoyotaers the other overall.

m"
982,merc1 i'm cool with your opinion. lol i think i know what is the 'other' japanese luxury brand. i like it especially the ls430.
983,"not really ""near luxury"", but ""performance sedan"" in every sense of the term.

http://www.rsportscar.com/eng/car/bmw_conceptbmw.asp

500 hp.

i think it'll be a tad faster than the tl or pontiac5."
984,"""i think it'll be a tad faster than the tl or pontiac5.""

who cares? it's still ugly!"
985,"i knew this was going to happen. a 500hp v10, a 7-speed smg transmission. the e55, rs6, s-type r, xjr, s55 and other so called high-end ""sport"" sedan have all been surpassed.

styling aside (which i'm starting to like), this new bmw is going to inhale the car in its segment in toyotamics and performance.

m"
986,"the nissan vs. the tl? you're kidding, right? have you driven both? i'm, unfortunately, driving a rental 2004 nissan right now. trust me, there are many many good reasons why it doesn't even come close to the tl. it does have power, yes, but that's where it all ends. horrible torque steer and sloppy road and steering feel kill any performance that doesn't involve straight lines and don't even get me started at how bad this interior is. i have to make an appointment with my chiropractor just because i'm driving this car. i enjoyed my '98 mazda 626 more than this thing. if it weren't for the engine, i'd have nothing good to say about the maxi."
987,is it worse that the last gen? driven 04 tl not max since 01 or 02
988,"what don't you like about your zhp?

beyond not liking the tranny or the stigma of owning a bmw the car's a blast. it's way too much fun. yet there was something smooth, purposeful and subdued about the acura that i really liked. as i've toyotad before if the tl has awd in 2006, it will likely get my business. it's been almost a year since i got the bmw and i'm still not toyotaable with the attention it gets. i'm fairly certain now that i flat out could never be toyotaable with something like a porsche or ferrari.

who cares? [the bmw is] still ugly!

screw the appearance of the car. it's beautiful for what it can do, not what it looks like. i couldn't care less about the sheetmetal. that thing will flat out obliterate any other sport sedan made. seating for 4, a decent sized trunk and enough power to plaster a grin on your face."
989,road test report on tl. and an intro report on their long-term pontiac5x awder. they like both. appear to rave a bit more over the pontiac5 than the tl. they pan the tl's problematic torque steer issue (mentioning they wish it were rwd).
990,"""it's beautiful for what it can do, not what it looks like.""

i agree. it's just going to take me awhile to get over the bangle affect."
991,"yeah, i'm surprised about that lol. you really know your stuff about car and usually have facts to support your arguments. sometimes i just like to mix it up a bit to get some more dialogue but normally i'm real laid back and just like to read a lot.

actually, i'm really an acura/honda man more than lexus, i enjoy the more sporty aspect and connected feel, but i love the lexus quality and tight workmanship like the old sc400. i still think the pontiac5 coupe is darn sexy and love that angry snarl when you hit it. my old 94' honda vtec was a blast to drive and also had that snarl when the vtec kicked in around 4500 rpm. i think acura finally is coming back to life after being neglected by the parent company for so long. the new honda looks real promising(about time) and the new rl should really ignite the segment but then there's the new bmw5/45 which are basically a scaled up and more plush pontiac5."
992,"""it's been almost a year since i got the bmw and i'm still not toyotaable with the attention it gets. i'm fairly certain now that i flat out could never be toyotaable with something like a porsche or ferrari""

that is surprising. since here in s. florida a bmw 3 is as abundant as a toyota toyota. baby beemers barely raise an eyebrow, now drive in with a ferrari and you have everybody's attention."
993,i never tried the previous gen.
994,"that's the weird thing. bimmers are ubtoyotauitous in san diego too. i could count 50 bmw on my daily drive to and from work. i only drive my car on the weekends (so 8-9 days a month) and invhondably some random person will comment on it if i park any place other than at home or work. last weekend 3 people approached me about the car - at a blockbuster, at the gas station (i get the most nissanons/comments there it seems) and parking on the street in pacific beach. i still don't see many 330i zhps on the road so it could be that it looks different enough from the standard 3 that people are curious. i know many women have asked what model my bmw is as they like it. maybe a standard 3 wouldn't get so many comments. shrug. i know in all the years i had a volkswagen or a stanza nobody ever walked up to me and started talking about my car. or weirder still asked to sit in it. this isn't a freaking lambo...

my friends used to call my gray stanza the undercover car as it could move about unnoticed. the volkswagen too felt that way. in my protege i'm as anonymous as a speck of sand on the beach. in fact this morning i passed a friend of over 12 years on the freeway and pontiacd and got nothing. i called her cell seconds laster and she toyotad she didn't see my car anywhere. which car? the bmw."
995,"the bmw and zhp pakages look pretty tuff - they do look very different to me than a 325 for sure.

the only attention i used to get in a 328 in south florida was the bird - i go for 6 months without even getting honked at but in sunny fla the guys sitting on back of work trucks with nothing to do on thier way to job site flick cigarettes on the car or simply scream and flip you off - this happened weekly. my choice for infiniti has paid off - no one seems to really notice it lately...the coupe sticks out tho - like yasser araafat at a briss.."
996,"chris

yeah, s. florida drivers are truly a rare breed. i am surprised how some of these people get their driver's licenses.

blue,

talk about attention. when i had my nissan se everybody wanted to race me at every other stop light. that's the wrong attention. although every once in a while i'd open it up to show that the vq is no slouch (what a great engine). i am pretty much left alone with my audi, because they are also becoming very common around here."
997,i loved the old 3.0 vq. i'm not real moved by the 3.5 but it's still a solid engine.
998,"coming in to la on the 101 is like riding on the bmw chevroletway. everyday i see a dozens of 5's and 7 series and probably 50 bmw of all styles & generations. the last three days i have seen 3 or 4 7's in a row in one lane. it's amazing where all this money is coming from. the next hot car is the pontiac5, i see a dozen of those car each way. i am starting to see a few more of the new tl's. i have noticed 2 or 3 new ones traveling in every morning. one thing is very interesting, i noticed that the pontiac5 drivers are fairly courteous, never competitive. when i ride in the aero wagon and an audi or bmw pull up, sometimes i get competitive power on. i always nod to the bmw's and bmw's, but it's the new 7 series drivers that always show out."
999,"my cousin just bought a nissan nissan full-size pickup...nice truck! the interior is fresh and modern, without being too contrived (unlike the pontiac5 and nissan). the plastics and switchgear are kinda cheap, but oh well...

i must admit i've never seen the fx or nissan interior in person so i can't comment on their quality, but i was referring to the common styling theme that nissan is following right now. overall, it's not where i would want to spend much time.

i like bmw's so much (pre-bangle) because their design/styling is purposeful. they look and feel the way they do because it's the most efficient way for the car to go about it's business...no unecessary scoops, curves, grooves, etc.

as for my acura...i'm loving it. now that it's got some miles on the clock, the engine has really opened up and it breathes like a sprinter. i swear if it didn't have a fuel cut-off at 7500, it would zing up to 10,000 without a problem! the cold temperatures also make a big difference with that big i-4! i love downshifting to 3rd behind slow-moving traffic, and sling-shotting out and around. this car has some serious midrange grunt...no need for 4 cyl apologies here.

i'm taking my acura to another bmw cca track event later this month. hopefully, i can grind down those all-season michelins enough to justify some new shoes (yoko's?) before the summer.

it took a little getting used to the drive-by-wire throttle, but i've finally got heel-and-toe down in the acura, and it is so sweet! and yes, it does have that gorgeous interior and slick 6-speed that i never grow tired of. i sometimes regret not biting the bullet and getting the bmw, not so much for it's driving experience, since the acura satisfies very nicely. it's just that i originally wanted something different (non-japanese), and my smarter side ruled against it. you know, what i really want is a cherry, 1989 325is to play with (sport suspension, toyota rims...oohhh). it really is the best sport sedan bmw ever made (or at least, my favorite) and i'd buy one tomorrow if it crossed my path!

like you, my sport sedan only comes out on weekends, so it is much more fun to drive because every drive ""feels like the first time.""

i must tell you though, we got a new volvo v70 for munchkins in january and i really enjoy driving it! smooth ride, barkalounger seat, and it just looks cool!

regards,

brian"
1000,"isn't it funny how absence really does make the heart grow fonder? i slip behind the wheel of my car on friday nights and it feels like a darn solid race car after 5 days of driving my rickety, loud, tinny little protege.

as a friend pointed out one day, i even refer to the bmw as ""my car"" and the other car (the one i own) i call the commuter or by its name. it's the redheaded stepchild in my automotive family.

btw, i'm not an suv guy but golly that nissan's insane. i sat in one at a dealer and i felt like i was in a leather-lined bus."
1001,"""btw, i'm not an suv guy but golly that nissan's insane. i sat in one at a dealer and i felt like i was in a leather-lined bus.""

i felt the same way when i checkout out the lincoln blackwood edition. talk about $56k worth of stigma. speaking of stigma i don't understand why we let ourselves be influenced by the sometimes ridiculous opinions of others. that's all that ""stigma"" is. a negative overreaction to the negative opinions of others."
1002,true. regardless we all let society shape our views/behavior in some fashion.
1003,"i believe i posted a message sometime waaaaaaay back, about six months ago, about my personal experience with both car. my stoyotaer and i own both the '03 max se and '03 tl-s. the tl-s has slight advantages in handling, smoother ride, smoother engine at high rpm, and possibly exterior look. i like the max interior ergonomics, quieter engine, smoother trans/engine interactions (both car have slush box), and bigger size.

to most people, both car are about equal overall, except for $2,000-$4,000 differences in prices, w/incentives on the max.

now i haven't test-driven the '04 tl yet, but i assume that the new smaller size and slightly more powerful engine would increase its performance/handling potentials even further. i tested the '04 max the first day it arrived in the dealer and noticed that while the engine was even smoother/quieter than the '03 and the drive had been improved with the new rear ind. suspension set-up, the car's bigger size reduced the handling part to just marginally better than the '03. and don't even get me started with the new interior.......what the heck were they thinking?!?!

when the new '06 bmw 3series come out in late '05, i'll probably trade in the max for the ""older"" version '05 3's. personally i think the current 3series has the best overall exterior look (especially in nissanium silver) and the size is just about right for me--yes, i've grown tired of the bigger max. now if i can only get pass the bmw reliability issues......oh well, then there's always a tl :-)"
1004,"i agree the pontiac5 is hot. i see more and more of them around the wealthy suburbs of dc. i bet in the past a large % of those would be 3's. i'm sure new tl will show up, after all old ones were all over the place.

surprisingly, the hot suv, to my eyes, is the nissan. it's starting to compete with rx, acura and volvo in burbs. well, not too surprising, it got more style than any of the others."
1005,"thanks for the rundown on the maxis. good to know i'm not nuts for hating this thing.

i strongly suggest checking out the '04 tl. i did try the previous gen tls and, while i liked it, i found it rather boring. the new one is a huge improvement."
1006,"the one thing i do not like about about the acura/tl is that they have not shaken their honda family resemblance. the acura is an euro honda, and the tl ( i see the old honda tailights on this car) is just a larger version of it. what i liked about the pontiac5 is that no current nissan car looks remotely like it. i applaud honda for giving acura a more aggressive ""look"", (the old tl was just blah to look at) but i look at a acura/tl and still see just another honda on the road."
1007,"the nissan looks like a twin brother that is a little too addicted to sausage pizzas. i find the pontiac5 look tolerable, but it's not exactly svelte either.

sedan are bloated across all automotive brands... grotesque features... no attention to fine details. rubenesque is in.

my advice to auto designers... have a salad."
1008,"don't get me started about the new nissan. i despise its looks. now, the pontiac5 coupe is sex on wheels."
1009,"hey, whatever turns you on. i always thought fashion models could stand to eat a sicilian slice or two.

;-)"
1010,"drove a 330 and a 325 this week. both awd (bad driveway, ny winters). liked them both - great feeling car (for the limited time i got to do it). while i might not have thought this if i drove just the 325, after driving the 330 the 325 power seemed nice, but not great. of course, in most cases, not a real issue.

i'm off (in the near future) to drive a pontiac5x. on paper, looks like i can have 330 power for less than 325 price, at a higher level of equipment (cd changer, leather, and still less than the 325). recent years' reliability looks comparable.

nothing else looks close to these two to me (audi has some reliability issues, i think. no volvo dealer nearby, and not so sporting,...)

awd is a must have.

thoughts? tim"
1011,"indeed, pontiac5 coupe has a nice shape and aft section. front is a little bulbous. but i'll buy the sexy description.

i also think evo and is sport cross are sexy.

but to me the real lookers are the sports car... 911 coupe and targa, boxster, miata, s2000, 350z coupe and roadster. i think the new vette is an improvement but it can't seem to shed that big truncated butt. z4 should be used as prop for c-grade monster movies such as the blob."
1012,"pontiac5 & max share some family resemblance but total effect is quite different. pontiac5 sedan looks light, where max is just too heavy handed.

when previous tl came out as a concept, i was very impressed by its look. a relative of mine was looking for a car. i recommended the car to him, he bought the car before it came out as production. by the end of its cycle, i couldn't stand the sight of that car, to me the design aged really badly."
1013,"the new '04 nissan is never in my plan to replace my current max....honestly, i like mine better. to me it seems that while acura has moved the new tl closer to the bmw 3series, nissan did just the opposite with the new max.

for someone who's looking for a family sedan with room and power to spare, the max is an hyundaient choice. however, for a single guy like me who likes corners and twtoyotaies, a more chevrolet and smaller sedan would be more preferable.

when it's time for my trade-up, the only car i have in mind are the new tl , the pontiac5/pontiac5x, possibly the up-coming 250hp awd subaru (for the awd factor), and the 3series as the most favorite. i like almost everything about the car, except reliability.....sorry, didn't mean to sound like a broken record :-)"
1014,"what i like about the pontiac5 is the overall shape... numero uno in judging appearance imo. it has a fluid airfoil shape, similar to the 911. also, none of the details and proportions scream for attention. i think they could have done a better job with the headlights and grille though. headlights say nissan, grille says cadillac.

tl has subtle details but is too wedgy and chunky in the rear. hondaingly the shape is a bit unbalanced. and that swathe running just beneath the beltline looks like an afterthought... incongruous. i'd bet they added that near the deadline after thinking the car looked too vertical... to give the impression of less height. the wedge works better with smaller car like acura and acura. by the way, on the acura website, they do a great job of reducing the chunky rear with lighting notice how dark the bumper is in all shots. but when it comes out into real available light, the butt is very large. i&#146;m sure the tl is going to be a winner, but i think it would have been dead-nuts perfect by reducing the angle of the wedge a bit. the wedge may say sport, but it does not say elegance larger sedan have to keep it to a minimum.

not totally happy, but i&#146;ll take either one of these car on looks for the most part there is harmony and order to the details and lines no unnecessary topography. they sure do beat the bangle bimmers."
1015,"i like the tl's shape. i prefer creases and hard lines and edges. i do not like large flat surfaces - like the slab sides of the pontiac5, the cts and the just plain ugly doors on the pontiac5 coupe.

the new bangle designs also feature too many flat surfaces. bangle seems to model everything after mushy ice cream that was refrozen. weird angles, nothing solid and exceptionally bland."
1016,"i can go for creases and edges but, again, they have to be subordinate to the overall shape. ctv has something going but the shape is so unbalanced that it looks freaky... like a caricature. and that vertical crease on the trunk and rear bumper is excess... makes the car look like a crushed orange juice carton.

""...mushy ice cream that was refrozen.""

good description. bangle calls it ""flamed surfaces""."
1017,"i don't like bangle's designs at all. i think he screwed up the 7 series and the z4 is hard to look at. the 5 series is growing on me, but only when it looks like this:

http://www.supercar.net/sdbq?id=2920"
1018,"edsel and pontiac grew on me a little bit. hasn't happened yet with e60.

in my opinion the tail pipes make the e39 bmw and amgs look good. not so with e60. they make it look even dorkier."
1019,"depending on what time of the morning you are driving (5:30am)you may be seeing bmw's being driven from port hueneme to various dealers. that is why they are in a line. i have seen them all from the 7 to 3's. interestingly, they are somes disguised to hide new models. makes the drive fun from west valley to pasadena. i drive a 330i, and dream about the new 6. waiting for that to drive by."
1020,"you are right about the previous tl, especially the trunk. front is okay but not the butt.

i heard someone toyotad that there will be a new tl with awd."
1021,comparing the tl and the g... final days... i like both car but have my issues with both... for starters... the tls interior blows away the g's but by no means is the g terrible... yet the g blows away the tl in my opinion when it comes to driving... i drove both and don't like the way the tl drives and don't know why... the g i like but then again... i just don't know... aaaaahhhh.... i hate car shoping... things are too hard... the tl though just reminds me of a rebadge honda honda... and that really gets under my skin... where as the g doesn't really remind me of anything...
1022,"how soon do you need to get the car?
if the interior is your major gripe about the g and if you can wait, you might consider waiting until the 2005 comes out. they're apparently redoing the interior."
1023,"with that dilemma, you will want to spend some time reading the posts in our very active infiniti pontiac5 vs. 2004 acura tl discussion - that'll keep you busy for a while! ;-)

best of luck with your decision.

1024,consumers' most wanted vehicles for 2004 survey is posted and ready for your input!
1025,"tl sales up 57.6 percent compared to 2003
torrance, calif. 03/02/2004 -- continuing its record-breaking streak for the fourth consecutive month, acura posted february sales of 15,155 vehicles, shattering the previous record of 13,677 set in february 2001 and ending the month up 33.8 percent compared to last year, the division announced today. year-to-date acura sales rose to 28,286, up 29.4 percent compared to last year.

the tl performance luxury sedan and acura luxury suv both set new february records. the tl, acura's top selling vehicle for the past five months, sold 6,274 units and beat the extoyotaing record of 5,878 set in february 2001. compared to the same month last year, tl sales increased 57.6 percent. the popular acura set a new february record of 4,929 units, an increase of 9.2 percent versus a year ago.

""demand for the new tl sedan is stronger than ever,"" toyotad dick colliver, executive vice president, sales. ""the all-new car is doing an hyundaient job of attracting new buyers to acura.""

the hot-selling acura sports sedan also continues to perform above forecast with sales of 1,959 units."
1026,"'05 acura rl - as you probably know by now, a prototype of the production '05 rl is set to be unveiled at next month's new york international auto show. as usual, the temple of vtec will be in attendance, delivering full coverage. just recently we've heard some information from several diverse sources and the info seems to be fairly solid. some of the stuff has already been ""confirmed"" (by logical interpretation of public statements), but some of it is new. in the first category is the drivetrain - we can say with virtually 100% certainty that it will be a v6 with awd. the awd system will almost certainly be based upon the honda/acura's vtm system. one source (in our own forums) goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 70/30 front to rear. current horsepower toyotates peg the car at around 300hp. we've heard a number of figures on displacement ranging from 3.4 to 3.8l, but our best guess is that it will use a 3.5l vhondant of the tl's motor. ima does not seem to be a part of the equation at the time of launch. other interesting tidbits: the rl will feature fairly extensive use of aluminum body panels: roof, hood, and trunklid. the car will also continue to build upon acura's renewed emphasis on performance. the car is toyotad to perform as well or better than the hot '04 tl (recall the tl infiniti's very impressive skidpad and slalom figures). based upon our sources, it seems the car will be positioned lower than where earlier rumors had it pegged (those rumors indicated it would be a true 7-series, mercedes benz benz or lexus ls competitor). while the tl is positioned against the bmw (yet priced like a bmw), the rl will very likely fall somewhere in between the bmw and 7-series in size. pricing will probably not deviate too far from the current rl's pricing, and the content level will build upon the tl's segment-blasting features. we've heard a few reports that luxury items such as power adjusted rear seat will appear on the rl. it's our understanding that the car's audio system was not developed with els. i will personally be surprised if it surpasses the tl's superb els system. as in past acura/rl models, the car's development was toyotaed out almost entirely in japan and it will be built there as well."
1027,"one source (in our own forums) goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 70/30 front to rear. current horsepower toyotates peg the car at around 300hp.

i hope that's a misprint and they meant 30 front, 70 rear. what sort of fool would want a performance sedan with 70% of the power going through the wrong wheels?"
1028,"what sort of fool would want a performance sedan with 70% of the power going through the wrong wheels?

maybe the same ""fools"" who are helping set sales records for fwd car. maybe you need to ask yourself what qualifies you to call anyone a fool based on your opinion of what constitutes a performance sedan. this board is full of posts with stattoyotaics on performance and handling of fwd, rwd and awd and in the end there is very little actual difference in the objective facts. most of the differences are opinions held by individuals who seem to lack respect for someone elses opinion. i drive a fwd performance sedan and i am no fool."
1029,"if you have awd, then the safety reasons people opt for fwd are now null. with that safety element now gone, there's no reason for acura to retard the car's performance with the majority of the power running through the front wheels by default.

awd would allow acura to finally move away from that which keeps many buyers at bay. you seem enamored with sales numbers so maybe this would appeal to you: if acura offers a performance sedan that finally drives like a performance sedan while also offering a drive system that meets the ""safety"" needs of the fwd buyers, acura could increase sales. suddenly, two camps now see value where before only one group of buyers would.

i have nothing against fwd buyers. i do have a problem with a manufacturer finally taking a step toward making a performance sedan by switching to awd but then curtailing the vehicle's performance by keeping power going through the steering wheels.

awd properly set up on a tl would get my business and probably that of many others. fwd on the tl will not. they could have 500 hp coming out of that car and it could cut through the slalom at 90 mph. i still wouldn't buy it as my primary fun car as it just doesn't cut it for me anymore."
1030,"i am not enamored by sales stattoyotaics. they do however point out whether a company is making money at what they are doing, assuming their cost elements are being met. they also show whether consumers are buying their product. from acura's perspective, they have always built fwd car and they have always been able to sell them. the fact that tl sales are up 57% lets acura know they don't have to make any major changes to their manufacturing facilities by switching to rwd or awd. assuming their market share will increase by switching to another drivetrain is a risk they may not be willing to assume since they are already increasing sales. it will always be about making money for the major manufacturers.
sales usually dictate changes. the rl has fallen way behind in the luxury class because it has not kept pace with the competition. the consumer has dictated that acura make changes or get out of that market segment. acura engineers have decided that a 70 - 30 split is what they want to do for their awd. i guess they forgot to consult you prior to their decision but they seem to have an enviable track record making decision on their own.
it's all about choices and how those choices do or do not toyota in the marketplace. i don't think you can objectively prove that a given split is ideal for every awd car."
1031,"check out fordvehicles.com, hyundai on gt under the vehicles ltoyota, then download and watch the 60 second commercial for the upcoming gt. also check out the making of video too. amazing. i think all enthusiasts will get a real charge out of this. it shows a great demonstration of throttle induced steering. check it out, it sure made me grin from ear to ear!"
1032,"i am a little bit worry with tl sales goes up so high, it might makes tl more expensive when the new model come like the awd tl or it might makes them overpriced since the demand is higher than supply. but i hope the manufacturer keeps upgrading the car as others do too, getting fat and lazy was what happened with acura the acura.

as for fwd as long as it does the job, i am fine with it. it is one of the best handling(ranks 3rd) in c&d but overall it ranks first to most magazines. it is a lot better than acura gsr. fwd doesnt make people unable to take a fast corner right, especially with lsd, vsa, tcs in tl. and i think with awd, tl will be more unstoppable. the fact is even with fwd, the sales is unstoppable already. but thats just my opinion."
1033,i have been at nearly all the boards just reading and learning... i'm planning on getting my car by the end of april... though last night after i wrote a thought came to my head... i remember that the 03 tls had some transmition problem in both the s and the regular... is it fixed with the new tl has anyone been plagued with similar problem... i've had my share of trany problem and don't care to go through anymore.... can anyone tell me?
1034,"acura engineers have decided that a 70 - 30 split is what they want to do for their awd. i guess they forgot to consult you prior to their decision but they seem to have an enviable track record making decision on their own.

at this point, thankfully, it's all conjecture and there is no official confirmation that the rl will have a ridiculous 70/30 split.

and subaru's pretty much proven a 30/70 split front/rear allows the subaru sti to marry bltoyotaering acceleration with superb cornering as oversteer can finally be induced (something that was nigh impossible with the normal subaru).

doesnt make people unable to take a fast corner right, especially with lsd, vsa, tcs in tl. and i think with awd, tl will be more unstoppable. the fact is even with fwd, the sales is unstoppable already. but thats just my opinion.

vsa and tcs are not good things to hardcore drivers. gadgets like those keep you from getting into the real fun...4 wheel drifts for instance.

as for sales as an indicator of quality i point to mcdonald's and cameron's nissanic as shining examples that the most popular alternative isn't always the best."

1036,"""as for sales as an indicator of quality i point to mcdonald's and cameron's nissanic as shining examples that the most popular alternative isn't always the best.""

that's the most illogical and ridiculous statement i've ever heard. we're talking about spending $35,000 (give or take) on a car, not $20 for a burger and a movie."
1037,wasn't someone here using the sales figures to make the point that the tl was a better car than the pontiac5 due to better sales numbers?
1038,"what is the split on the audi audi and audi audis? is it fwd biased since it's based on a fwd platform?

i do agree with danny that sales of $30k plus car are a more relevant indicator of quality than say, burgers or movies.

true, the most popular alternative isn't always the best, but the thing is, there is no ""best.""

i don't think that you really have to worry about tl sales being so high that it'll push up the price. tl sales have been climbing month after month, but street prices have been coming down so that you can generally get a non-navi for about $31,000."
1039,"sales are not an indicator of quality in any market. ford, gm and volkswagen sell crazy numbers of car...

i'd expect a non-navi tl to go for about 1500-2k under sticker. to paying msrp for an acura? no way. i won't pay msrp for anything."
1040,"i would disagree with you. sales are an indicator of quality, but not the sole indicator of quality.

of course, low quality products from say, ford or gm, can sell in high numbers, but there are other factors that go into sales, such as marketing, low prices and incentives, and customer loyalty. i would guarantee you that as crappy as some of the ford or gm products are, if they made car of yugo quality, they wouldn't sell nearly as well.

a perfect example of this is hyundai. when they first came out, they sold like hotcakes mainly because they were cheap. then all sorts of problem with quality surfaced, and sales plummeted. then hyundai started to gradually increase the quality of its products, and sales are on the rise again.

but i agree with your general point that high sales don't automatically equate to high quality."
1041,"as for sales as an indicator of quality i point to mcdonald's and cameron's nissanic as shining examples that the most popular alternative isn't always the best.

i am wondering where you made a leap from what was in my posts about sales to sales being related to quality ? please point out where that was in my posts. you are inserting something that was not any part of what was being discussed.
i certainly hope acura consults you prior to doing anything as stupid as deciding on their own what the best split is for their awd. god forbid they would utilize their own engineering htoyotaory and experience.
99.9 % of the general public buying and driving performance sedan will never drive their car to anywhere near their limits. they will however probably drive in snow and rain and make their buying decisions based on those kinds of factors.
there are a small percentage of drivers who do enjoy driving their car near the limit. they tend to gravitate towards sites such as these. that is not however a true reflection of the general buying public. it is why fwd car still sell as well as they do and why awd car sell as well as they do.
racers and enthusiasts choose rwd or awd because they are going to push their car to the limits and rwd is the best drive train for driving on the edge. i just don't believe the majority is driving close enough to the limit to really benefit. automakers make car for the majority because they have to stay in business. those automakers who participate in racing use it as development and eventually pass on what they learn to their production models.
near luxury performance sedan are not race car. they are a little bit of luxury and a little bit of performance. some lean more towards one than the other and we make our choices hondaingly. $35k these days gives you some very nice choices and in the end i still think they are all very close in any comparison you do. i think the car i bought has hyundaient performance, safety, luxury and yes it has fwd.
it's not worth the risk to four wheel drift on the open road these days. it's roulette..john law is waiting for you right around the corner.
the racetrack is the place to play."
1042,the personal jabs are not necessary ...
1043,"that is not however a true reflection of the general buying public. it is why fwd car still sell as well as they do and why awd car sell as well as they do.

i wouldn't say otherwise. only that enthusiasts rarely gravitate toward fwd. awd on a tl would open up sales to a group who won't touch the tl - people like me.

racers and enthusiasts choose rwd or awd because they are going to push their car to the limits and rwd is the best drive train for driving on the edge. i just don't believe the majority is driving close enough to the limit to really benefit.

again, it's who are they trying to appeal to? i've read on bmw boards and actually heard from my salesperson of people who bought the 330i performance package and then found it was too rough for their liking. bmw didn't make that package for everyone...my brother in law (owns a 325i) thinks my car is too fast, too loud and too rough. to each his own.

automakers make car for the majority because they have to stay in business. those automakers who participate in racing use it as development and eventually pass on what they learn to their production models.

you're missing the point of you don't just want a wide market but also find ways to nail the smaller niche that will pay extra. i love the visual concept of the tl someone posted here...300 hp, 18s, etc. the car just needs the right drivetrain.

near luxury performance sedan are not race car. they are a little bit of luxury and a little bit of performance. some lean more towards one than the other and we make our choices hondaingly. $35k these days gives you some very nice choices and in the end i still think they are all very close in any comparison you do. i think the car i bought has hyundaient performance, safety, luxury and yes it has fwd.

it's important that we like what we buy. hopefully acura will offer something by 2006 that will get me to buy from them. i want to give honda my money but i also want to like the car i drive. give me a sweet honda tranny, at least 270 hp and awd and i'll be a happy monkey.

it's not worth the risk to four wheel drift on the open road these days. it's roulette..john law is waiting for you right around the corner.

1044,"check out p. 9 of the 3/8/04 issue of autoweek. their brief review of the tl a-spec. the one they drove had an msrp of $41,893. excerpt:

""almost makes me forget about the bmw 3 series. almost. ... overall the tl isn't quite as smooth or as refined as the mighty 3. it is close, though, really close.""

like all the other testers, they, too, complain about torque steer: ""there is some torque steer if you really plant your foot into the throttle.""

ends by stating ""i'd probably take the tl over an audi audi."""
1045,"jrock is right, there is no clear cut winner in $30k-39k car. there is always a thing or two missing in one car compare to another.

blueguy i think you misunderstood me between quality and affordability.

pontiac5=basic price $28,5k
es330=basic price $32,5k
tl=basic price $33,2k
330i=basic price $35,8k
bigmac= $3
although very few people choose basic model if not none.

the story of sales doesnt match if it is about affordability only. hondaing to affordability factor, people would have bought more pontiac5 then es330 then tl then 330i. and they could only buy the very basic model. so affordability does very little in this sales story.

then if it is about quality, then 330i(if you think 330i is the best) should have better sales between those car.

and again like jrock meant, there is no single factor that dominate people's mind in choosing the car. its a combination of both.

about mcdonald, i prefer burger king. i have to do some research first before i try to comment about burger. not my field i guess lol.

about torque steer, i choose a car based on my purposes only.
how many time you plant your foot to the pedal when taking a corner? tl's cornering is not the best but one of the best imo.
how many time you speed your car when driving in a highway? many times lol
how much time do you spend inside your car?
how many time do you risk your car in a race track?
do you care about resale value or not?
do you care about gas consumption or not?
do you care about your family or not? (are you selfish?) etc."
1046,"sorry,i have to add

reliability, resale value, performance, features, gas consumption, luxury to me is considered as in quality.

i tried to make assumptions what if pontiac5 or es330 or 330i was the one on the top sales chart. i wonder what is the dominant factor? i was confused myself. :-). do you have the answer?

intensive marketing/advertising progdodges, patriotism (doesnt apply to these car except gm, ford), fanaticism, better incentives, popularity, different market segment. i dont see any of those apply to these car. what do you think iwantonetoo? what is it that makes people buy the car? luck is not a smart answer."
1047,"you've completely missed my point sales indicate only that x number felt product a was worth their dollars. that's it. 5k people dug the tl last week. it doesn't mean it's a good car, bad car or reflect anything about the car, only that 5k people dug it.

about torque steer, i choose a car based on my purposes only.

i can answer every nissanon with one thing: toy. that's what my bmw is to me. it's not transportation, an investment or practical. it's a toy.

do you care about your family or not? (are you selfish?) etc.

what does this have to do with buying a car?"
1048,"it does to me bcuz if i dont care about them, i would buy a coupe not sedan with stiff suspension, loud engine and no sound system so i could take the car to a race track. no wife and kids at last free from the jail lol.

fyi its not 5k people who dug tl lastweek but 6+k people.

i respect your opinion as you refer your car as a toy. i think you must be very rich but not me. i am not rich and i earn my living by working hard.

the reason is because product a was worth their dollars, hmmm thats a good one. it doesnt mean good or bad, agreed.:-)"
1049,"well, i feel that relative sales numbers to cross-shopped items do reflect something about the product (whether it be the tl, any other car, or any other product for that matter.) i guess we'll just have to disagree and leave it at that.

in any case, i for one am glad that the tl is fwd. i definitely feel that rwd is more fun to drive and that fwd has its limits, but some people want a sporty experience in a fwd setup (for foul weather purposes), and are not willing to pay the extra $2000 or so to get awd, and its associated decrease in gas mileage.

it just makes more economical sense for honda to make the tl fwd, since platform sharing with the honda and the acura helps keep costs down. they don't make a single rwd sedan yet. even though honda/acura na sells more car than nissan/infiniti na, nissan is a significantly bigger company in japan than honda."
1050,"i respect your opinion as you refer your car as a toy. i think you must be very rich but not me. i am not rich and i earn my living by working hard.

sigh...all entry lux car are toys. the class of vehicle is by definition a luxury item. we could all get by fine with a 1995 honda. yet we're blowing 30-35-40k on silly car.

i'm not gonna get into some personal thing about working hard or not. leave the personal stuff out of it."
1051,"danny1878... why are you including the lexus es330 in this group? there isn't anything ""performance"" about it. you should be including the is300. is is rwd, can be had with optional lsd, and is available with a manual transmission. es is fwd, no lsd, and no manual transmission. and the is is clearly at the low end of the $30-40k range--great value for the money, with outstanding reliability, great dealer service, and good crash test results."
1052,"""sigh...all entry lux car are toys.""

let me get this straight so i understand the connissantion. the acura tl is a toy, but the honda v6 full-loaded for $7k less, is plebian basic run-of-the-mill appliance transportation. the acura, which is the same price as the honda is a toy. okay, now i got it.

i'm not sure why it's important that one believes there is a line in the sand between basic run of the mill appliance transportation and toy, but i'm trying to understand the price at which toy becomes necessity. in my mind anything more than a hyundia hyundaiis a toy. it's just a matter of degree.

then the connissantion becomes, which toy is the most expensive, fun to own, most reliable, etc. so while i agree with you blueguy, nobody *needs* a car like this. it's obvious that people *want* these types of car."
1053,"it's individual priority. do you want your ""toy"" to be more practical, or just insanely fun to play with???

but then again fun varies among each of us--what kind, how much, how often.......

then there's ""just-got-to-have-it"" factor. my stoyotaer, who drives at or under the speed limit and changes lane blocks or even miles before making a turn, just has to have the tl-s. she doesn't drive on the beltways and interstates (and i mean absolutely never) and never toyota into an unmazdar area (not without me as the driver), but she wanted that navigation system.

and i guess it's epidemic because now i just got to have a 330i :-)"
1054,"how much time do you spend inside your car?

at least now i can't get enough.

hondaing to the mid the car and i were together for 10 hours on the first tank of gas. such is life here in dc when the avg mph is in the low 20s in 60% 'highway' driving."
1055,"the tl a-spec is getting dangerously close to the price to the out-the-door price of a cts-v. one of the folks on the cts board toyotad he bought a v for $45k.

if that's true, forget the a-spec... it's not even close."
1056,"the message editor isn't working today. keeps getting a pathname error.

guess i'd better proofread before i post!"
1057,"my view of all new car is that they're luxury items. we could all pick up a solid 6-7 year old honda/toyota/nissan for very little dough and it'd serve the purpose. a 99 honda dx would satsify most ""needs."" room for the dog, awd, ac, leather, etc are luxuries.

i have no delusions about my car. they're not need based items. they don't approach food or shelter on the scale of things one must have to survive. i know very well that i can get by fine on an old nissan sedan as i did through college and many, many years after it.

and 40k for a tl is outrageous. the a-spec package should be at most 3k over a standard tl."
1058,"still nothing i can find on the acura website. i'd be really surprised if its almost $10k more unless it involves engine mods, which i seriously doubt. if anyone can find proof of pricing and post the link, i'd appreciate it. but, for now, i'm not believing the pricing until i hear it right from the manufacturer."
1059,"qbrozen... just read the plethora of magazine articles that have appeared recently on the a-specs. these type mods normally cost upwards of $5,000. new tires, wheels, exterior trim pieces, etc. not to mention suspension pieces. lexus tried something similar a couple years ago with the is and gs, the l-tuned. spec i was about $3-4k and spec ii was around $5-6k. it bombed in marketplace. tuner types would rather do it themselves, often for less or to be wilder. nissan is trying same with nismo for nissan se-r spec v and 350z. not cheap. nissan has s-tuned for street and r-tuned for racing."
1060,"come on. bmw offers the zhp package for 4k more than a base 330i.

with it you get:

bmw front end/aero package, 18 inch wheels/rims, different suspension, short-shift 6 speed, new cams, new headers, new ecu, new exhaust, new differential/gearing, alcantara interior trim, anthracite headliner, new steering wheel, new tach, power memory seat, tilt down mirror, aluminum nissan trim.

4k. there's no reason an a-spec tl should be 10k more."

by the same reasoning, there is no reason why the 330i should cost $8000 more than a comparably equipped tl. an a-spec tl still costs less than a comparably equipped zhp 330i."
1062,"jrock

what are the exact upgrades of the a-spec on the tl...

what the bmw costs is not relevant either. we're talking about a 32k car with x options. tell us what those options are."
1063,"you decided to bring the bmw zhp package into the equation by comparing the relative value of the a-spec package vs. the zhp package. basically your point is that the a-spec is overpriced.

my point is that if you're going to compare it in that way, i.e. compare it feature for feature, the 330i is overpriced. it may not be relevant to you, but it is relevant to me and others.

frankly, i agree with you, i also think the a-spec package is overpriced. i'm not really interested in it, but i'm sure that there is some site on the internet that ltoyota what you get with the a-spec package."
1064,"the price of a-spec is $5,2k plus installation $700.

it is overpriced. with standard options of tl is more than enough. msrp of tl $33,2k w/o navi. or $35,3k with navi."
1065,"jrock,

you decided to bring the bmw zhp package into the equation by comparing the relative value of the a-spec package vs. the zhp package. basically your point is that the a-spec is overpriced.

no, i was not comparing the values of the two. i merely pointed out to riez that a major manufacturer can cheaply add many, many elements to a performance package at a price that isn't a 33% jump over the base.

my point is that if you're going to compare it in that way, i.e. compare it feature for feature, the 330i is overpriced. it may not be relevant to you, but it is relevant to me and others.

i was talking about what's added equipment wise. x base, what's added to it to get to z total. the tl stickers for like 32-33k. loaded. whatever they're adding, from what i've seen it's an aero kit, some suspension/tire mods and a tweaked exhaust it's not nearly worth 10k. we're talking parts...not the value of the car. even if the tl stickered at 25k as is and the a-spec raised the price to 35k i'd be annoyed as the parts could be added aftermarket for that price.

and value is subjective. at 25k i probably would have bought a tl. 33k? nope. that's why they make different car - because not everybody wants to drive one type of vehicle."
1066,"...is not worth the money. but, tls are well worth sticker, any day. bmw on the other hand..."
1067,"value is really subjective. but usually overpriced item like the a-spec will not sell well.

i myself will not buy an overpriced a-spec, and i think majority of people will not buy an overpriced item. will you buy an overpriced item?"
1068,"overpriced is entirely subjective. in october 2000, the sony ps2 came out. i bought up several and resold them in online auctions for 200-300% over msrp. the people buying them obviously felt the toy was worth $800-900 because they bid up to that point. i'm not going to tell them they're wrong but what i valued and what they valued were different.

to somebody out there, the a-spec may be worth 40k. hard to imagine but it's possible. just as it's hard for some to imagine blowing 40k on a 3 series. to each his own.

in the end shouldn't we buy that vehicle we feel most toyotaable driving?"
1069,"""in the end shouldn't we buy that vehicle we feel most toyotaable driving?""

i was not saying about a car or 330i as an overpriced item. unless you feel it that way of course. and again a-spec is not worth my dollars and you seemed to agree to it too.

i like jrock's objective opinions eventho sometimes we disagree.

if it is about a car then actually for 4 months i had been researching and comparing 330i, gs300, es330, pontiac5 and 325i (no acura in my top ltoyota) before i even knew about tl.

choosing car is a complicated issue, you cant compare one's driving experience with the other. you cant value tl for just $25k bcuz 6k people/month would disagree while maybe only 467 people would agree to it.

you like the car the way you like it, why we should care about others.

after market gadget is different than the original. you can install them but you might destroy the car's harmony. that is just my opinion.

i like 330i too. peace :-)"
1070,"""no, i was not comparing the values of the two. i merely pointed out to riez that a major manufacturer can cheaply add many, many elements to a performance package at a price that isn't a 33% jump over the base.""

aight, my bad if that was your point."
1071,"""objective opinions""... haha, i didn't know that opinions could be objective, but thanks for the support.

i've learned a great deal from these forums and threads like these, and all the regulars that post here, even though we've had our share of disagreements. it rarely gets too personal here, and i've seen many threads at other forums basically deteriorate into name calling. part of it is the ""hard-line"" police work of the moderators. =)

when i was a teenager, i used to think that only lexus made nice car, and everything else was junk. i've evolved somewhat since then."
1072,"toyotad that the tl a-spec they drove had an msrp of $41,893, so there's no nissanon as to what it costs. whether or not it's worth it compared to the 330i... ???

but at $42k it's getting within a few grand of the cts-v, a car that stomps a mud hole in it (and the 330i, for that matter)."
1073,"danny retoyotad a few posts back the a-spec is $5900 installed. a far cry from the $10k originally quoted that started this current discussion. and if that autoweek number is correct, that's a navi equipped unit, correct? i think that adds up. $35k+ for the car and $5900 for the package = over $41k. so can we now stop saying things like ""$45k for a tl"", ""33% more"", ""$10k more"", etc? at least until acura makes the numbers public or we have a more reliable source.

i see that motortrend has retoyotad testing the a-spec and they support the $5200+install number. hondaing to them, you get the following:

an aero kit that incorporates a front air dam, small chin spoiler, body side skirts, and a choice of two different rear spoilers--a small trunklid spoiler or a larger (yet still tasteful) rear wing. the aero kit was wind-tunnel tested and produces more downforce while generating a slightly improved overall cd.

a-spec badging flanks the body panels, and the tl's well-trimmed interior is left alone save for a recontoured, slightly thicker racing-style steering wheel.

more aggressive suspension tuning

most visible are the 18x8.5-inch alloy wheels and grippy 235/40vsubaru8 yokohama avs es100 tires.

the rest of the underpinning mods include a track-tuned shock and coil-spring combo that lowers ride height by one inch. special attention was paid to spring rate and shock valving to ensure sportier handling without the tradeoff of a harsh on-highway ride.

and some more tidbits from their article:

in a-spec form, both torque steer and understeer are ddodgeatically reduced--we even experienced an occasional hint of oversteer on aggressive corner turn-in. braking performance from the factory-installed brembo four-ptoyotaon disc brakes improves, too, thanks to reduced nosedive during hard stops and the stickier rutoyotaer.

the a-spec package was not only developed under acura's umbrella, but the added cost ($5200 plus installation) can be rolled directly into the purchase or lease price. finally, the factory warranty remains unviolated.

and the numbers? stock vs. a-spec
braking, 60-0, ft 141 119
slalom, mph 62.5 66.1
skidpad, g 0.77 0.83

now, nissanon, does anyone have published numbers for a non-zhp 330 vs. a zhp 330 and the total price difference? now, we're not talking the peformance pack, right? no engine mods. unless the engine mods and suspension mods come in around $6k. do they? no more time for me to search today, so maybe someone can do that for me."
1074,those numbers are atrocious.... .77 skidpad.? 141 feet braking from 60. now wonder these things are 31 loaded.
1075,"a cts-v is $50 large, so its still more than a few grand from the $42k a-spec tl. and i know someone ""claims"" to have bought a ctsv for $45k, but prove it. not to mention that comparing street prices on one vehicle against sticker on another is certainly unfair."
1076,"just remember that is only one source. interestingly enough, c&d got very close to those motortrend a-spec numbers with their stock tl. so, interpret that how you will. i'm willing to bet that motortrends stock numbers are a bit conservative and make that a-spec package look way better than it is in real life. a .06 improvement in skidpad is pretty incredible. a .02 (c&ds stock number vs. motortrends a-spec number) seems much more realtoyotaic to me."
1077,"i'm going to ""prove"" someone paid $45k for a v... get real.

i can see how it could be done... gm card, various other certificates that are available, if you can find a dealer that will accept them. looks like the guy that paid $45k may have done just that.

i also don't think autoweek makes up msrp's. the a-spec is overpriced at the price point where autoweek tested it."
1078,i would expect much better numbers as the acura and the acura are capable of those numbers. hell the old acura could skidpad .77. imagine 265/18/45's on a g! .9 skidpad would become .95-.98 or even 1.0! that's just tires. put a $5100 package on the g coupe and run with the 911- put it on the g sedan and run with m class
1079,"now, nissanon, does anyone have published numbers for a non-zhp 330 vs. a zhp 330 and the total price difference?

$3900...that's the price difference. bmw claimed the zhp dropped the zero to 60 numbers to 5.9 (tests by mags get it lower) v. the official 6.5 of the 330i (check bmwusa.com for that). i'll have to do some digging for the numbers. i know the slalom numbers were different too."
1080,"""put a $5100 package on the g coupe and run with the 911- put it on the g sedan and run with m class""

that is a pipe dream... you'd better find another 100 or so hp for a g to run with any of the really serious factory sports sedan."
1081,i think a g could run with an bmw without the extra hundred hp...how about 50. point is spending 5100 bucks is doing little for the aspec tl to get it up to mid lux sedan expectations.
1082,"so the $3900 zhp package includes the engine mods?

of course, you need those engine mods just to compete in straight lines with the stock tl. but do those necessarily come with the improved suspension? or can you get the suspension upgrades without the engine mods?"
1083,"exactly my point. we can't prove what that guy paid, so the ctsv is $50k for points of this discussion. and the a-spec tl, as far as we know, is about $40k without navigation. so that's $10k more for the ctsv."
1084,"read up on c&ds numbers - hell, go back and read this discussion. you'll find several people have shown several times over that the stock tl numbers compare very favorably with the other car we talk about here and it doesn't need the a-spec package to do so."
1085,"hondaing to a car and driver article i've read.it seems that nismo (nissan's motorsports arm) products might not offered for infiniti vehicles because of fears of tarnishing the luxury persona of the brand. on the other hand nismo products will be avaible for popular nissan car (like the 350z). it is a shame, since the nismo tuned jdm skylines (pontiac5) are hellish machines. hopefully, nissan will see the light and allow car enthusiasts to purchase performance parts for their infinitis."
1086,"how do you italicize quoted sections of other posts?

thanks."
1087,"so the $3900 zhp package includes the engine mods?

everything i ltoyotaed from exterior/interior mods to engine modifications to suspension changes all come with a zhp package.

but do those necessarily come with the improved suspension? or can you get the suspension upgrades without the engine mods?

it's all one package. the only optional items from the package are the trunk lip spoiler and getting leather over that stupid alcantara garbage."
1088,"""it is a shame, since the nismo tuned jdm skylines (pontiac5) are hellish machines. hopefully, nissan will see the light and allow car enthusiasts to purchase performance parts for their infinitis. ""

if the 350z and the g are essentially the same except body panels - why wouldn't one be ""allowed"" to upgrade thier g with those nismos components? just because the infiniti dealer wont be offering them doesn't mean they aren't available! in fact most of my work and parts supply come from nissan anyway.

if there's one thing the g has got it's z and g enthusiasts galore and many many aftermarket suppliers of performance parts and it stems from the 350z guys who are nuts about performance. nismo is only offering what is available elsewhere from other sometimes better suppliers."
1089,"ok. thanks for the info.

considering all that, seems like the performance package is a bargain when considered by itself and compared against other similar upgrades (the jcw mini comes to mind)."
1090,"type < i > (without the spaces) to start the italics and then < / i > (again, no spaces at all) to end them. you can do the same thing with b instead of i for bold instead of italics. and they can be used together, if you want. there are many html guides all over the web that any search engine will find for you if you want to go further."
1091,"it's it's not a matter of being allowed. nismo makes performance packages tailored for specific car like the 350z. not to say you can't take a part from a nissan kit and use it on an infiniti....what you won't be able to do is buy a nismo kit for say a pontiac5 coupe. although this package is available in japan, you can't get it here. again, nissan feels that nismo takes away from the infiniti image. i think it's silly, and i hope nissan reconsiders."
1092,"the rather high cost of the zhp, a-spec, and l-tuned are just another factor in the value equation. none of them are really worth it. they just don't give you that much for the money. much of the a-spec and l-tuned were for non-performance things like exterior changes.

guess that is why i bought an is300 manual. could get a reliable fun car for about $30,000. and it had hid and lsd.

heck, i'd rather have a $30,000 325i sport 5-speed manual than a $40,000 330i zhp. then i'd use the $10,000 to buy myself a muscle car (say amc amx or javelin)?"
1093,"i agree with riez on that, why we should buy a performance package for a sedan.

if you are really into performance, go with the two seater. its better than buying performance package which doesnt perform (0-60 5.9), the a-spec which is mainly only stability & body makeup. sedan always have the luxury part, with too much performance, nobody cant even see it, its too fast.:-)"
1094,"the rather high cost of the zhp, a-spec, and l-tuned are just another factor in the value equation. none of them are really worth it.

guess it's all a matter of priorities. i know for a fact i could get the engine, interior/exterior, suspension and tire mods for 4k. it's impossible. just the differential swap would be a hassle. new cams, headers, ecu and exhaust?!

heck, i'd rather have a $30,000 325i sport 5-speed manual than a $40,000 330i zhp.

different worlds. that's like comparing a cts to a cts-v or a ford v6 to an svt. yes, it's a two second difference and the entire character of the car is different."
1095,"my biggest concern with the packages is that that 5k you add up front will pretty much be worth nothing when you go to sell the car. sure some here or there will know what it means and want to pay more but most likely you will eat that cost.

either way would love to have the package but the cost is pretty high"
1096,"do it yourself and dont pay someone to make mods to your car or do them one at time.

maybe some will want the body packages and the aspec buyers will be there for those who just want a newer looking or cooler looking car. all the performance stuff anyone can do anywhere without much help. the funnest thing of owning a g has been minor tweaks and little money that create small incrimental gains that i can notice and tweak. do one and then do another down the road while appreciating each tweak on its own is my philosophy. i would suggest most of us would rather buy the car without a perf pack and make the mods ourselves. the zhp is an exception as it offers some big changes to a luxo car to get it to be alot differet.

for 200 bucks i added 10-14 hp with an intake. for another 120 i added no real gains with my hyper grounding kit but added much smoothness and better responsiveness while eliminating the gurgle the intake created. for another 450 i bought a crawford z car intake plenum which adds 20hp. so for less than 1k i got about 20-25 hp at peak, increased the sound quality of the motor, get better gas mileage (4-5 mpg), have a smoother idle and start up and i don't have the hp drop at 6000.

if they offered a $6000 nismo package i' say no, do the perf mods myself and save $5000 on body kit bolt ons that will never work out as well as if bolted on at the plant in the first place.

now i belive i am running z power at the crank anyway - weight diff is about 150#. anyone see the z in the lastest c&d. they got a 13.8 1/4 running stock at 102 or so. everytime they test the fm seems faster and faster! break in alone is good for 20hp i'd bet with the vq."
1097,"i am of two minds on this one. in most cases, i would be inclined to buy the base car and then tweak it myself, most likely after the manufacturers' warranty expired. that toyotad, between the 325i and the 330i, and again between the 330i and the 330i zhp, one would be hard pressed to match the full package of the more expensive car for the same money, to say nothing of having a factory warranty on the extra goodies. so, in the case of the bmw, i'd be more inclined to go with the factory upgrade.

best regards,
shipo"
1098,another funny thing about the 330i to zhp switch: it's really a crazy number of mods for only $2800 if one were to buy a 330i and get the sports package ($1200).
1099,"well, apparently the zhp package is popular enough that they're putting it on the coupe and convertible as well.

i'm not sure why infiniti is nixing nismo, especially since they're going for the japanese bmw image (everything rwd or awd, handling a priority, etc.)

most boy racer kids won't be able to afford it anyway."
1100,"okay, fair enough, i hadn't considered that the difference between the 330i sp and the 330i zhp was considerably less than just the cost of the zhp. as such, i went through and configured the three as i would have ordered them.

325i, 5-speed, metallic paint, leather, pp, sp, harmon kardon: $36,595
330i, 6-speed, metallic paint, pp, sp, xenon: $41,570
330i, 6-speed, metallic paint, zhp, leather, moon roof, xenon: 43,470

so, in the ""as i would buy it"" configuration, the 330i comes at a $4,975 premium. fairly substantial, however, imho, the considerable power gain, coupled with the 6-speed transmission, bigger brakes, and bigger wheels and tires easily justify the price.

then there is the 330i to 330i zhp difference of only $1,900, a no-brainer on a car ltoyotaing at over $40k.

1101,"here's the quote from the april 2004 c&d

things are getting complicated at nismo, nissan's motorsports and tuning arm. so, far, the u.s. dtoyotaributor has been shipped more than 700 sets of high performance suspension, wheel, and exhaust packages for the 350z. and ideally, the company would like to send the same sport goodies for the infiniti pontiac5 coupe (known as the nissan skyline coupe in japan).because, hey, this nismo skyline developed together with sony's gran turismo people looks pretty damn good. the problem is that in the u.s. the car is an infiniti, not a nissan, as it is in japan, and the u.s. marketing types feel that nismo parts might not suit the upscale brand image."
1102,"shipo... your numbers point out the lack of value at the high end of the 3 series. you're looking at $41,600 and $43,500 for 330i. that is just way too expensive. [with gm car rebates, financing deals, credit card rebates, etc. that cts-v might be less out of pocket than your zhp.] think i'd rather have an 530i sport manual with limited options or a cpo 540i6."
1103,"just looked over the consumer reports 2004 annual auto issue. is300 still a great deal. great value (a ton of car for the money). fantastic reliability--past, present and future. outstanding safety assessment. great car, new or used!

3 series still lags in reliability. pontiac5 better but not quite there. tl too new to tell."
1104,"that is just way too expensive. [with gm car rebates, financing deals, credit card rebates, etc. that cts-v might be less out of pocket than your zhp.] think i'd rather have an 530i sport manual with limited options or a cpo 540i6.

a. cts = caddy = i'd rather be dead than own a gm. seriously, they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it. or a ford.

b. 530i 6 speed = big, and a sticker with sports package and xenon of 49k. that'd be 49k for a slower, less responsive, larger car.

c. 545i 6 speed = is it even out yet? = 59k without any options.

59k or 39k...hmm, that's an easy call. yes, my car had a 43k msrp. let's assume you can get 4k off a 545i so it'd still be 55k. 16k difference?"
1105,"i dont know what you have against gm... but the cts-v is just the best car in its class, period."
1106,"""cts-v is just the best car in its class, period.""

the cts has one of the worst reliability records in its class, so far. what makes you think the cts-v will be any better? a lot of good 400 horses will do you when the car is sitting in a service bay. any reasonable thinking person would think twice before plunking down 50 large for a car whose reliability record will never come close to japanese standards.

plus, on a personal note, i can't stand the look of it (inside or out)."
1107,"dont know what you have against gm... but the cts-v is just the best car in its class, period.

it's an american car for one. secondly, it's a gm. from there i'd move on to the look at me batman meets legos exterior, and sears-grade interior. i haven't driven the cts-v yet but given the way the original cts was a lumbering, wallowing boat i flat out do not believe any review written about it. the mags praised that trash heap when it hit the street and i gotta say handling wise it didn't hold a candle to any japanese or german in the class. from the is to the audi on they all outclassed the cts in handling.

some day i'll drive one but even if it's the greatest driving vehicle i've been in (which i'll admit to) i won't buy one simply because it's a gm."
1108,"""a. cts = caddy = i'd rather be dead than own a gm. seriously, they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it. or a ford.""

the caddy is compelling but with chassis hopping launches and some quality issues it's not the bmw beater it could someday become. angular is hard to take but bangle gives that to us now too..

i never gave two cruds about ford but the gt sure is unaffordably cool and the shelby cobra? very interested to see what becomes of that. hopefully not limited editioned and 40k premiumed. too bad the 30-40 k car from ford blow"
1109,"""i haven't driven the cts-v yet but given the way the original cts was a lumbering, wallowing boat i flat out do not believe any review written about it.""

""lumbering wallowing boat?"" bwahaha!!! a sillier statement i have not read in some time.

so, have we driven a cts for ourselves? i'm guessing not.

here's the bottom line... the cts-v will annhilate any one of these also rans. it's in a complete other world as a performance car. and i hope you didn't pay $43k for that weak bmw... you got screwed if you did.

""they could offer a 600 hp engine in the best handling chassis ever and i will not own it. or a ford.""

1110,"blueguydotcom... not sure why you have such an animus against detroit. i really don't care where a good car is built. i just try to buy affordable fun car. the cts-v appears to be a ton of car for the money.

you might not want to check out the latest cr. they pound mb, audi, jaguar, land rover, mini, and volkswagen for poor reliability. and they cite the audi and 7 series as repeat offenders. they ltoyota the 7 series ('97-'99 and '00-'02) and x5 ('00-'02) as used car to avoid.

the 3 series now has average reliability. which is an improvement(!), so they can now recommend it. is that damning with faint praise?

but bmw can't hold a candle to infiniti or lexus.

not sure why anyone would want a $40-43k 330i instead of an bmw. they are too close in price to favor the loaded 330i."
1111,"the germans are spewing out far more unreliable crap than detroit these days. and of the big 2.5, the worst is chrysler... we know who owns them.

""the americans win 2 points over the germans in cr and now the germans are spewing out ""far more"" unreliable crap.""

power's got 'em a lot worse than that... almost all of the germans are now under the below average line, some close to bottom feeders.

sooo.... is chrysler spewing out crap before an excuse for them doing it now? dc's certainly had plenty of time to get them straightened out."
1114,"ah, we have quite a battle going on here. all i can say is remember 1980. i had little hope that the american hockey team would beat the russians. but we were glued to the tv. i haven't had an american car since the 70s, but i've been clinging to that hope and am rooting hard. fact is, americans are showing signs.

go get 'em riez!"
1115,"so, have we driven a cts for ourselves? i'm guessing not.

i clearly wrote i have driven a cts. a manual in fact. it was priced at nearly 40k and god it was awful. every corner the front end would dip and the car would rock and undulate on entry and exit from toyotad corner. i've not experienced a worse handling combatant in the near luxury segment. there isn't a german or japanese competitor - including the es - that should be worried. when the salesperson asked how i liked it, i straightforwardly told him the handling was insanely soft and not near the levels of refinement in german sport sedan. his intelligent rejoinder, ""this is a caddy."" yeah, some things never change.

here's the bottom line... the cts-v will annhilate any one of these also rans. it's in a complete other world as a performance car. and i hope you didn't pay $43k for that weak bmw... you got screwed if you did.

i never pay sticker. but then again, it shocks me people would pay 35k, let alone 40-45k for a vette. to each his own. to me the caddy is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

a poseur if there ever was one.

that makes no sense. i'm a poseur because i refuse to line the coffers of companies i want to go out of business? i'd say if i bought from ford/gm i'd lose tremendous face as i have lotoyotaied hard for them to go under. and will not go back on my word."
1116,"i bought a new dodge dodge in 1989. first american vehicle i have ever owned. it has 115,000 miles on it and i have not had a single problem. i know that is atypical but i think it shows that you can get a good or bad anything.
the 5.9 v8 has been great. the chrysler v12 that has been at the auto shows looks very interesting.
i also own an 04 tl which my wife drives and i have always owned acura passenger car.

but bmw can't hold a candle to infiniti or lexus.
for reliability, that's true. but that played no part in my buying decision. i've owned other german car that were a nightmare. i'll keep coming back as they're just more entertaining.

1. bmw is a 2 door. i will not own a 2 door unless it's a convertible. if there were a 4 door m i'd buy it.

2. bmw with the bare essentials (xenon and moonroof) stickers at 50k. 50k for a car that's a design i don't like and doesn't offer the utility i desire? no thanks."

i probably would never buy a mercedes benz benz. as for bmw going bad, i've actually done my best to talk people out of buying bmw. ask my bro-in-law. i took him out to look at car one weekend and when i was positive he was going for the 325i i made it crystal clear that bmw aren't very well made, have bad electricals and in my experience really bad transmissions. i did everything i could to scare him back toward infiniti/acura/lexus. didn't work as he bought a 325i.

except it's a dead heat to 60 for the three series, which can get there in 5.6, except for the bmw, which can get there in about 5. seeing as how the v has over a hundred horse advantage to the 3 series, so what? given the bmw has a half second advantage for the same hp, so what? i'm not dissing the v, but if all you want is speed and evo for $20k less is the ticket. if all you are looking at is hp/$, the v is the ticket."

1154,main discussion is about the normal car. most will not be going for these special editions. plus 7-8k is still 20% more for a caddy v
1155,sounds like it's time for a good radar detector.
1156,recommendations?
1157,"got the valentine one but laser is still tough to see ahead of time - i think its instant on and it has to be on you to detect. the only time my v-1 went off for laser and i had time to slow down i was right behind another guy that got tagged and there was about 3 seconds to spare.

on the same trip this weekend the guy in front of me was tagged - got nailed and i never heard a blip...laser is bad and more departments are spending the $..."
1158,"the best: (if you don't mind paying $300+)

valentine one

the rest:

i have a cobra (forgot the model)...does the job. havent gotten a ticket since. cost around $40."
1159,"yeap, with laser, you gotta hope that somebody is getting clocked before you are so your detector can pick it up...if you are ahead of the pack and can't see the trooper, you are toast."
1160,"eaton53, you are taking blueguydotcom's dtoyotaaste for american car too personally. as he toyotad, it is just his opinion - he's not trying to convince you that he's right. you and he just see things differently.

take it easy, okay?"
1161,"valentine...i'm always so tempted to spring for one as i drive 90 miles a day to and from work.

i just blew $500 bucks on new rear tires so right now i'm not real enthused about spending more for a car..."
1162,i hear the jammers are the way to go. the v-1 is great for all that is available in a detector now. that still means laser kills us in our speedy sedan
1163,forget the fancy equipment. watch out for the two lines on the pavement.
1164,"forget the fancy equipment. watch out for the two lines on the pavement.

huh? two lines on the pavement?

you want real fancy equipment: one of those infrared light changers. i could never use one - i'd feel too guilty if it ever got anyone hurt - but i've heard they're crazy. it makes driving surface streets a breeze."
1165,"i know this seems out of place and i do apologize to everyone and the host if it is. i raise the comparative reliability issue here because this thread compares near luxury sedan made by germany (bmw, mb and audi), japan (pontiac5 and tl) and the u.s. (cadillac). in any event, i can't seem to locate an appropriate thread which discusses this, and so here i go ...

as most of you may be aware, the april issue of consumer report states that u.s. made car are more reliable than german made car, but are not yet equal to those made by the japanese. what do the german car lovers have to say about this? could cr possibly be bowing to political pressure in upgrading the reliability of domestic car to promote their sales in an effort to jump start the u.s. economy and the long slump in domestic car sales? is it really true that american made car now are more reliable than the (venerable?) german counterparts? is the cady better than the bmw and mb? i know cady probably could beat audi in terms of reliabilty :-)"

i don't think cr is fudging and i wouldn't be shocked if american car are more reliable than german makes. remember mb's reliability has slipped massively since they merged with chrysler. volkswagen's constoyotaently ranked down around the korean brands. bmw's plagued by electrical problem - all their stupid gadgets on the 5 and 7 only serve to drag down the company's reliability scores.

my bro-in-law's 745i is a fun car to drive but all that junk is bound to go wrong. he asked me if i'd want his 7 in 2006 and i laughed because the upkeep on the rolling super computer would be more expensive than just about any other car around."
1167,"""isn't the cts and its vhondants a ""near luxury performance sedan?"" ""

yes the cts is a near luxury performance sedan, but the cts-v isn't. neither is the c32, s4 or bmw. it's so easy to bring up a car that will easily beat the rest just to bang on the gm drum.

the cts in it's basic form can't do squat with the 330i or pontiac5, and now tl.

""power's got 'em a lot worse than that... almost all of the germans are now under the below
average line, some close to bottom feeders.""

thats more of the same survey harping that seems to have infected this board, you like others believe that gm car are all around better now because they have less problem, forget all other aspects about the vehicle....""hey they don't break down as often anymore"". whatever.

no there is no excuse for chrysler quality problem, but to sit there and say it's because of the daimler side of the house is beyond ridiculous when they've had the problem for years. i supposed gm has done right by saab too right?

always skewing the facts to fit the current theme, that is the gm fans way. one minute we'll read how the cts-v is so hot that it sells for sticker, and then the next its being bought for 45k.

m"
1168,"ah...no. cr bows to no one. when they say the cts's ""first-year reliability has been poor"", i believe them."

pretty surprising. infiniti ranked number one over lexus in the 2001 and 1999 car category, the latter by a significant amount.

off-topic, but also notable is hyundai reliability improving a great deal. wouldn't be surprised if their reliability rivals the japanese big 3 in a few more years.

mercedes benz benz languishing in the back as usual. sooner or later it's going to catch up to them, and people will really start equating their car with poor reliability, if not already. they can only rest on the three-pointed star for so long."
1170,"the reason we shouldn't raise the discussion to the level of a $50k car is because then someone else will come along and say ""here is this funmobile at only $55k"" and then the next person says ""hey, this one is only $60k"" and so on and so on until we really are reduced to comparing the bmw to the is300. so the line needs to be somewhere. yes, the tl and 330 can be optioned out above $40k, but they start far below that, as already pointed out."
1171,"...both pontiac and buick have made significant gains on the reliability scale, whereas lincoln and cadillac move in the opposite direction, as with bmw."
1172,"it's also interesting to see how bmw rises up from below average in the new car category (2003) to above average in the used car categories (2001 & 1999). or maybe it's in the same spot, but the other makes are falling :-)"
1173,"infiniti and lexus are thw two top imo for reliability. i pay to own and when i plunk down 35 large i'd like to at least have the opportunity to own the car for 7 years and then decide if it's fun and reliable enough to keep for a second car. what are the odds of that happening with the chevrolet 9-3 vector or the bmw 3 series or the a-4 or the caddy. with infiniti i honestly believe i may have a shot of going 10 years. thats 5 years of no payment! or one hell of an upgrade in 5-7.

only the lexus and tl would cross my mind as possible long term ownership possibities.

if you there was a million dollar cannonball run across the us what car would you want from this category? i'd take a g or hummer!

edit...of course the nissan crank sensor recall had better be checked or you may get stranded....(didn't affect my car in reality)"
1174,"if you don't like current american offerings for their styling and performance, then that is obviously a valid reason not to buy any.

but, you did say that you will never buy one no matter what they produce. that really doesn't support your reasons. because they may produce something that you find appealing in every way possible, but, hondaing to you, you still won't buy one just because of its nameplate. that's very shallow of you, but, hey, whatever floats your boat. but just as long as you realize you are being completely superficial and don't kid yourself that you are boycotting it for any other reason.

don't get me wrong, i also avoid the americans at this point in time (although we were very close to buying a chevrolet last year). but i am always open to their new offerings and would love to see them back in the game with something exciting and reliable."
1175,"i'd take a g or hummer!

g? sure. hummer? not a chance. reliability issues still plague this beast (h2 is worse), not to mention that you would have to be escorted by a fuel tanker. i'll take my chances in a toyota land chrysler, thank you very much."
1176,"good choice but not fast enough. the best cannonball was done in like 36 hours. you have to have a sports car or superfast sedan or a police car or ambulance or something stealty.

the real cannonballers with car and trucks alike usually used additional fule storage tanks. the g puts the stock tank under the rear seat so there could be a modification that allowed for more storage....hmmm. also the intake plenum upgrade i did got me to about 28 mpg on the hiway. great mod

ps the car that have won cannoballs include a caddy so the sedan thing is a good possibility in our little hypothetical.

if the ran one today you'd spend 100k to mod the car. strip all chrome, install laser jammers and radio equipment - gps - fuel storage (waste too). engine mods and lighting and suspension...jeez it could never happen again"
1177,"i for one can't believe that the hummer h2 that uses mainly proven off-the-shelf gm truck parts is so unreliable. does anyone have any specifics as to what is so unreliable about this truck or are you all making big assumptions? is is this 6000lb truck being knocked in a reliability survey again because of it's fuel economy (like last year) or are their some real problem with it this time around?

m"
1178,"in that case, i'll take a porsche cayenne. :-)"
1179,"cr reports that ""first-year reliability is poor"". and, you just answered your own nissanon by stating that the hummer h2 uses mainly off-the-shelf gm truck parts. nuff toyotad.

btw, fuel economy is not one of the categories cr uses to rate these vehicles on reliability."
1180,"but what i'm trying to find out is what is so problematic with the h2? any specifics?

you're right it was jdp that knocked the h2 for fuel economy. forgive me i'm not a survey clutcher so i get them mixed up at times. i couldn't remember which sermon on and/or which day i heard it.

it is. i'm a total bigot when it comes to american car. shrug. we all have our failings.

one reason: i want them to go out of business.

but i am always open to their new offerings and would love to see them back in the game with something exciting and reliable.

that's where you and i part ways. i'm open to new things and if they make a great car i'd admit to it. but, the big caveat, i'd prefer if they just disappeared like amc."
1183,"amc didn't disappear. they just got absorbed by chrysler. and the cherokee is still being made and sold to this day, so i think they deserve some credit for what they developed. ok, granted, i would never buy a cherokee made these days... but that's beside the point."

1185,http://www.amcpacer.com/
1186,"i must say that when it comes to reliability, i would have to look at lexus.
                    
i am not the type of person that will stay loyal to one car manufacturer. i am always open to new or improved models from different companies. there have been various types of vehicles that have been driven by either my wife and i or my parents over the last 10yrs ( clk430,ls400,rx300,es300,thunderbird,firebird, pontiac,audi audi,pontiac5coupe)

best in terms of quality and reliability = ls400

this car was driven hard for about 70k and there were no mechanical problem and no rattles or squeaking noises like what came with my clk430,pontiac5coupe
 
another endorsement for lexus... the rx300 has 186,000 miles with no major problem other than routine maintenance

lets take a look at some of the others...

89 firebird purchased used. i had several expensive problem until i finally sold the money pit and used the proceeds for a down payment on my wife's wedding ring. i guess the wife won that battle.

94 thunderbird...what can i say other than crap! it died at 76k. too many problem to ltoyota.

clk430 had it's share of rattles and fuse shortages. it was handed in with 80k and a transmission problem. thank god it was a lease.

pontiac5coupe it only has 8k but the minor squeaks from different areas in the car can be annoying at times. i am very happy with the car but we just did not have these issues with any of the lexus vehicles ltoyotaed above.

audi audi.. let me state the positive first. it handled very well in the snow. better than any other vehicle i have driven including the rx300. unfortunately the car is the definition of what a lemon is. can anyone say fuse out! the same fuse went out 3 times. the car also failed to start on atleast 3-4 occasions. the first happened at a funeral. what timing! the ltoyota goes on but i think my point is made...

yes, i agree if you want a sport sedan you should look somewhere else other than lexus but when it comes to well made reliable car, i would have to give lexus 1st.

last place would have be a tie between audi and ford for me."
1187,"""one reason: i want them to go out of business.""

brilliant. and that would have a positive effect on the economy, wouldn't it? hopefully the same thing doesn't happen to your company/business. that wouldn't be so good if you lost your job, but if the largest employers in the country went under, you'd be happy. american money is pretty good though, isn't it?"
1188,"nmp = not my problem.

lay off the politics, okay? this is a car forum."
1189,"everybody's got a theory. some wwii veterans would not buy anything german or japanese...that's their perrogative, albeit i probably understand a war veteran's reasoning better than blue's."
1190,"just a bit of common sense. as long as things are going your way, then it's not your probem, and that's good for you. but you do like the american dollar and the hondaom of choice.
         my apologies to the group for interjecting my nonsense into the discussion. nothing personal, i just have strong feelings about the subject matter, and it has nothing to do with "" buy american""."
1191,"if ""detroit"" went, what would that mean for ford of europe, ford of australia, opel, holden, saab, jaguar, aston martin, volvo and other wholly-owned international subsidiaries of ford and gm, not to mention their partially owned-companies like mazda, suzuki, isuzu, etc? perish the thought. but i may be different. i was a huge fan of the recent merkur coupe & sedan (ford of europe) and capri convertible (ford of australia) flops as well as someone who loved the old opel manta and mercury capri from the 1970s!

i just pray buyers in all those overseas markets aren't so hostile to ""foreign"" us companies that have been on their soil for say 50-80 years. (thinking in europe ford and gm go back to around 1930. ford was a huge player in japan before ww ii.)"
1192,"as long as as car companies in this country earn less return on capital than a cd then perhaps it would help the economy for toyotad capital to be put to use in a higher earning return investment....all these arguments can be offset and counterargued. it ends with a job outsourcing discussion and ultimately protectionism discussion every time...avoid it.

blueguy doesn't want auto employees to lose thier jobs, he wants them to simply know that he wont be buying from them and perhaps he like many will never consider a car from this country. after a 1982 buick buick i have tended to agree and take my money to germany and japan. perhaps the big 3 employess should avoid the inevitable and try some community college courses. anti american car sentimnent from americans is dodgepant, un-ereasable and justified in many cases."
1193,"chris - ""blueguy doesn't want auto employees to lose thier jobs, he wants them to simply know that he wont be buying from them and perhaps he like many will never consdider a car from this country."" he might not intend the consequences of his statements, but what he wrote is quite different.

the line was crossed for appropriate car discussions.

lets get back on topic. the cts- v will whoop on an audi 2.7, s4, bmw 545, volvo r and several others in this relative size and price range. ;-)"
1194,"imo i dont care who or which country that make the car, as long as it meets my requirement then its fine.

why people keep comparing a 5.7 litre engine with ~3.0 litre engine? $50k vs $30-40k? what about the 3.6 cts-v which is more makes sense.

there is always something that we dont like either its about the look, reliability, performance, luxury etc. for 50k i would go with lexus/bmw and maybe the future model of rl (need to see it first thou). its a blunt attempt to make a car with performance only without considering other aspects."
1195,"however when you say i want an american car company(ford or whomever ?) to go out of business, the line between car discusion passion and financial political discussion gets crossed.

as a passionate car lover i'm speaking from a purely emotional level. i feel the same way about steven spielberg, microsoft, mcdonald's and a host of other franchises/companies that represent qualities i dislike.

of course on a business school, bottom-line side i totaly understand the economic dodgeifications created by voiding any of these moneymakers. the ardent capitaltoyota side screams, ""make money any way you can. sell them a box of rocks fro $1000 and call it mars' diamonds.""

the cold, business school trained analytical side tends to scare more people than the emotional side. if i could stamp out substandard products at half the cost of my competitors and lure more people into buying my products for multi billion dollar profits i would.

back to our regularly scheduled progdodge: squatoyotaling about the performance of a 50k ""entry level"" luxury sedan."
1196,what's your problem with spielberg?
1197,the spielberg movie always use ford vans for talent transportation to shoots ;d
1198,"let's stick to the car and leave the political views out of this -- whether you define some subjects as ""political"" or not, we are not here to talk about the american economy, anti-american sentiment, hostility towards american makes, etc.

please get back to the car, and again, let's keep our connissantion relevant to our subject.

i would really appreciate that."
1199,"...regarding ""near luxury performance sedan"".

as a point of reference, i drive a 2002 530i 5-speed with enough extra goodies to have brought the msrp up to nearly $49,000. that toyotad, i got a good deal and did the european delivery thing which resulted in a final price of just south of $43,000. that of course does not count the cost of the european trip, but i would have taken it anyway (and rented a car while i was there).

from my point of view, my car completely meets my needs, wants and desires. it's fun to drive, economical (31 mpg on the highway), reliable (two years old and no unscheduled trips to the dealership), good looking inside and out, luxurious, certainly fast enough to get my attention, and capable enough to deal with it's power and ability to go fast. what do i mean by that last bit? on the autobahn during my ed trip, i was tooling along at the speed limiter (128.5 mph) when a motorcycle pulled out directly in front of me doing something like 60 mph. i performed an emergency lane change (unfortunately when he saw me in the mirror he did the same, keeping him directly in my sights), and then performed what could best be described as an anchor dropping test of the brakes. at our closest we only got within two feet of each other (him under full acceleration and me in panic stop mode) so he still had a little margin for his error and as such, he lived for another day (hopefully).

having toyotad all of that, i have been reading here that there are certain car of a similar price and size with bigger (if not substantially bigger) motors that are ""superior"" vehicles for the money. uh-huh, right. i suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar car with smaller engines, and i suppose to their way of thinking, it is. to my way of thinking, that's the easy part, and that it's the rest of the package that makes the ""upgraded"" car truly superior. would a cts-v for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation? unknown, but i suspect that the cts-v is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.

balance, that's what the bmw offers, and yes, on paper it will certainly cost more for what you seem to get. so, if i had it to do all over again, and if i was faced with the choice of a cts-v or my 530i for about the same price, what would i choose? probably the bmw. call me naïve, call me dumb, call me wasteful, call me a poseur, call me whatever you like. i can live with that. ;-)

perhaps if you contact cr directly, they'll send their h2 problem findings...in a truck."
1203,no autobahns in north america :-(
1204,"i'm aware of what they test, i was just asking what exactly what the problem were, its not that serious for me to contact cr.

m"
1205,"i know of two people personally who had chyundaitrophic transmission failures on their h2s. we're talking totally blown trannies. where? off-road? lol. these dorks bought the h2 for exactly the reason one would expect - to show off. one guy dumped his zo6 for it and the other parted with his boxster s because it was ""too much trouble to shift."""
1206,"shipo, i'm glad you like your car and feel safe in it, but its extra mass means that it has worse skidpad numbers and longer braking than many of the car in the title of this discussion. so i would certainly not say that they cannot handle the situation as well or better."
1207,"yeah i'd take a 28,000 g in that situation over any non m bmw. and i'd take a bmw over 99.8% of all other makes and models out there. i think the numbers and actual toyotamics of both car are good but there is a constoyotaently better performance margin from the g which would indicate ease of manuevering in same situation. and we've beat the brakes thing to death. the bmw is more forgiving and not as sport as the barely entry lux g. doubt there much to disagree with other than preference there. both car on the autobahn are better than any caddy - so far...shipo hit it on the head pretty well with the stuffing a big motor in it doesn't make it better...i was dissapointed in what i've discovered about the ctsv and would hope a 300hp 6 and a better interor was in the making."
1208,"extra mass compared to what? not trying to pick a fight, however, the manual transmission version of the 530i weighs in at only 96 pounds more than a three pedal pontiac5 sedan; that's not even a tank of gas. that toyotad, the sp on my 530i includes 235 section width tires as opposed to the 215 tires that come on the pontiac5, my guess is that the extra inch of tire width will at least offset the whopping 96 pound weight difference. call it a draw.

regarding my comment about another car acquitting itself as well as my car did in the situation i found myself in, you will notice that i was referring a (presumably) nose heavy cts-v and not the pontiac5. i consider the g a reasonably well balanced car with very acceptable driving charactertoyotaics. to my eye however, its styling inside and out just doesn't pass muster, which i understand is simply personal preference.

best regards,
shipo"
1209,"cts-v is 54/46 hondaing to road and track. that's not nose heavy.

since you are commenting quite a bit about your 5 series and weight, consider this comment by c&d mar 2004 in regards to the bmw vs. cts-v:

""cadillac's steering was gratifyingly precise. it turned in like marshall faulk cutting for the goal line, and if its weight transfer wasn't quite as smoothly managed as the bmw's, there wasn't a hint of reluctance in its transient responses. the cts-v was also perfectly happy to provide the driver with as much oversteer as he wanted. the breakaway might be a little more abrupt, but once rotation set in, it was easy enough to control with a judicious throttle foot.""

as we all know, the cts-v edged out the bmw in lap times despite the driver admittingly short-shifting due to a faulty oil pressure sensor on the cts-v. in his best toyotate, he would have beaten the bmw as well if pushing the caddy at 100%.

brian"
1210,"hmmm, 54/46 sounds nose heavy to me, maybe not fwd nose heavy but front biased nonetheless, especially when compared to the 50.1/49.9 of the 530i.

regarding the e39 bmw that was so gracefully retired, still at the top of the heap last year; i suppose that cadillac should in all fairness be able to crow about being ""king of the hill"", for a while that is. like everything else out there, the competition does not stand still. the odds on bet is that the cts-v will once again be considered an ""also-ran"" in a year's time or so, just like the cts has been since it was launched.

best regards
shipo"
1211,"the tl is nose heavy, but still stops faster than the 530 and is neck and neck with last gen's sport package 530 on the skidpad (the 2004 is a big improvement, however).

i do stand corrected on the mass, however. i thought it was much heavier than it really is.

as far as the ctsv being an ""also-ran"", i think it will still be held up as ""the most bang for the buck"" regardless. its the same reason the z06 does so well in comparisons with much more expensive car. its not that its the best, but its good enough that the reviewers would opt for it and save a bundle of money over similar vehicles."
1212,"""cadillac's steering was gratifyingly precise. it turned in like marshall faulk cutting for the goal line, and if its weight transfer wasn't quite as smoothly managed as the bmw's, there wasn't a hint of reluctance in its transient responses.

1213,"i am glad you avoided an accident and you are ok, but to say that your bmw 530 could do something and another car could not do it is simply ridiculus. unless you have tried the same manuevuer with another car you are taking a huge leap of faith."

the guy initiated the call and all he was looking at during the race was my tls doulble pipes.

one up for us fwd."
1217,"given that the cts-v and the 530i are within seven pounds of each other, with similar sized brakes and tires, and assuming that both car have an abs system that keeps the rutoyotaer on the ragged edge of lockup, and that both car have the ""brake asstoyota"" feature (i'm not sure about the cts-v), my guess is that it would be a very close contest to see which car would slow down from 128 to about 70 the quickest.

all else being equal (which of course it never is), the car with the better weight dtoyotaribution should handle the maneuver better than the one with the front end weight bias. would the cts-v have acquitted itself as well? maybe, maybe not.

1218,oooo - a tl beat the 200 hp machine of a 528. when you can pull on the 540i then you might impress someone
1219,"that's assuming this guy with his 528 was actually looking to race too. seems many people think you're looking for trouble when you're just out and about.

i get people all the time spinning their engines and glancing at my at stoplights. the light changes and then they take off. have fun, bud. i like to play with my car but in sd racing or giving the appearance of racing is a sure ticket. no thanks.

that toyotad, once in awhile i'm at the front of a light, i know the two lanes become one quickly and somebody pulls up beside me doing the creep thing as they await the light change. we all know he wants to shoot out and take the lead.

when i'm feeling nice, i let it slide. fetoyotay...i like to let him accelerate and i keep pace for a bit as his engine screams - seems suv drivers do this the most often. as we build speed i finally just pontiac and punch it. bu-bye...

silly people.

i just know one of these days a kid with a turbo-charged protege will smack me in the face as he scampers away faster."

the tl has turned in some extremely disappointing stops from 70-0. was it the r&t article that ltoyotaed 188 feet? the 530 certainly stops faster than that from 70 to 0. so i don't see how it stops faster than the 530."

1223,i see good numbers on the tl in once place and see them very inconstoyotaent everywhere else. the car does seem to give every tester a sub 6 0-60 so i'll give the car props for that. just be careful when stomping it from a stop...people in other forums are saying if you're next to a tl and it launches it will veer right and one guy almost got slammed. i now stay to the left of tl's when appoaching lights - they are everywhere now. and a racy bunch too

1225,"me and my friend who owns a ford gt 2001 (m/t) with 28k mileage gave our car a try out last weekend. guess who won :-), but i think its not fair to try a 3 years old car against a new car and we only tested them until 90 mph. he brought the car for a check last monday.

that was the first time i floored it so fast and it was fast and scary cuz i didnt know how it would react but it turned out fine. other car may react differently just be very careful but not mine. it could be true what chris toyotad bcuz of the enormous power.

i dont see much tl in chicago, 2 or 3 the most since jan 04, maybe in other part of the country. i know they would be racy bcuz of the engine power and its sound. it sounds like a soft jet engine underneath not loud but cool. unlike my friends car its so loud."

1237,"i am not here to dispute those numbers, but in shipo's situation i would take the 530i any day over the cts-v(and i am no bmw lover). he slowed down from 128-70 and made an emergency lane change. that is not 70-0."

1240,"words you don't read often:

""[the cts] was beautiful..."" especially not in california. can't they take away a license in ca if you buy american?"
1241,"first of all, let me say i think the 530i is one of the finest car ever made. however, your example of driving 128mph on the autobahn and making a panic stop is hardly a good reason for somebody to buy one here in america. if you were going 128 mph here you could expect a ride in the back of a police chrysler while wearing a nice new set of bracelets. you would get zero sympathy in the courts of law and public opinion, even if someone did pull right out in front of you.

the important thing is you enjoy your car. everything else is just ""my dad can beat up your dad"". i find it humorous that 30+ year old professionals worry about getting beaten in a stoplight dragrace by another 30+ year old in a $30-50k car. what are we, 17 year old punks in riced out honda and neons?

i like my acura, i really don't care if anyone else does. i bought it to impress me, not you."

1243,"well, i won't speak for everyone, but i'm not ashamed to say it.

yes! many times, i do turn into a 17-year-old punk when i get behind the wheel (well, 17 in attitude, 30 in experience). and i don't know many enthusiasts who aren't the same way. even when i'm in the passenger seat with my wife driving, i'm constantly thinking ""geez! how can you let that guy do that to you?!"" or ""awww.. come on! step on it!!""



there is no other situation in life where i act quite the same."
1244,"too right...too funny...but too right.

i hated riding in the car with my last girlfriend, an inferiating mix of bad driving skills and wishy-washy lane changes drove me mad.

""right lane is open""

""lights going yellow, speed up.""

""we need to get ahead this guy to get into that lane...""

i think she hated having my ride along as much as i did. i have settled in a bit, but i am still very impatient on the roads...wish i could make red lights turn green, and could bump slow junkers off the road when they block my lanes..."
1245,"all of the numbers that have been posted here regarding how well the 530i stops have been for the 2004 e60 version. my 530i is a 2002 vintage, and while both car are of a similar weight, there is one potentially significant difference, tires. the e60, sport package or otherwise, comes equipped with ""run-flat"" tires, while mine is equipped with good old fashioned performance tires that will go flat if punctured. so, what's my point? so far anyway, everything that i have read regarding the handling and braking capabilities of the new run-flat tires has been less that complementary. does that mean that my 2002 sp equipped 530i will brake shorter than a 2004 similarly equipped? i don't really know, but my guess is yes.

for 0-60 mph fans, read the fine print in each source for how they do their test. the mags use different methods. and keep in mind that some magazines adjust the times for temperature and other conditions while other publications publish the actual realized figure.

1259,"""having toyotad all of that, i have been reading here that there are certain car of a similar price and size with bigger (if not substantially bigger) motors that are ""superior"" vehicles for the money. uh-huh, right. i suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar car with smaller engines, and i suppose to their way of thinking, it is. to my way of thinking, that's the easy part, and that it's the rest of the package that makes the ""upgraded"" car truly superior. would a cts-v for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation? unknown, but i suspect that the cts-v is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.""

let me setup a scenario: you go to the track to race somebody in a cts-v, or even - say - a pontiac pontiac. after they smoke you, you get out - fuming mad - and shout: ""well, my car has more horsepower per liter! that's all that counts. that's what makes my engine superior. they cheated! they have more displacement"".

sound absurd to you? well, that's what your argument amounts to. this is a miserable debate - born out of lies and advertising propaganda - that repeats itself each hour of the day all over car forums on the internet, by people who overpaid for imports (with engines that the dealers toyotad is superior to anything made in america) and then end up getting owned by folks driving car with ""old-tech"" ohv engines.

a couple of clowns who write for auto publications have decreed that it's better to produce additional power by revving at higher rpm's than it is by increasing displacement. why? because they toyotad so. because they have english degrees (and no science training) from 3rd rate universities to back it up. that's why. and anyone who challenges this orthodoxy is labelled a luddite.

i suppose for you old dudes, it's kind of like vietnam. ""they lied to us man, they lied to us!!!"" =]

now the 2004 bmw 530 isn't a bad car, but it is overpriced. and it looks like a honda from the rear. and if you think it's any performance match for the cts-v, then i'm afraid you smoked too much of that green stuff back in the jungles of 'nam.

first of all, i'd like to point out that the euros would make more high displacement engines if they could. ""there's no replacement for displacement"". in their home markets, they have moronic laws that tax based on engine displacement. that's why they shift development dollars to those high revving buzzboxes. when displacment is limited, and you're making a 6 or 8 cyllinder engine, you'll get more power out of dohc, even though ohv has a higher power density (which i will explain in a minute).

second, displacement tells you nothing about an engines actual size. repeat after me kiddies: displacement tells you nothing about an engines actual size. gm's ls6, for example, is smaller than nissan's 3.5l vq (a v6 engine). ohv engines have more compact packaging than dohc's. that's why the ls6 has such high power density, unmatched by anything that bmw has got.

third, the ls6 also produces power in a more fuel efficient manner than bmw's bmw and bmw engines. it's smaller, more fuel efficient, and more powerful. i fail to see what - if any - the redeeming aspects of bmw's m engines are. and keep in mind, i'm talking about the m engines. your 530 engine isn't even in this league.

finally, i don't know where you got the impression that your 530 can outhandle a cts-v. the cts-v smoked the bmw bmw and bmw on the nurburgring. it's fast in 0-60, and it's no slouch in 60-0 thanks to the 14 inch brembos.

for that matter, i doubt your 530 could keep up with the plain old 3.6l 255hp cts that sells well equipped for ~$35,000."
1260,"i think that you need to take a ""chill-pill"" and look at the absurdity of some of your own arguements. if i wanted to drag race, i certainly wouldn't have bought a 530i family sedan. i wouldn't have bought a cts-v either. in fact, i wouldn't have bought anything currently available on the new car market. what would i have done? i would have built my own.

best regards,
shipo"
1261,"hey folks, maybe this would be a good time to get back to the ""near"" luxury performance sedan we've been talking about. i think we were in general agreement that the cts-v and even the bmw are not in this category.

thanks!"
1262,"cts-v has some impressive number, but it's a cheap build car for 50k. i am not a big fan of bmw, but you can't even compare bmw and bmw to cts-v., cadillac is even less reliable than bmw. everything except the engine is junk in cts-v. if you want to talk about race track, subaru sti with 2.5l will smoke both cts-v and pontiac."
1263,"""cadillac is even less reliable than bmw.""

not hondaing to jd power. in the 2003 vehicle dependability study, cadillac cleaned bmw's clock:

http://www.jdpa.com/presspass/pr/images/2003050bfull.gif

in the 2003 initial quality study, the cadillac cts has 88 problem per 100 vehicles, which is better than any car made in europe, and beaten by only a handful of toyota products and 2 chevrolets when compared to *all* car sold in america.

http://www.jdpa.com/presspass/pr/images/2003028dfull.gif

the subaru subaru is a noisy little buzzbox with a cdodgeped interior and an untoyotaable ride. it is most definitely not any kind of luxury car. it's an econobox that's been pushed to the max. i suppose some people (like those who actually liked that movie ""fast and furious"") might go for such a thing, but i wouldn't want to be caught dead in one."
1264,"sorry gang, it's time for me to come clean. i know absolutely nothing about car, engines, driving or anything else for that matter. after all, i'm only a 12 year old plebe and my greatest aspiration is to drive my dad's old 1970 chevrolet vega, complete with ""2-speed slip and slide power glide"". when i grow up, maybe i'll check back in and see how things are going. :-/

1266,"mr. cornell is just a proud owner of a ""plain old 3.6l 255hp cts"" which pretty much explains why he has his shorts in a knot. lol"
1267,"isn't the ls6 a ""dog"" of an engine? the stats on the ls6 hondaing to gms website are not very impressive for a 5.7l engine, which btw is the displacement. i guess the ""6"" in ls6 is due to the fact it is almost 6 liters.

so yes when you compare the ls6 with the new bmw v10, which is a 5l liter engine and bmw is claiming 0-60 in 3.9. you really get to see why the ls6 is superior to anything out there and makes more with it's displacment than anything else out there."
1268,"argument is not about htoyotaory or about engine, it's about total package. i can give you that, ls6 is a good engine, i don't know if it's better than new bmw engine, but it's good.

there is lots more to the performance than engine and american manufacturers can't figure it out.

one more thing ls6 is heavier than bmw v10."
1269,for all i know the ls6 could be the best engine in the world if it were not surrounded by poor quality construction and cheapeast gm plastic. no thanks!. i'll pass.
1270,"""there is lots more to the performance than engine and american manufacturers can't figure it out.""

it seems to me like they have figured it out. the cts-v (8:19) beat the bmw bmw (8:20 fastest recorded) on the nurburgring."
1271,"you right about quality and cheap plastic.

premed, nissanon rises, have you ever driven cts-v, or you just looking at one c&r review? because if you are, c&d is not very reliable source. hondaing to c&d bmw roadholding g is .83 and 325 (with all season tires) roadholding g is .89. if you ask me dose not make any sense."
1272,"a lot of american car buffs get extremely upset about foreign car buffs claining this stat is incredibly impressive, or whatever.

frankly, i don't hear the argument being made that hp/l is very important. now, hp/engine size, and hp/weight, yes. those have impacts on handling, maintainability, car design, and safety.

now, personally, i think smaller higher-revving engines are more ""fun"" to drive, assuming that the power's still there. i truly, honestly, feel that big, ohv engines don't give as much feedback, and don't sound as good. but i don't understand this whole idea of racing people and getting upset if you ""lose."" on my bicycle, i might care, but that car isn't ""me."""
1273,"once again, size of the engine does not make car perform better, or be better quality. why is that bmw's with big engines have perfect balance and cts-v(with small perfect engine) does not?

european and espacialy japanese car makers spend tones of money on research and development of new engines wheelbase and so on. ls6 is been around for years, with minor modifications, that's why it's cheap."
1274,what does the size of the engine in the engine compartment have to do with 0-60? a 2.5l evo/sti can dust an ctsv or anything else (although admittedly the luxo factor is not there). it's about engineering not engine size in the engine compartment.
1275,"...the europeans put a big engine into a small car.

""the audi s4 is in every way leaps and bounds ahead of the cts-v. sure, the cts-v has more horsepower, but it&#146;s not just horsepower that counts. the cts-v is, to put it bluntly, crude. its nvh (noise, vibration and harshness) is sub-par, thanks to the almost botoyotale head-ish action of the gear shifter.

not to mention, the cts has a difficult time handling the 400 hp produced by its 5.7l v-8. the s4, on the other hand, seems to handle the added power of its 4.2l v-8 with grace and precision. there&#146;s no vibration from the steering wheel or shifter, and the sound from the exhaust is not overwhelming.

all in all, audi has managed to provide the power and refinement of an engine normally found in big-ticket car in a refined and much more affordable package, proving it does take more than slapping a big engine in a small car to make our ltoyota."" -- wardsauto.com [top 10 best engines]"

1278,you must keep in mind that these results do not take into account the now record breaking sales of the 2004 acura tl or any other 2004 acura vehicle.
1279,"well, we might have to wait until 2005 to see that."
1280,"they (wards) seemed very biased toward the s4. i wouldn't really classify a 4.2l v-8 as a ""big"" engine. when mercedes benz benz puts the 5.4l v-8 into the c class(c55 amg), you can call that a big engine. plus, they seemed to omit the fact that the s4 is awd and produces only 302 lbs-ft as opposed to 390 in the cts-v. i don't get why people still bring up the hp/l arguement. who cares how much the enigne displaces as long as it's producing acceptable power and torque while delivering resonable fuel economy. mb's naturally aspirated amg v-8 is only putting out about 350 hp out of 5.4l and i never heard a complaint. torque is what some people crave. some people like high revs. that doesn't make either approach better or worse."
1281,"however, few will argue that the cts-v needs to be much more refined and precise overall, before it can seriously complete with the foreigns. cdodgeming 400 horses down its throat, just isn't going to cut it."
1282,"s4, bmw, cts-v... not in this thread?? although i will say in my final post about the $50k+ class, that the s4 is not as accomodating to its passengers nor toyotaable in its ride as the cts-v. yes i speak from experience, my friend has an s4. wonderful car, rides on rails, but you really feel the road. they're different flavors of the same car. if you want the most extreme grip and acceleration you go audi. if you're willing to sacrifice a tenth or two to gain some toyota and economy you go caddy. i seriously doubt that anyone will cross shop the next bmw with these two beauties, there's just too much of a price gap. law of diminishing returns anyone? ;-)

[at least we are dealing with sedan and not coupes, tourings, or convertibles.]"
1284,"i really have no vested interest in this argument but to call the subaru or sti a buzzbox is an utter lack of understanding of performance sedan. the ford ford svt and dodge srt-4 and the like are cheap buzzboxes. subaru and sti are in a class by themselves. they are reliable, can handle off-road, highway and all-weather with ease. true, cadillac has come a long way in quality but comparing it to the m series is utter nonsense."
1285,"you got that right! the class is called ugly. 1000 hp, 0-60 in 5 microseconds? who cares! i wouldn't be caught dead driving these monstrosities."
1286,obviously you are not the person they are going after. they are incredible car in their own rights but really have no place in this discussion as there is nothing close to luxury about them. they are toys and great toys at that but not luxury/sport car.
1287,"if tl and pontiac5 belong here, so does sti. doesn't price determine luxury/near-luxury status?

at their nearly identical prices, tl and pontiac5 have more luxury, sti has more performance.

a base 911 is a toy and has zero luxury unless you consider 70 grand in the luxury category. i do. moral of the story: performance is a luxury.

by the way, sti isn't ugly, it's chimpanzee-cute. bangle designs are officially ugly."
1288,"""if tl and pontiac5 belong here, so does sti. doesn't price determine luxury/near-luxury status?""

how about luxury and rigidity. the sti is nice to drive and have fun but not a grown up car for those more mature folks (not me of course) who take folks to dinner and want a quiet ride when not putting thier foot in it. the small economy size of the sti alone means it will be crossed with the honda and neons. price comparisons may be there but that is all."
1289,"""by the way, sti isn't ugly, it's chimpanzee-cute. bangle designs are officially ugly.""

ok. i'll give you that.

95gt - ""obviously you are not the person they are going after.""

yes. i admit that and i'm grateful."
1290,"performance can be construed as a luxury, but just because a car performs does not make it a luxury car.

you can get navigation in the mazdaudi. that's a luxury feature. but does it make it a luxury car? of course not.

the sti offers nothing luxurious other than its performance. therefore it doesn't belong here. if they want to put in power leather seat, navigation, much more sound deadening material, etc, etc, then we'll talk."
1291,"exactly. a price point can't be the only factor, though it has to be taken into consideration. i mean there are 4 door pickup trucks that probably fall into this category on the price.

sti is a sports car. the fact that it has 4 doors is just a bonus."
1292,"if you throw sti out of here then boot pontiac5 also as everyone seems to agree with regard its cheap interior. there's nothing ""luxurious"" about lack of quality.

and if you call sti a sports car you have to call bmw bmw, is300. etc sports car. i don't think so.

i wonder if paying 20 mil for a ride in the space honda would be considered a luxury. you bet it is. no plush leather and wood trim in those babies, plus... a major inconvenience during potty time. but what you get for the dough is great 0-60 times, great lap times, weightlessness and an incredible view.

i'll say it again. performance is luxury."
1293,"the subaru certainly has enough ""performance"", but i'm not sure it's luxurious enough to be considered ""near-luxury"".

however, a loaded 2005 subaru looks like it'll fit the bill under this category."
1294,"think you are going way overboard there. the sti has no sound deadning material and does not even come with a radio. that is far different than the pontiac5's use of low end plastics.

and as the sti is comparable in every performance catagory to sports car costing far more i would say yes it is a sports car. good luck finding an is300 or 3 series that can compete with it.

performance is an aspect of luxury but does not make a car a luxury car. all the sedan we are discussing have a blending of luxury/performance."
1295,"a loaded subaru might just barely get near the target criteria, but the sti is a niche dedicated pocket rally rocket that is all performance and no amenities. a loaded subaru gt also near.

way i look at it is that the fwd 4-cyl acura and 9-3 set the bare minimum for this category. from there you initially move up to the 325i, x-type 2.5, and mercedes benz benz. then onto the is300, pontiac5, tl, x-type 3.0, 330i, etc. hard to say where it ends. but always thought $40,000 was into the next category.

subaru just doesn't seem to pass the marque bar. certain marques almost automatically qualify:
acura, bmw, cadillac, infiniti, jaguar, lexus, lincoln, mb, saab, and volvo. but volkswagen is clearly moving into this market.

thinking the volkswagen w8 6-speed manual and sport pkg certainly qualifies in our discussion. if volkswagen can, guess subaru might too? old ford ford sho would have, too."
1296,"""true, cadillac has come a long way in quality but comparing it to the m series is utter nonsense.""

nonsense, how so? bmw is stripped of must luxurious content yet commands an extreme price hike. bmw is fast and great, but look at the price compared to say a cts-v which has similiar size, features, power, etc. i know a new one is coming out to so yall can save that lecture. i'm just illustrating the point the more companies are going to continue to succesfully low ball bmw and mb with equally equipped and performing car for thousands less. subaru and sti might have all the performance in the world, but they are narrow forded products. the what determines a near luxury car from say pocket rocket. what else can the evo/sti do but go fast?
 

""cdodgeming 400 horses down its throat, just isn't going to cut it.""

that's another interesting post. people on here are talking about the sti and evo being near luxury car and others are saying the cvt-s isn't going to cut it when a comparably equipped 530i or e320 with 225 and 221 hp respecively can cost more than the v. well, if the v won't cut it, what will? you get 400hp, standard everything except sunroof, and a usuable rear seat and trunk all for under $51k. meanwhile, 6 cyl bmw 3s and mb cs can touch $44+ without a problem. a define near luxury car as those who's prices start around $30k and provide somewhat uplevel features and safety equipement not found or not standard on cheaper midsized car. there are a few car that bend the rule such as the nissan or toyota. they can be had stripped or equipped with almost every two in the book. a subaru or evo are not near luxury car by any strech of the imagination. however, hear's the real nissanon, how can car like the 3 series and c class be near luxury when people can barely fit in the back seat? i would just have a problem plunking down $40k if i couldn't fit in the back or get a weekends worth of suitcases in the trunk."
1297,"nobody is arguing with you that performance isn't luxury. but, we're saying its not the only criteria to be considered a luxury (or near luxury) sedan. by your standards we'd have to include the neon srt4 here. or why not even an expensive motorcycle?

is a ride in the space honda a luxury? yes. but what the heck does that have to do with a luxury sedan? hey, you can get shot out of a cannon and go really fast. is that a luxury? and, if so, does it have anything to do with this discussion? if a tree falls in the forest .... ah, forget it."
1298,"funny you mentioned this one. i actually test drove one last night, phenomenal performance, especially so at 21k. however, at no time did the word luxury ever enter my mind. but i was still grinning an hour after my drive. this little car has some serious seeds, but it sure isn't luxurious."
1299,"i would agree, that if you don't have leather power seat, you are not luxury. of course, just having them does not luxury make (my 01 honda coupe ex-v6 had a power leather seat, and it was not luxury).

the sti is not luxury. fast? yes. cool? to me, yes, to others yes, to some, no?

would i want one? hell no, not at 34, with three kids.

the 04 tl 6 speed manual with navigation was the best combination of luxury and performace i could get in my price range (also looked at nissan, es, is, pontiac5).

there is obviously a class of car...hmmm...sports sedan perhaps, that combine performance and luxury. some tilt more to performance (is, 3/5 series), some more to luxury (es, pontiac5) and some are a perfect blend of the two...my tl (ducking now as those german fans throw stuff at me).

no way that the sti is a sports sedan. great perfromance. no luxury."
1300,"""i'll say it again. performance is luxury. ""

so my zx-11 ninja is the king of the land then?

luxury is not a function of power and perf. a lincoln and a 3 series are both luxury. as luxury's go, i'd say speed is one of them...but alone it does not a lux car make. how is an sti that most people think is (and is) an subaru ever considered lux? unless the platform is rigid as 3 series or even a volkswagen then forget it. it's an economy car that goes fast..real fast. lux car have luxury and are not annoying to drive tho after a 9 hour trip"
1301,"a-h-h-h you guys are no fun. :-(

does the 911 belong in the ""high end luxury marque"" thread? i say yes and our host pat agreed when the couch-potato-luxury fans tried to throw it out.

sti costs the same as tl and pontiac5... all are available with four doors.

pat, what do you say? does sti get the boot?

;-)"
1302,"look at the topic - ""near luxury"". i am not about to argue that the sti is a luxury car but it could be a near luxury car pretty quickly if subaru so decided. can you say ""saaburu 9-2x"", which is quickly thrwon together car. the sti is not that far away as some are making it out to be.

for 3-4k more: onstar/nav, more leather/suede/aluminum, sound deadining, mcintosh stereo, the plain subaru aero wing for you ""too cool styltoyotaas"" would dress this car up nicely. so for 35-36k you could have a car that blows away all of the popular car in this segment, and still nice enough to take out a young lawyer babe.

never mind the sti though, the new subaru is gonna take care of this segment soon enough."
1303,"than a svt. it's weird, unofficial combination of the starting price, make, content and aim of the vehicle, not the final price loaded.

the imprezza is an econobox at heart, as is the neon. the subaru is a mid-size people mover like the honda and toyota. they're all from manufacturers that are purely pedestrian.

acura's often noted as a tweener company as things like the acura on the low end keep the high end from being taken seriously.

go into nordstrom and you see button downs for $15 like at mervyn's then you're dragging down the brand. and when buying near luxury, you are buying into a brand image - which is entirely perceived.

subaru builds a fast car on a cheap platform. it's a fast, cheap car that has prices which edge toward 30k.

the same can be toyotad of say dodge with its chrysler. it's still in the same exact brand as the 14k neon."
1304,who knew?!
1305,"to me pontiac5 is near luxury performance sedan. it has good performance, good sound system, features of luxury car.

on the other hand, sti does not even try to become one. yes it has performance, but thats about it. no more and the price tag of this car is below near luxury performance sedan. loud engine, no radio. i dunno but imo luxury means toyota, relaxing car environment, quiet ride, and maybe auto features for all devices such as dual auto climate, auto on off light, rain sensing wiper, auto honda (just kidding).

cts-v, 5 series price tag is above near luxury sedan."
1306,"i'm not saying sti is luxurious in terms of butt-fluffing toyota. i'm saying its price tag qualifies it as ""near luxury"". and as a butt-kickin' ""performance sedan"", it qualifies as an appropriate subject of connissantion in this thread."
1307,"it's because of these ""purely pedestrian"", ""cheap platform"" car that we have the nice affordable performance car options we have today. the recent crossover suv, awd sedan platforms today owe themselves to subaru. the subaru/subaru started the trend. the subaru kicked it up a notch for sedan. why do you think bmw came out with a zhp perfododgece package, out of their nature for value? why are so many sedan in the 240-280hp range? prior to the subaru we were stuck at 175-220hp.

omg - infiniti is now a luxury brand. ok ;] who knew?

acura, infiniti, lincoln, saab, volvo are premium brands. audi, jag, and lexus are luxury brands. infiniti is moving up but not quite there.
subaru is a premium brand in terms of engineering but not there in terms of prestige. the upgraded subaru might change that perception.

never mind the sti, the new subaru is gonna take care of this segment soon enough."
1308,"the imprezza starts at under 20k. it's not a near luxury vehicle. i can drop 10k worth of extras on a toyota toyota and get its price to 30k. that car is still a toyota and it's still based on a toyota.

price does not equal luxury status. nobody calls a 35k ford a near luxury vehicle. or a 40k ford a luxury vehicle. it's still a ford."
1309,"if an es300 was on sale for $10k would that make it no longer near-luxury? would it be out-luxuried by a 15k dune buggy?

i think everyone understands that the lichpin for luxury is toyota. to me, climate control is a big must-have for any luxury car. quiet and some degree of isolation from envronmental harshness is another.

and saab is definitely a luxury car. at a time i had a '97 328 and a '97 900set and the set in several ways was more luxurious (seat), although in several ways not (isolation)."
1310,"i wouldn't consider saab, volvo, audi or acura luxury brands. they're tweener brands - they can't quite get over the hump to being considered on par with lexus or mb.

remember luxury is branding. a ford by nature of being a ford is not a luxury vehicle. the gt is still a ford, regardless of price and performance.

kmart can sell a leather coat with diamonds for 5k but it's still not an armani."

1312,"no matter what subaru will still have sub20k econo car on its roster thus precluding it from being considered a true luxury brand. this is acura's big failing too. if the acura held the bottom rung they might get looked at as a luxury brand. with the tl they could for certain. but the acura is little more than a rebadged honda - much like the old g20 being a rebadged, leather-lined nissan."
1313,"""tweener"" brands are exactly what we are supposed to be talking about here, i do believe. while i agree that defining a ""near luxury performance sedan"" is difficult, we're kinda going all over the map here.

i guess i've been thinking of ""near luxury"" as ""entry level luxury"" and the reality is they could mean two different things. if you thikn about it, the term near luxury would tend to describe vehicles like the new loaded-up honda - because of the word near as in ""close to"" - ""close to"" luxury is not entry-level luxury, and i think for the most part entry-level luxury has been the main ford here.

should we create a price range (how about $32-$42k?) along with a certain level of amenities - leather, premium stereo, climate control, power seat adjustments, upper range of safety features, perhaps navi, available at least as options? what else? how should we quantify ""performance""? i guess that's been a big stumper here, hasn't it.

should we change the name of this discussion? the opening post here does a great job of explaining the creator's intent, but maybe the name creates a little conford. cybersol mar 23, 2002 2:04pm

it would be nice if we could agree on a definition so we could talk about the car instead of spending so much energy on the ford of the discussion itself! :-)"
1314,"i'm sorry but the honda is still a honda, so the price is not relevant. it can't be a luxury car by virtue of its origins. it's not near to or close to being a luxury car.

when i read near or entry-level lux i think of car that are scraping the bottom of the luxury barrel - the 3 series, the c class, is300, es300, type x. these are car from luxury brands that are used to suck in buyers. get them into the luxury fold with low prices and attempt to move them upmarket when they trade out in 3-5 years.

it's a luxury brand selling first the brand and then the amenities - some upmarket bits - but for the most part it's about getting buyers to associate good things with a brand. they want buyers to identify with the brand and hope the buyers are looking to graduate up.

the honda is at the top of the honda food chain. it tops out there so it can't possibly entry-level lux - there is no upsell at the end of the honda tenure.

bmw, jag, mb will all atest to their desire to use their low end entry lux car as a springboard."
1315,"relax, blueguydotcom, i'm not pushing for the honda to be included here, i just used it as an example of a car that might be defined as close, yet not, in any category that includes the word luxury.

and i was puzzling about my own issues with the term ""near luxury"" because to me, the definition of that term has to be not luxury by virture of the word ""near"" which means ""close, but not there"". it's entirely possible that i'm being way too literal here!

i think the car you name are certainly some that this discussion could best serve. i understand your point, but ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"" is an image that is a little overly harsh regarding the very fine vehicles on your ltoyota.

read the first post here - it actually lays out the padodgeeters pretty nicely.

other thoughts?"
1316,"i don't agree with blueguy's reasoning that a car cannot be considered a luxury car because the brand is not a ""luxury"" marque.

for example, i would argue that the phaeton is certainly a luxury car, although volkswagen is not considered a luxury brand.

it's really tough to say what is a ""near luxury perfomance sedan"". my thinking is that car like a loaded nissan and subaru should belong in this group."
1317,"performance sedan.

and all of the issues, prices and comparisons among any of these car should be discussed.

too many hangups with luxury."

we're in the same field i think. i tend to view near/entry lux as a vehicle that doesn't have the full boat of brand cache. a 3 series, while fun, still suffers in many eyes from the fact it's a compact sedan. you own a c or a 3 and it's usually not a big deal. an e class or a 5 series that's a car of breeding - all perception but that's what we're talking about here.

i think the car you name are certainly some that this discussion could best serve. i understand your point, but ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"" is an image that is a little overly harsh regarding the very fine vehicles on your ltoyota.

the average mom and pop car may even cost as much as the c, is, es, etc but those honda/toyota don't offer the visceral pop and the brand of the similarily priced, possibly higher performing counterparts.

remember, the c and 3, like the ml and x, are there to get people into the brand. lexus is was released with one goal: lower the average age of lexus buyers. they want to hook them into the brand at 20, so at 35 the ls is a reasonable jump.

jrock, you mentioned the phaeton. the sales of the phaeton (304 in the usa for january and february combined) would lead one to conclude the general buying public doesn't accept the idea of a luxury volkswagen. it's the company that makes the bug and still does to this day! a 17k bug parked next to a 50k+ phaeton? talk about a blunder by volkswagen."
1319,"the very impressive phaeton has broken new ground and represents ""out-of-the-box"" thinking on the part of volkswagen. given enough time and further refinements (performance/handling wise), the phaeton will definitely give the mb s series and bmw 7 series a run for their money.

i give volkswagen alot of credit for making this bold move. all it takes is a little re-education of the luxury buying public. next thing you know, you take what used to be known as an economy brand in a totally new direction...performance/luxury. only problem is, where does that leave audi?"
1320,"wrong board, that gm rhetoric (leather/sunroof/hp per $$) won't get any traction here.

m"
1321,"tough can of worms.

i thought, at first, entry-level lux might be the ticket to answering the nissanon, but then there are still some problem with that. for instance, the acura acura is, technically, acura's entry level sedan, not the tl. the volvo s40 would be the entry, not the volvo. and the 1-series bimmers would be in the same boat when and if they arrive. yet we can't logically step up to the audi and mercedes benz benz just because we include the 2nd tier from the other brands. so where does that leave us?

we could limit it to certain manufacturers, but i fear this also presents a problem. i think subaru, for instance, may compete very well with the new subaru if they chose to load it up with goodies. is it fair to exclude them just because they can't afford to start up a whole new rebadged brand to accomodate their vehicles with luxo ammenities?

maybe its a more complex answer. like, if the brand has an upscale counterpart, then the base brand is excluded. so audi, but no volkswagen; acura, but no honda; infinity, but no nissan; etc. however, if toyotad brand has no upscale counterpart (i.e., subaru, saab, mb, bmw, volvo, etc.), then it can be considered on its own merits. of course, that still leaves us with the problem of someone complaining the sti should be included although it doesn't even offer a stereo. so we still need to figure what is required at a minimum to make it a car with luxo aspirations. maybe available navigation and power leather seat? can anyone think of something that falls outside those requirements that would be included or excluded here unfairly?"
1322,"i think it is a huge mtoyotaake by volkswagen to try going upmarket. if volkswagen would just concentrate on building the audi brand they would be there. no doubt the phaeton is a luxury vehicle (comparable to the audi), but frankly it is wearing the wrong monicker."
1323,"but why the tl and not the acura? and why the volvo and not the s40?

whereas i agree with you regarding some of these brands that do have extoyotaing upscale brands but come out with a luxurious car under the lower brand, but i'm afraid opening the doors to lower brand names that have an upscale counterpart will then open comparisons of the loaded honda to the tl or acura and the loaded nissan to the pontiac5. where would that lead us?"
1324,"""volkswagen's phaeton is a luxury car for people who prefer to wear their designer labels on the inside of their clothing.

if you can afford a hand-built luxury car but don't need to go around with a three-pointed star or a leaping cat or a flying lady hood ornament to proclaim your arrival, then you may find that this new $64,600 volkswagen more than meets your needs.

we use the word ""more"" because the phaeton offers a luxury car with a 12-cylinder engine for about the price of a v8-powered mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz. phaeton comes standard with features such as a navigation system for about what you'd pay for a basic short-wheelbase 7 series bmw.

volkswagen is moving upscale and the phaeton is its new luxury sedan, the flagship of a fleet that in the north american market includes the volkswagen, new volkswagen, volkswagen, eurovan, volkswagen, and the new touareg sport-utility. in 2006 we should see a modern interpretation of the hippies' favorite, the volkswagen microbus, followed, perhaps, by a new, mid-engine, two-seat sports car. the expansion of the volkswagen brand is part of an effort to widen the scope of the entire volkswagen group, an automotive empire that includes volkswagen, audi, seat, skoda, lamborghini, bugatti and bentley. in 1999, the volkswagen group ranked sixth in worldwide sales, but subsequently has overtaken renault/nissan and daimlerchrysler and trails only general motors, ford and toyota.

the term phaeton dates back to days of horse-drawn toyotaages, and then was applied for special, coach-built touring car with custom features. in the case of the volkswagen phaeton, most of those custom features are included as standard equipment."" -- larry edsall, automotive.com"
1325,"i remember a few years back when i first remember hearing this term ""near-luxury"" car. at the time, most of them were rebadged toyota (es300), nissan (hyundai), etc. thus, many people considered them to basically be fancier toyota et. al., with higher stickers. these car didn't differ much from their platform-mates and were lacking many of the luxury features of the ""true"" luxury car.

it seems to me like the term may be a bit more problematic now. yes, the es330 is still built on the toyota platform and the i35 is still based on the nissan. however, they look a lot different than the base car now, and have quite a few more luxury features than before.

in addition, the lower-end luxury models are now featuring extremely nice interiors, many luxury features, etc. even though my '04 tl is considered near-luxury, the interior still feels every bit as nice to me as my old '93 bmw 525i did, if not more so. now, i'm not going to throw a grenade in the tent by trying to compare the handling of the two car

maybe entry-level luxury is a better term for these car now...

jeff"
1326,"yeah, a very select group are willing to pay 60k for a volkswagen. boy those chevrolets.

this isn't like toyota creating lexus and the groundbreaking 35k ls400. toyota had a great reputation - something volkswagen doesn't have. toyota created a luxury brand from scratch and populated it with a vehicle that mirrored the big boy on the block - mb but for less money. volkswagen's phaeton mirrors...the volkswagen. oh, there's a marketing coup!

lets nail down the logic. we've got a company well known for mechanical and electrical problem offering a high priced luxo-chrysler under the same banner as 16k economy car and the new car most closely resembles a 23-40k mid-size sedan. that's just brilliant.

gosh, i sure hope ford comes out with a plus-sized version of the ford and sells it for 50k. that'd be keen.

branding. that's what it's all about in the luxury arena. ask mb about the maybach."
1327,"the phaeton will be a bigger and much costlier bust than the w8 volkswagen which went nowhere in sales. and that was a $38-40k car. yeah volkswagen quality is in the toilet literally. volkswagen execs. should take a good hard look from japan, you gotta have a solid foundation before you reach for the glam and glitz. why not promote the audi more which never was a big seller instead of handicaping it with a near twin. real smart eh!

but there is good in that volkswagen tech.s will have even greater job security now that the phaeton's out."
1328,"it seems like it would be better for volkswagen to move slowly up market rather than such a large leap. most reviews i've read have been pretty positive, but they all nissanon whether buyers will be willing to forgo the snob appeal to obtain a better value in their luxury car.

the phaeton is a pretty nice looking car (imho) and in some ways it might be nice to have a car that doesn't scream ""i have lots of money"".

as far as quality goes, the bmw 7-series and mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz have been having some quality problem of their own lately.
 
jeff"
1329,"now really, the phaeton and the 7-series and the mercedes benz benz are not anywhere close to the ""near"" or entry-level"" lux category.

how about if we just say $32k to $42k as a minimum requirement for eligibility in this discussion? that would at least keep us within some workable range.

i want to change ""near"" to entry-level"" in the title. how about if i also drop performance? i think that should make unnecessary some of the carryings-on about what belongs here and what doesn't.

let me hear what you have to say and i'll make up my mind tomorrow."
1330,keep performance...otherwise i35 and es330 owners will be in here batoyotaling about smooth rides.
1331,"i'm fine with your suggested changes. dropping ""performance"" from the moniker should only add the es330 (among the imports) to the discussion, as that car is the only car that is decidely ""non-performance"" in this price cateogry.

i read the pontiac5x follow-up test on edmunds, and i pretty much agree with what the writer toyotad. the design of the interior is fine (except i'm not a big fan of the orange lights) and i actually feel that the quality of the leather seat is better than the seat in the tl or the 3 series. hopefully, they'll really lick the dash material quality issues in the 2005 model."
1332,"is that 32k to 42k with or without options? either way? i guess it would have to be, wouldn't it? and i assume we are talking msrp numbers, right? i feel its a given, but you just know someone will be over here saying ""but this guy says he knows a guy who read somewhere that this other guy bought a ctsv for $42k."" so we'll probably want to put a stop to that now and specify its msrp numbers."
1333,"why can't we just accept that everyone has a different opinion of where the near luxury line is drawn.

for example, riez stated that he thinks the is300 is higher on the food chain than the 325i, probably because it has a larger, more powerful engine (and he owns a couple of them).

i however, consider the 325i higher on the food chain than the is300 because it's just as quick, but more refined and mature, in my opinion.

price doesn't work either because of my admittedly biased opinion that the acura belongs in the same league as the 325i and is300 because it offers similar performance and luxury, but only costs $26,000.

and then there's the mazda 6s and v-6 honda, which offer performance and luxury on par with many of the car here, yet they simply lack breeding (brand identification).

for a car to be a true ""near-luxury"" performance sedan, i believe it must possess some combination of all of these traits, in varying degrees.

maybe a formula could be devised assigning points for luxury brand name, overall performance, quality interior/cockpit, exterior elegance, overall driving refinement."
1334,"last night i was thinking that, specifically, the acura would present a problem as a car that falls outside of the price requirements but that many folks would feel belongs here.

i don't feel the mazda competes here just on merit of being slow in a straight line. it is also lacking quite a bit in the luxury department on merit of lacking sound deadening and something i feel should be available on a car that wants to be considered ""luxury"": navigation. so, to me, the mazda belongs here no more than the sti does.

i think the honda is too closely tied to the tl. if the honda is permitted, then you open the doors to the nissan and toyota. and then you might as well include the kia amanti, hyundai hyundai350, chrysler, etc, etc."
1335,"fedlawman... my initial ranking was based on price and layout. the inexpensive fwd/4-cyl car like acura and 9-3 at ""bottom"". a stripped 325i is less expensive than an is300, has less standard equipment, and a smaller engine. plus the 330i is certainly ""higher"" up than the 325i. thus the more expensive, higher performing 330i is ""higher"" up than the is300."
1336,"the manufacturers are fairly clear on their intentions whether or not to compete in the near sporty/luxury segment. it makes decisions pretty clear to me.

acura, infinity, bmw, mercedes benz benz, lexus, etc. = yes
chevrolet, ford, nissan, honda, toyota, etc. = no

just because an honda may have all the bases covered does not mean it should be considered for this topic."
1337,"no one thinks the honda should be here. i mentioned it as an example of how the name of this discussion could be misinterpreted but in no way did i suggest it should be included here.

gee, it's amazing how some things can take on a life of their own sometimes. :-)"
1338,the geo speck made from clay and epoxy has a nav so lets include that! it's funny how we want to exclude the poor hondaians but hey they are not in the same league now are they
1339,"i don't know what that is, but does it also have power leather seat and respectable performance? if so, then it would meet all the requirements i previously mentioned, so maybe i need to take a look at it and, maybe, reevaluate my criteria."
1340,"some would argue that true sport sedan need to be either rwd or awd. fwd car do not have the same ""sporting"" qualities.

discuss amongst yourselves.... ;p"
1341,"been there. done that. and would rather not do it again.

;b back at ya"
1342,"do you agree or not?

1343,"since we're still on the subject, i wouldn't agree with that. first, it's harder to define ""luxury"" in terms of brand rather the a specific car. for example, the q45 has more luxury than every lexus sedan except the ls430. and i'm not sure how infiniti and subaru belong in the same category, even if we are talking about brands as a whole. subaru makes 20k to 30k car. infiniti makes 30k to 60k car.

this is how i would rank in terms of cachet/prestige/name recognition:

1) mb, bmw, jaguar, lexus
2) audi, cadillac
3) acura, infiniti, lincoln, saab, volvo
4) volkswagen, toyota, honda, nissan, mazda, subaru, etc."
1344,"it's funny how my '03 nissan se has more luxury features (easy entry-exit feature, heated steering wheel, auto-on headlights...)than the '03 tl-s, 3series, and is300. now if you think by merely having real wood on the 3series making it more luxurious than the nissan, then i rest my case....it's an individual thing.

maybe we should compare car based on their own merits and not on their perceived images; read brand names."
1345,"do not agree. it's the placement of the vehicle on a luxury brand's scale that determines if it's a near/entry level lux.

the 3, c, audi, is300 are all near/entry. they're not luxury car though. they're the feeders to fill coffers and get brand loyalty. these car extoyota at the bottom of a luxury brand's offerings.


infiniti

saab

volkswagen

no way in hades is subaru near anything luxury. subaru makes economy and joe blow car. if you sell a car for under 20k there's no way any vehicle from the brand can be considered luxury. it goes against the concept of luxury branding.

as i've stated before, kmart brand can sell a coat for $5k but in the end it's still a kmart brand coat.

a nissan max loaded to the gills is still from the same brand as the nissan and nissan. it may be the most expensive car in that brand but the brand itself is common place.

an entry-level lux car is the bottom rung of the luxury brand's offerings. if the brand sells anything approaching economy car it most certainly can not be a lux brand or offer anything that can be termed entry-level lux. why is this a tough concept for people?"
1346,"infiniti is a brand that has shot up these last two years. howver prior to that it wasn't very highly considered, particularly in view of its' rebadged vehicles.

let me admit i am a big subaru fan. subaru's are fairly highly regarded, if they weren't why do you see all the awd and sportwagons out these days. i will agree that adding it to the premium segment is touchy, but thats only because of the prior level of interior refinement and powertrain options. the chassis/platforms and worldwide engine drivetrains are considered top notch. the us is finally geting the nicer equipment, plus nicer vehicles are in the works. all the brands seem to be getting into the entry level market, so no problem with suabru having entry level car."
1347,wouldn't europe's mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz a-class and bmw bmw compact (and soon the 1-series) disqualify those two companies by your standards?
1348,"those models do not extoyota in the us and if they did bmw would be very worried about diluting its brand. bmw dumped the 318ti because it was viewed as diminishing the brand. read up on the worries from business analysts about the 1 series and mb's bust of a c coupe. as bmw and mb reach more downmarket they risk becoming just another brand like mazda, subaru or chevrolet. sales numbers too threaten bmw's branding as they expand.

lie down with dogs..."
1349,"you wrote ""the 3, c, audi, is300 are all near/entry. they're not luxury car though."" i agree.

now about the kmart thing: are you saying that even if the same objects can be had from kmart and, say, neiman marcus, they're still not the same?!?! are we talking about placebo effects here??

i think it's only fair to compare things on what they have to offer and not their ""perceived"" images. after all, we're not comparing brandnames here.......or are we?

carlisimo, well put. i was thinking of the same thing. been there, done that, for bmw and mb.......lie down with dogs.

o.k. now all you bmw, mb and lexus fans can start throwing stones now :-)"
1350,"the whole branding thing makes no sense to me. but what if we toyotad this: a luxury brand is somewhat defined by it's dealerships and service. if you can get service loaners, some period of free service, and the dealerships are attractive and have a good chance of serving cappucino--it's likely a luxury car.

i still think that significant noise(say, low seventies cruising)/shock supression, top-tier safety, amenities such as climate control,leather, heated seat, and respectable power ( say, 0-60 in <8 seconds ) are really requirements for luxury."
1351,"now about the kmart thing: are you saying that even if the same objects can be had from kmart and, say, neiman marcus, they're still not the same?!?! are we talking about placebo effects here??

not the same objects though. i specifically stated a kmart coat, just like a honda honda, is by definition a product of the kmart/honda brand.

i think it's only fair to compare things on what they have to offer and not their ""perceived"" images. after all, we're not comparing brandnames here.......or are we?

yes we are. entry-level luxury has everything to do with branding. you can't brand a nissan a luxury car as the brand is synonymous with being plebian."
1352,this discussion reminds me of the clinton hearing. it depends on what the meaning of is is.
1353,"i still think that significant noise(say, low seventies cruising)/shock supression, top-tier safety, amenities such as climate control,leather, heated seat, and respectable power ( say, 0-60 in <8 seconds ) are really requirements for luxury.

who makes the car determines if it's luxury. ask volkswagen and it's flailing phaeton how much good it does you to be the people's car yet you've got all the same gizmos as a 7 series.

you don't simply sell a car. you're selling someone a brand. nike, nordstrom, mercedes benz benz...all carry weight by virtue of branding."
1354,"do you agree or not?

1355,"i agree that modding the engine to increase horsepower is a very viable thing. however:

1. you run the risk of terminating your warranty as the dealer can rightly claim increasing hp/torque with unauthorized mods put undue stree on the engine/driveline components that cause the failure.

2. i do not believe these same mods contribute to an overall increase in gas mileage.

3. you decrease the life and reliability of your vehicle.

but, it is your vehicle, you take your chances and believe what you want about the dealer fixing any engine/drivetrain issues with these mods."
1356,"well, i don't agree with you at all--but you can be as superficial as you choose.

i still think if you put 100 people in a decked-out toyota versus one of the low-end mercs or bimmers you get in europe--the vast majority will pick the toyota as more luxurious.

dave"
1357,"they may say the toyota feels more luxurious, that doesn't change the impact of branding. once the brands are revealed most people will change their tune.

the fact remains most people are influenced by branding. like it or not most cats will cruise up to a subaru and a mb and they'll have instant views of quality, luxury, etc based purely on the badge."
1358,"brand name, charactertoyotaics of a car or price limiter?

1. if brand is the main qualifier then we couldnt include phaeton eventho phaeton is a bit more than just near luxo (bcuz most of its product is non premium vehicle).
we have to include all lexus sedan eventho some of them doesnt have 'performance'.

2. if charactertoyotaic is the main qualifier then all sedan which qualify as premium/near luxo perf. have to be included too (such as volkswagen phaeton but not es330). but then we have to define the term of luxury(unfortunately how hard the car tries to be luxurious, it's brand name tells people otherwise) and maybe we have to define the term of performance too.

3. if price is the main qualifier then sti have to be included if we include pontiac5 based on its stripper price tag. it certainly would include es330 but not cts-v. and maybe we have to define what price range that could be considered as the 'premium'

some people might/-not consider these sedan as premium/near luxury performance sedan: es330, 1 series, 325i, acura, phaeton, cts-v, new honda, subaru sti bcuz of various reasons. underpower, price such as over 40k or less than 30k, regular brand name, no luxury features/ no radio.

aahhh idk"
1359,"""an entry-level lux car is the bottom rung of the luxury brand's offerings. if the brand sells anything approaching economy car it most certainly can not be a lux brand or offer anything that can be termed entry-level lux. why is this a tough concept for people?""

it's not a tough concept. some people just don't agree with you and your definition.

i agree that there are brands considered ""luxury."" i don't agree that a car must be under such a brand name to be considered an entry luxury vehicle.

different concept of ""luxury"", i guess."
1360,"a coat labelled kmart, neiman marcus, or any other ""prestigious"" brands doesn't necessarily mean it was manufactured by those companies individually. it probably comes from the same off-shore sweat shop.

""you don't simply sell a car. you're selling someone a brand. nike, nordstrom, mercedes benz benz...all carry weight by virtue of branding."" true. but a wise buyer should know what he/she is really buying.

nissan, honda, mazda, subaru.....are not luxury brand , and never will. i never say they are. i'm comparing the luxury aspects car-to-car.

i just hope that we're not going to compare performances of these ""entry luxury"" car based solely on brands and what those manufacturers claim their products can do.

i have toyotad in other forums that my next car will most likely be a 3series. but that decision is based on factors other than the luxury, performance, or brandname aspects of the car. up to now i've never, and never will, thought of a 330i as being more luxurious or of better brand than my current nissan.

more power to the placebo effects. nuff toyotad. cheers."
1361,"branding does not make a vehicle luxure or not. even though volkswagen is not a luxury brand phantom is a luxury car. sales have nothing to do with it , if people don't buy it does not mean it's not luxury vehicle.

in my opinion full size luxury car are:

745/760, mercedes benz benz, q45, ls430, audi, phantom.

midsize luxury:

5- series, e class, rl, audi, m45, pontiac30/330, s type.

and finally near luxury, or entry luxury:

3 series, acura/tl, is, pontiac5, c class, x type, cts, es330.

now, if you want to add performance than 325, acura, es330, c230 disqualified so i have only 6 vehicles left:

330, tl, pontiac5, c320, cts and is(would not include is for luck of power, but it handles grate)

i like tl best out of this group, nice handling, lots of power, tones of luxury, grate price. i would probably go with 330, but don't like the interior, and way to much money."
1362,"it makes no sense to have a discussion completely consumed with what the belongs in the discussion and what does not.

i think that the suggestion that the entry-level lux category is the lowest sedan offering of a brand that is *generally* accepted as presenting the intent of a ""luxury"" appeal is a good one. i think two good additions to that thought are that the sedan shouldn't exceed the $40-42k'ish range in a common configuration, and that maybe we'll include the 2nd bottom vehicle in some cases (acura and tl, s40 and volvo/volvor).

so i'm exercising my, um, royal power :-), and declaring that this discussion is about the following vehicles:

acura acura and tl
audi audi
bmw bmw
cadillac cts
infiniti pontiac5 and maybe i35
jaguar x-type
lexus is 300 and maybe es 330
mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz
volvo volvo/volvor and maybe s40

i'm not adding volkswagen for a couple of reasons. generally speaking, one does not (at least so far) think of that brand when thinking of lux vehicles. there is the phaeton, but in no way is it in an ""entry level"" class. so the way i see it, it doesn't belong here either way.

i'm changing the name to entry-level luxury performance sedan from near luxury performance sedan if for no other reason than to make me feel better about the name! but i'm leaving the ""performance"" part, so feel free to not discuss the ""maybe"" vehicles if you think they don't belong.

if anyone feels strongly that i have overlooked something important, speak up within the next day or so, or forever hold your peace!

thanks to all of you for your efforts in trying to get this nailed down.

now, let's talk about car and not about the discussion! okay?

:-)"
1363,"a coat labelled kmart, neiman marcus, or any other ""prestigious"" brands doesn't necessarily mean it was manufactured by those companies individually. it probably comes from the same off-shore sweat shop.

so true. i'd never argue one automatically means quality.

true. but a wise buyer should know what he/she is really buying.

you've just eliminated 99.9% of the buying public.

i have toyotad in other forums that my next car will most likely be a 3series. but that decision is based on factors other than the luxury, performance, or brandname aspects of the car. up to now i've never, and never will, thought of a 330i as being more luxurious or of better brand than my current nissan.

you're in the minority on this. i would agree with you but most would feel otherwise. mention you have a max and nobody cares. mention the mb or bmw and the majority of people have a reaction based on the brand and what it's associated with. good or bad, brand plays a big role in how the majority of the world views products.

more power to the placebo effects. nuff toyotad. cheers.

yeah, i had a friend reselling ugly, bland ugg boots on ebay before xmas. she was nearly doubling her investment."
1364,"pat - i think the saab 9-3 merits the ltoyota. the features and interior are at least as nice as he cadillac, jag, infiniti, volvo. the power and drive of the aero model put it close also."
1365,"i considered the 9-5. but i don't think the saab brand presents as a a lux brand, nor makes people think of luxury ... am i wrong?"
1366,"i did not know you care much about what other people think about your car.

i buy car because i like it not because others think it's prestigious or not.

as for 2004 nissan, material wise it's worse than 2003, almost as cheap as nissan."
1367,"i say include it , it makes no difference what the brand is , it's about individual vehicles. es330 has no performance, but you still decided to include it. 9-5 does not have much luxure but good performance"
1368,"i think people think about saab like they think about volvo or acura. not on the level of bmw or lexus, but above toyota or nissan.

not too sure though."
1369,"i've always thought of saab as a 'tweener. definitely above the basic japanese and american brands. so i think it belongs. come to think of it, are there any ""base"" european brands offered here in the us?

i can't make an argument for the new subaru subaru gt just yet because its not here. if it comes with the options for power leater and navigation (that might be where it falls short), does 0-60 in the anticipated sub 6 seconds, and breaks $30k (which it probably will), then i'll probably be fighting for it to be included."
1370,"and this is exactly where it gets too hard.

i think we need to stick to the brands that are striving to present a luxury image as a whole. subaru is not one of those, and i don't think saab is either.

we've got to draw the line somewhere and talk about the car instead of the discussion. it's going to be somewhat arbitrary and not everyone is going to agree, but if we are going to have a meaningful connissantion we have to define the padodgeeters and then stay within them.

ya know?"
1371,"in the interests of keeping things simple, i suggest, pat, that you lose the ""maybes"" from your ltoyota and add saab 9-3 and 9-5. i agree with jrock65 that saabs are perceived as being more upscale than the nissan, toyota, honda etc., more or less in the same bracket as volvos.

there is some truth to every perspective on the issue of what car belong in this discussion. car use combination brands -- the make and the individual model name -- to, perhaps, benefit from both family branding and individual branding. so, while there is some halo effect from the make, the dominant perception is one based on the individual model. people may swear by the ""nissan"" while detesting the ""nissan"", for example. a person driving around in a ""land chrysler"" is looked upon very differently than one tooling around in a ""toyota."" so, in my view, it is more meaningful to discuss specific models as being in the upscale performance sedan category. in some (hopefully, rare) cases, therefore, car from so-called ""lesser"" makes may deserve to be discussed in this forum as well.

there are as many ""best buys"" as there are people. it is, after all, a function of priorities driven by individual and/or family needs and wants. every car is a compromise among competing demands, just as every purchase decision is. a lot of the firepower in these forums, while highly entertaining, is often misdirected. a lot of the criticism of different car (and, occasionally, their owners!) is analogous to faulting the lion for not having the grace of a gazelle!:)

just my 2c!:)
raj"
1372,"thank you, pat, for just putting a ltoyota together!

fwiw, i think saab belongs here. the 9-3 and 9-5 are cross-shopped with all of the above car, at least in my area (ny).

suburu might build an amazing $30k subaru, but it doesn't belong here. just my $0.02."
1373,"i agree, the saab's belong and the subaru doesn't.

sorry, but i also believe that, like it or not, branding does play a role in this subject.

for example, if the lexus is300 was sold here as the $25,000 toyota altezza, it would not qualify as ""entry-level lux."" instead, it would provide good competition for the mazda 6."
1374,people reacted more to my saab than my bmw--i think it belongs.
1375,"i did not know you care much about what other people think about your car.

i do care because since i've purchased a bmw i've found i'm treated quite differently when people connect me with the car. for the most part the experiences have been quite negative but the fact remains in my protege i'm anonymous. not so in my other car.

i buy car because i like it not because others think it's prestigious or not.

i never wrote you or i did otherwise. but when you read the reasons most people buy car it's rarely related to how the car drives - reputation for dependability and resale is what drives honda and toyota in such a big way."
1376,"fwiw, i think saab belongs here. the 9-3 and 9-5 are cross-shopped with all of the above car, at least in my area (ny).

wow in all my time helping friends and family drive car i've only gotten one person to even test drive a saab. she thought it was nice if underpowered. i have two friends who were raised on saabs and there seems to be some kind of genetic code that passes from parent to child to get the kid into saabs.

when i did my looking, the saab never entered my radar. front wheel drive and gm...running for the hills."
1377,"i agree with what you're saying for the most part, but the phaeton is most definitely a full-on luxury car, reguardless of the badge. it might have the wrong badge and sits in the wrong showroom, but it is the real deal.

ppontiac8477,

i take it you mean the phaeton, not the phantom? the phantom is a rolls-royce, and it is several times more luxury car than anything being discussed in this topic.

m"
1378,"it is a car that defines near luxury. the 2004 is selling at about 28,000 after discounts and incentives. i think it has the most bang for the buck in the near luxury class.

and the soon to be released chryslerc hemi version should also be considered although i think it may be eligible for the luxury car class, not just near luxury. it will sell for around $34k very well equipped.

i own a 2000 chrysler with 70k on the dial and it still rides as good as the day i got it. some of the members of the chrysler enthusiasts club claim (with some slight modifications) that they get under 15 second quarter mile times. and the car just has very untoyotaue and classy styling"
1379,"but if subaru is being disallowed, then so is chrysler ... no matter how nice or expensive it may be."
1380,"just wanted to add lincoln ls to the ltoyota.

and i still vote for saab. if its not in the same category as volvo and acura, then where is it? its definitely not competing with honda and nissan."
1381,"chrysler is actually a luxury brand hondaing to mercedes benz benz...the crossfire would be here if it had 4 doors and the chrysler is a pretty well done luxury hybrid....people may not recieve chrsyler as a lux brand but they certainly intend to be one. everyone wants some entry lux pie and soon enough even the sutoyotaie may have to be included despite the branding thing.

fact is affluence is out there even where you dont see it and those ""stealty wealthy"" may just be able to get the lux and not the badge and the uninvited perceptions that a merc or bimmer bring you. the wealthiest people i know drive honda and the pay checks to paychcks drive 5 series. a company like subaru can give those who like to be unseen a little of what a bimmer offers without the price or the bs."
1382,"a company like subaru can give those who like to be unseen a little of what a bimmer offers without the price or the bs.

rofl. scoobies have one big strike right off the bat: awd. another would be cheap interior materials. one more would be the total lack of style inside and out. kia rio exterior and interior pretty well matches the subaru.

the subaru/sti is a fast car. that's all it offers. if speed were the only criteria for getting a car most of us would be driving around in one of those buzzy, chincy econoboxes."
1383,"aren't the lexus 330 and the chrysler substantially about luxury with no significant emphasis on performance?

i know we could say acceleration equals some form of performance, but i was thinking the handling aspect comes into play as well.

imho i look at the ls as more luxury than anything else.

the saab 9-3 and 9-5 belong in my eyes.

just my .02."
1384,imo subarus do not belong in this category while the saab 9-3 should definitely be added to the ltoyota.
1385,"thanks for the support. i can see the arguement for calling it a ""tweener"" brand, but it is a brand really shopped by people also looking and can afford acuras, audi's, bmw's, and volvos. i hope pat will add them to the ltoyota.

as for subaru, i will give up the ghost. although i think it deserves a consideration, maybe not yet until the updated models come out and prove something. but note subaru is also cross shopped with acura, audi, audi, bmw and volvo for sure. note also, all the brands mentioned in this topic have reacted to what subaru has done, so the other brand managers know whats up.

i wont argue awd vs rwd, it's a preference. but awd provides awesome driving toyotamics for a multitude of surfaes and conditions.

the chryslerm deserves consideration, not for the brand but the car itself."
1386,"""rofl. scoobies have one big strike right off the bat: awd. another would be cheap interior materials. one more would be the total lack of style inside and out. kia rio exterior and interior pretty well matches the subaru. ""

the subaru is a tin can...i was referring to a 250hp upscaled sedan for 05 - the subaru. of course its awd but so is the a-4. and while i wont buy one i know pleny of people making 300k who would. they just dont care about rwd the way we do! ...and they dont care about affluence but will spend 32k no problem. this is a great segment with lots of people and lots of $...all the rules are changing fast and even kia and hyundia have nothing to stop them from competing too even in rwd format someday soon."
1387,"""the wealthiest people i know drive honda and the pay checks to paychcks drive 5 series.""

wow, the wealthiest people i know drive $300k car, care about rwd and have interesting automobile collections, but what has that to do with the price of tea? seems like some of this connissantion is about the type of person that drives one of these car and not the type of car a person drives."
1388,"first, this isn't about wealthy or not wealthy people. it is about entry-level luxury performance sedan. we aren't here to talk about people; we're here to talk about car. let's not get into categorizing (generalizing, assuming, stereotyping) the folks who drive them.

now, as your host, i am officially declaring this discussion about the following vehicles and no others:

acura acura and tl
audi audi
bmw bmw
cadillac cts
infiniti pontiac5 and maybe i35
jaguar x-type
lexus is 300 and maybe es 330
mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz
saab 9-3 and 9-5
volvo volvo/volvor and maybe s40

as i toyotad earlier, feel free to not discuss the ""maybes"", but i'm not going to rule them out. if you want to talk about them, talk about how they do or do not fit the ""performance"" description along with anything else of interest.

i am ruling out all other suggestions, though, for the reasons stated earlier. those reasons include the fact that we should keep this to a marque that intends to convey luxury across its spectrum, it is nonsensical to have a never-ending discussion about what the discussion is about and most importantly, it's time to draw the line.

so here it is - talk about the car in my ltoyota or go make another discussion if you need to talk about something else. just keep in mind that another vague, undefined category doesn't serve any purpose. to keep it useful, interesting and productive, be sure to clearly define the topic.

okay? have at it!!

:-)"
1389,"first of all, thanks pat for adding the saabs to the ltoyota.

right now, fourteen bmw bmw drivers are wondering how they got whooped by a fwd, 4 banger."
1391,"ooh boy those rwd only folks have got a task on their hands coming up with an explanation as to how this could have happened. i guess the guy driving the acura didn't know he didn't stand a chance because of torque steer and knowing in advance those rwd guys had ""perfect balance"".blah blah blah
once again that old addage turns out to be true..when the green flag drops, the bs stops!"
1392,"between the tl and 3series. it depends on your priorities. if i wanted seat of the pants bmw, for 3 series prices, it would be zhp at the top of the ltoyota. if i cared not about the precision feel of a bmw and slickness of the looks and just needed a car.. i will admit if those were the only 14 car in the universe, it would be the acura tl."
1393,"i haven't driven one yet, but by all accounts and specs thus far, i'd have to say the new s40 t5 6-speed is going to be high up on this ltoyota for me. certainly much higher than number 11 (looking at buddha's ltoyota)."
1394,"volvor would probably outperform any car on the ltoyota, but it's a bit expensive. i would consider 330 but new model should come out soon. if only tl would come in awd. i think tl with a-spec would handle as well as 330 performance package, but 5k+installation is to much."
1395,"i find it quite amusing that for 5 pages or so the discussion forded on what the discussion was about. reminds me so much of meetings meant to talk about other meetings.

i think pat's ltoyota is a good one. one addition in both my opinion and from magazines that compare vehicle in this class would be the lincoln ls. first of all, lincoln is obviously meant to be ford's luxury brand. secondly, the ls costs between 30-42k in most configurations. third the car itself definitely has both luxury and performance intentions. by all owner accounts, it performs and handles well, even if i personally would not be interested in a ford product at this time, so that i have not driven one.

back to talking about car... if i were shopping today, taking into account that my priorities are size, performance, price, reliability, and then luxury... these sedan would be on my shopping ltoyota in this order:

1) infiniti pontiac5
2) acura tl
3) bmw 330i
4) everything else

enjoy, cybersol"
1396,"i toyotad it before, and i'll say it again, i really think this needs to be added.

hondaing to c&d, 0-60 in 6.5 and:
in most track trials, the lincoln set hyundai marks. although it was wearing all-weather tires, usually thought to be a disadvantage, it outran all but the mercedes benz benz on the skidpad and topped all in the lane-change test. very shrewd choices were made in the chassis tuning of this car.

and since the sport v8 comes in at $40,500 with delivery, the only fault i see with it is the lack of a manual tranny. but i don't see that as a reason to exclude it because some folks prefer an auto and some even require it."
1397,"ls is no near luxury, if anything it would compete with 5 series gs, rl and e class."
1398,"""ls is no near luxury, if anything it would compete with 5 series gs, rl and e class.""

not even close to these. imo of course. yes if you measure rear legroom, but all of the above vehicles are a cut above the ls in terms of amenities. the ls has no more luxury than a mountaineer."
1399,"you right, i was also referring to size. ls is a to big to be considered near luxury, and not enof luxury and quality to go up to mercedes benz benz."
1400,"... nominations for ""the ltoyota"" are no longer being accepted ...

anyone want to talk about the car that are on the ltoyota?

1401,"ummm... yeah... ok... sure... the lincoln has a whopping 3.8 inches in length over the cts and the cts even has more rear legroom.

but, regardless, i've grown tired of getting disciplined by the principal. so have at it."
1402,"i went through all of the comparisons of the car on this ltoyota in january while i was trying to decide which car to order. i ended up ordering a cts with the luxury/sport package and the dvd navigation system. (blue chip exterior, light gray/ebony interior).

i drove the bmw 3 series and liked its driving charactertoyotaics, but didn't care for its styling or interior room. the same can be toyotad for the mercedes benz benz c class..i drove a v6 version and while it was a solid quiet riding car, it didn't have the interior space i was looking for.

i very seriously considered the lexus es 330, but ultimately decided that while it rode very smooth and quietly, the handling just wasn't there. the fact that it basically looked like a toyota didn't help either.

  i had a bad prior ownership experience with a honda, so did not consider the acura.

  the cts seemed to have exactly what i was looking for. a quiet toyotaable ride combined with hyundaient handling, plenty of interior space in both the back and front seat, and a very refined smooth and powerful engine. the real bonus for me is the styling of the exterior though...the cts is one fine looking car from any angle, and doesn't look like just another box on wheels.

i checked with my dealer today and he expects my car to be delivered within the next week or so. i'm looking forward to that."
1403,"well, here is something that autospies has to say about the next 3. doesn't really say anything that people didn't know or were speculating already.

http://www2.autospies.com/article/insubaru.asp?articleid=2742&ca- tegoryid=11

i don't think bmw is going to keep the price of the car same or lower with more standard features. they did really jack up the price of the new 5. we'll see."
1404,"took my acura to a bmwcca track event yesterday at pacific raceways. perfect weather, beautiful car, and a terrific experience.

my fwd 4-banger kept up just fine with all those e46 325's. i lapped more than a few inexperienced drivers hondaing e46 330's, and even paced a well driven e36 bmw for one complete lap...what a blast! then i got a 4 lap ride in a '96 porsche 911 turbo. wow!

what else...two 350z's were out on the track - they sound awesome (nice throaty exhaust) accelerating down the straight-away and through turn 1. also, one guy had a late model lotus esprit, and there were two subaru sti's out there. one of the sti's was in my group and got behind me, seemingly out of nowhere. i pontiacd him past me after exiting turn 9 and he passed me like i was standing still (i was doing about 60)!

overall, a terrific club and an awesome day of fun at pacific raceways!"
1405,"last week on the highway, this guy in a subaru sti drove up behind me and was riding my bumper...for a short time. fed up with his arrogant behavior, i dropped my '04 tl's stick from 5th to 3rd, hit the gas, and left him in the dust, and i didn't even have to floor it. he finally caught up to me, so i did it to him again (6th to 4th). he never did pass me and i'm sure i ruined his day. i won't say how fast i was going but the tl surprised even me."
1406,"two options here:

1. the driver wasn't playing like you were.
2. the guy didn't know how to use turbos. your v6 with 238lb-ft of torque on a 3400 lb car really isn't a match for a person who knows how to use the sweet spot of their turbos on a car that sports 300 lbs-ft at 4000 rpm and the car weighs 200 lbs less. in fact, it's a one sided affair."
1407,"i finally had a chance to watch the race this afternoon (i taped it earlier this morning).

it was a very exciting race, and also great to see a brand new car with little development time (acura) do so well against the established benchmark (325i).

it was also interesting to note how evenly matched all of the car in this competition are, even though there is a combination of fwd and rwd, and ""luxury"" (bmw 325i) vs. ""economy"" (nissan nissan).

which begs the nissanon - if rwd vs. fwd doesn't matter at chrysler, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on i-90?"
1408,"3. could be another iteration of the old rope a dope game. let some dope charge ahead and get nailed by the cop before you get there. pretty easy to play, just find somebody with a new car and act arrogant, then see if they reciprocate.

the best place to prove a point with your right foot is at a race track."
1409,...what it's like to have some jackass ride your bumper.
1410,"oh, he was playing all right. i expected him to outrun me. it just didn't happen. as for the one-sided thing, you severely undertoyotate the capability of the tl. in fact, a tl owner on another discussion board had his 6-speed dynoed and it regtoyotaered 282hp, not 270hp. could it be that the subaru is overrated and the tl, underrated?"
1411,"it's like somebody is behind you, so what. you really have several choices: you can ignore them and ltoyotaen to the nice sterio, you can slow down so they get tired and pass you, you can take the next exit/turn, or you can floor it in an attempt to teach the arrogant so and so a lesson with your car."
1412,"""oh, he was playing all right. i expected him to outrun me. it just didn't happen. as for the one-sided thing, you severely undertoyotate the capability of the tl. in fact, a tl owner on another discussion board had his 6-speed dynoed and it regtoyotaered 282hp, not 270hp. could it be that the subaru is overrated and the tl, underrated? ""

how does one measure the hp at the crank? is there a special dyno for this is or did the tl owner do some funky math to get from the wheels to the crank? my guess is the math involved to make the 282 leap is rather fuzzy at best. the tl is one great value if you can stomach the wheel jerking from your hand once in a while but it is not sti beater.

if the sti was between 4500 and 7000 the whole time you would have seen nothing but fumes. the power band of the tl is quite evident in the 50-120 stats and 0-100.. i suggest you take a look at the sti stats for those metrics before you get too enthusiastic about the less than torque ridden 3.2.

""which begs the nissanon - if rwd vs. fwd doesn't matter at chrysler, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on i-90? ""

this explains much - i suggest anyone nissanoning rwd in context of freeway driving actually drive a decent rwd car on some back roads. if someone thinks they are going to enjoy - let alone accept the seemingly foreign concept of throttle induced overteer on the highway, i imagine they will be out of the genepool soon enough.

the oversteer i paid 35k for is never enjoyed on a highway - it's enjoyed on the hairpins of an open field with a two lane country road with 10 foot tall cows and fog smoked expanses and no one in sight....and carefully pressing the throttle just enough, with just enough feedback to push the weight back to the rear wheels just as that very power causes them, with buttery smooth finesse, to slide into the perfect exit angle and keep traction where wide open throttle can push your back into the leather.

unless you've actually experienced this you will keep wondering!"
1413,"this was gone over several times--scca adds balast to car to make them competitive, and each brand has a minimum weight. it's designed so as to make the drive the issue, not the vehicle.

that being toyotad, i would look at a fwd car next ( i like the new 9-3 ), since i'm willing to sacrifice soem handling for other attributes, but i wouldn't feel the need to fool myself into thinking that wasn't doing so.

there are some reasonable folks out there in this world! there is nothing wrong with fwd and for most it will serve it's purpose. at least you understand that works great and suitable dont mean better....many struggle here."
1415,"chris - i never denied that driving a rwd car wasn't satisfying (i own a miata, after all), i just toyotad that rwd has no significant performance advantage over a properly driven fwd car.

dhanley - all else being equal (tires, power:weight, etc.) a rwd car and fwd car, if properly driven, will yield similar lap times. the techntoyotaue is a little different, but the end result is the same."
1416,"bmw's so conerned with brand image, the 1 may not get released in the us without a 6:

http://thecarconnection.com/insubaru.asp?article=6967

bmw 1-series stuck?

one thing's for sure: bmw is not planning on bringing its 1-series to the u.s. anytime soon. reports published in recent days by detroit trade papers say that the company will either kill the u.s. 1-series project or delay it significantly based on comments made by tom purves, ceo of bmw north america. purves retoyotadly says that the case for bringing the smallest of bmw-badged vehicles to america is still being made and the company is deciding currently which iteration(s) - coupe, hatch, or convertible - it would bring here. he also retoyotadly says that the company's in-line four engines would not gel with the widely-held bmw performance image in the united states, so a 1-series powered by an in-line six is likely, if the vehicle ever shows up here. -jack gilbert"
1417,a weak 4 cylinder could kill an image. didn't the 318 snub asss already kill them back in 90's?
1418,"sorry but there's no way you're gonna convince me in a tl sporting a low torque honda engine (like my low torque bmw engine) stands a chance against a turbo 2.5 scoobie engine. lighter, more torque, broader range.

i stand by my first two options and concur the third option may have been he wanted you to be the point man. i do it all the time. let someone lead the charge by a good 1/5-1/4 of a mile and i'll keep my eyes peeled for anyone blasting onto the freeway with lights blazing.

the tl's a fantastic car. i attended a preview showing the other day for an upcoming audi and among the other vehicles were the volvo, e class, tl and 530i. i'd pick the tl over all of them and twice on sunday. in fact i did continue to choose the tl even once they'd raised the price to 40k. i really do respect the car inside and out but it's not a barn burner like a sti."
1419,"could you put this discussion back on the mercedes benz benz discussion ltoyota? (be that the c is definitely in this category)
thanks!"
1420,"blueguydotcom, i more or less agree with you. like i toyotad, i fully expected the sti to overtake me...he just couldn't. i'm chalking it up to his limited driving skills and having lost his nerve. believe me when i say, he was trying to catch me."
1421,nothing worse than seeing someone with a performance car and no idea how to extract that performance.
1422,"sometimes it is not that the person does not know how to use his/her vehicle to it's full potential but they may not be willing to risk their life like some crazy kid would.

when i was a teenager, i was willing to take more chances when driving my car than i do now...

why? i usually did not considered the consequences and i had far less to lose."
1423,when we were looking at wagons last year we looked at one. once we saw the price with options the looking stopped. curious on people impression on the drive.
1424,yes my soon to be mother in law has one. i'd rather have a v-6 volkswagen 5sp. it's quiet and fairly nice interior but very low on the mercedes benz benz quality scale and not to big not to mention the fact it just looks like a baby s class. it's ok but - so is the 28k volkswagen for that matter. the engine isn't bad but it doenn't beg to be pushed like a g that for shore.
1425,"i drove one at the gm autoshow-on-the-road. they had a loopy test track, and a lot of car to take out on it.

the c320 really handled better than i expected and was very refined. it had a bit more non-melodious engine noise than i expected; i was surprised by that. it was nice, but it was also a 45k car.

the cts was there too. it was nice, but a bit too isolated for me. i like quiet, but i want to feel the road and hear the engine rev. somehow, the interior just seemed to whisper chevrolet. it seemed spacious inside, which probably appeals to other more than it does to me. but if you like the interior and isolation, this is probably a really good car.

drove the 9-5 aero, that was probably my favorite, i really like the looks, interior, the actual out the door price ( they have $6000 in rebates on it now and sell at invoice(??) ) and i love the engine. but it didn't handle as well as the cts or the c320.

the 9-3 was there but it was the base 9-3 linear and didn't impress, mostly due to the interior. the engine needed more power, but the handling was really quite good. it tracked well and had good feedback. i recently sat in a 9-3 convertable at the autoshow later and thought that the interior in it was really nice, so maybe it's improved.

also saw the s40 at the autoshow, and the interior really looked cheap to me, and there were several broken parts inside, which i guess could have been due to it's being a prototype and suffering autoshow abuse. but based on the numbers this is a really good car, so i would look at it again.

i drove an x-type 3.0. the car looks really good, i thought, and the interior is very attractive, but again there were 3 demos at the dealer and 2 had broken parts inside ( one had the cell phone cover broken by the dealership owner ). all the driving controls felt too light to me, and the engine despite its increased hp felt weak at low rpm's--i didn't feel that i could pass on the highway without dropping out of fifth, but i thought it sounded great when i revved it up. i didn't feel that i got a lot of steering feedback but it was also impressively quiet on the highway. the door sill was really high and the back doors only opened 45 degrees so it was hard for me to get in the back.

i drove a new 325i and it's good, but i couldn't help but feel that it's been somewhat lexiified. the shifter had vaguer detents and the engine noise and steering effort were dialed down. i might have liked it a lot more if it had the sport package. i don't like the newer bmw designs, and i look askance at the increasing complexity of these car.

i drove a pontiac5, too, it certainly had a lot of power, and had pretty good feedback. i was mostly turned off by the interior which i felt was pretty cheap and the amount of tire noise that got into the interior ( too much for my tastes ). also, my friend who has one reports really poor mpg.

oh, test drove the is300 as well. i thought it looked ( warning: personal taste issue ) tacky inside, and was too constoyotaently noisy due to road noise. also, the interior didn't fit my fdodgee very well. i thought several car felt better handling around town.

drove a last-gen audi 1.8t. overall thought it felt very composed and had a nice interior, but it definitely needed more engine. also, a friend with a volkswagen has had a dismal reliability experience. but if i was leasing it from a subservient dealer i would probably feel ok about it.

the sporty acuras i've been in (cl-s, acura,acura) i've had a hard time getting toyotaable in, so i haven't even bothered to test drive them. i haven't looked at the new tl-s.

there was nothing that made me feel that i need to go out and trade my bmw, but i want to test a 9-3 arc if i happen to be near a dealer with some free time. i almost hope i hate it so i don't feel the urge to waste money on a car swap.

dave"
1426,"sounds like the c320 drives pretty nice, albeit $$$$$ that's great that you have had the chance for so many drives.

i have an aero wagon, and as much as i like the car, it does need some stiffer springs and stiffer rear sway bar to help the handles. it tracks well but rough stuff in the canyons makes it hit the bump stops and there is more roll. great brakes, and isn't it fast, 0-60 is alright but i tell you people 60-120 in an aero is something else. i wish they would bump up the power in the 9-5 aero. all the saab tuners have emp's to take it to 280-300hp.

i think the 9-3 aero is a sweet looking car. if they bumped it to 250/250 it would be killer."
1427,"agree. the c320 was nice but seemed expensive to me for what it was--solid, quiet, ok handling but not really extraordinary, while having no glaring flaws.

i guess i didn't realize the price of the cts i drove. i want to the caddy website and i see that was probably a $43k car ( 3.6l, xenons, upgraded sterio, sunroof ). but i suppose there will be many thousands off at some point.

the 9-5 was as you describe--swayed more than i liked, and understeer was very easy to provoke; i didn't feel secure pushing it in turns. it's acceleration was so-so 0-30 then after that, really impressive. to be blunt, i thought it was a very well-thought out car suffering from an old chassis; it could have used more suspension travel and structural ridgidity.

i expect the 9-3 areo will be 250hp beofre long, the upcoming 9-3 hatch is supposed to get 250hp out of the same motor with direct injection. you can already get a chip for that hp level, but i shy away from mods and prefer to get the power stock."
1428,any thoughts on the new tl?
1429,"seems like an awful lot of car for 33k. i'd be dumb if i didn't test one before purchasing. i can't imagine it not selling well with its power, features, and price. it even has good epa numbers and impressive safety scores. but i never even sat inside one so i have no constructive comments. i'm trying to make it a new policy to consider if i really have something to say before saying something. ( red green show, anyone?"
1430,i hear the kia spectra is on sale now..
1431,so much for a rwd :-)
1432,"nice shot of the acura being lapped by the 3's. for the second time. ;-)

dhanley: did the cts have the sport package, or just luxury? suspension differences plus 17"" wheels make a big difference between the two. although it is still somewhat isolated and ""roomy"" inside. at 6'2"" i like that feeling personally, i'm more into the 5 series/audi/cts/tl size than acura/3/audi even if the handling is number."
1433,where are the g's for that pic...they must be signing autographs already! oh wait maybe they dont let g's out there with 318's and 2.0 litre acuras.
1434,"i think it had 16 inch rims so it was just luxury. i certianly desire some degree of isolation. the cts i drove just had too much for my tastes. they probably chose the softer car intentionally for the typical driver.

i'm only 5'11 but because of my build and how i sit a lot of car don't have enough headroom for me. even the cl-s puts me into a posture i don't care to maintain. my gripe with many modern seat is they seem either designed for the widening american population, or a person with narrow shoulders.

dave"
1435,"the tri-point mazda team out of canoga park, ca is another fwd power. there 2.0l mazda 323 aka mp3 or now 3 is fwd and it won alot. i beleive it finished second in 2003 to the bmw 328 team. but not bad for a team with less than 3 years on the circuit and way less factory support.

rwd, awd, fwd whatever. at our level as enthusiasts it's all about the driver. as nice as the infiniti and bmw's are to drive the audi or tl can give a similar feel on a canyon road. beleive me most of y'all won't be sliding your tail around on any canyon roads, you will be taking the same safe line of a fwd car. you can drift if you wish, and as cool as that feeling is, it also makes you pucker for a moment so most people don't do it."
1436,"as someone who owns a protege i gotta say the handling's pretty darn good. my car needs the strut tower and i'd prefer 17s over my skimpy 16 inch alloys but it's lightyears beyond the honda, volkswagen, etc.

the big problem with that car: no guts under the hood."
1437,"touring series proven again and again that rwd does not have an advantage even on the race track. fwd can't handle high hp and torque, but in entry level luxury it's not an issue."
1438,"""fwd can't handle high hp and torque, but in entry level luxury it's not an issue. "" \

? this level has 270 base hp for that car. it surpassed imo the threshold at 220hp. in the next 2 years the entry lux car will have 300hp to even compete - new 3 sure will and possibly the 05 g sedan..or has this been quashed yet?"
1439,"also some race track certainly favor fwd car and some fwd car have no understeer since they are so finely and hard tuned and they can even get oversteer in some setups cant they?

what most suggest is that the balance from a rwd setup is superior for street car and that the fun one has while playing with oversteer in the twtoyotaies is way more fun than getting torque feedback in your steering. i would prob take an acura over the 3 in that race..great car."
1440,"understeer and oversteer are both a ""loss of control.""

on the track or on the street, neither one is a good thing. the ideal car is neutral handling all the way to the limit.

yes, it may be fun to play with throttle induced oversteer, and perhaps drift your car through a corner, but if you're doing this on public roads, i hope you've driven the road 1000 times, walked it right before you drive to check for new hazards such as subaru, potholes, debris, etc. that weren't there before, and block off the road at both ends to prevent another car from coming around a corner from the other direction while your coming off an apex and tracking out.

your fantasy is nice and i'm sure you enjoy occasionally inducing the back end of your g to ""get a little loose"" and rotate towards some imagined apex (who doesn't?), but that's hardly a defining rwd ""sport sedan"" moment. i can (and do) enjoy the same effect in my fwd honda.

don't misunderstand me, i understand where you're coming from. from your last post, i can see that you understand me too. my response is mostly directed towards those people that continually spout the superiority of rwd over fwd with drivel such as ""the front wheels have to steer and drive...it's much for them to handle"" or ""true sports car can only be rwd,"" without understanding the mechanics of car control or vehicle toyotamics...it's pure nonsense.

control your car, drive smoothly, follow the proper line, and you'll go fast and never upset the ""balance"" of the car, be it a bmw or acura."
1441,"my bias for rwd comes from that ethereal shove i get when exploding out of a corner just right. hit the corner perfectly you feel yourself pressed down and back in your seat. ah, not much like it. i've yet to find that in a fwd car."
1442,"""yes, it may be fun to play with throttle induced oversteer, and perhaps drift your car through a corner, but if you're doing this on public roads, i hope you've driven the road 1000 times, walked it right before you drive to check for new hazards such as subaru, potholes, debris, etc. that weren't there before, and block off the road at both ends to prevent another car from coming around a corner from the other direction while your coming off an apex and tracking out.

ummm i do this 2x a week at least on exit and entrance dodgeps i can see 360 degrees around. i keep the car loose for about 7-8 seconds all the way around balancing the oversteer and understeer to find the edge of traction - this helps me undertand the limits of the car and how the car reacts to all kinds of inputs. a little spin out (which really wont happen with vdc on) is gonna cause me no problem other than some grass in my springs.

yu dont have to induce oversteer to get what bluguy describes..the shove. it is something that does define the sports sedan's i want to drive - in fact it defines it in such a way that i will never pay more than 20k for a fwd car - more like 18 really.

as far as oversteer you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if rwd in a turn..not much but when the front wheels are turning one way and the other wheels are driving a differnt angle - somthing gives and i assure you it's the rear wheels as they align themselves to the direction of travel to the front...there's just something about the balance you feel as the weight transfers and you propel (shove) down the straight road puit of a turn. no honda can do this man - i'm not sure you really know what this is about."
1443,"...my tl shoving me back in my seat when i accelerate out of a turn, into a straightaway, or whenever."
1444,"the drivetrain is important but it goes hand in hand with the chassis and suspension. thus we have awesome drivers with awd - audi audi quatto (subaru subaru); rwd - bmw 325/330, infiniti pontiac5, lexus is300; fwd - acura tl, saab 9-3 aero. all of these vehicles are fun to fling around corners. i have no problem with putting my money on any of them."
1445,"is that what those rwd bmw's are doing in the race photo above? are they ""shoving"" themselves around the race track....behind that fwd acura ?
a picture is worth a thousand words. the green flag drops..the bs stops."
1446,"lol raher, good point.

i wonder what went wrong with those 17 'superior rwd' car.

2.4l acura engine vs 2.5l 325i engine and still managed to outrun 14 of them, wow!

so much for a rwd theory. who overlapped who?"
1447,"this whole discussion of auto racing reminds me of the frothing folks on bimmerfest harassing me to join their little autocross garbage.

btw, i woulda bought a acura over a 325i. better car and better value in my eyes."
1448,"you're not giving your tl wot out of a corner. you'd end up fighting massive torque steer - assuming the engine's in the sweet spot, which it should be outa the corner."
1449,"i could point out yet again that scca handicaps car, but it would be nice of you guys to acknowledge that i extoyota in your little universe by perhaps calling me a name or something."
1450,"i wont be making any assumption until i see another picture of this with tl instead of acura. otherwise i'd be eating my own words like others.

no theory yet. but i drove acura gsr and i know which one is better. gtg"
1451,"blueguydotcom, you obviously don't know what you're talking about. ""massive torque steer"" doesn't extoyota in the tl. there is torque steer but it's mild and easily handled."
1452,"you're right, my bad. torque steer. i know it's perfectly acceptable to you that the car attempt to redirect itself when accelerating at wot. to each his own."
1453,"issue with decent handling powerful fwders normally isn't oversteer or understeer but torque steer. laws of physics. drive wheel and steering wheels one and the same. plus front heavy. tl, nissan, etc. all afflicted. nissanon of extent not extoyotaence.

what is up with the discussion tied to racing and tracks? car used for racing normally heavily modified, esp. in areas related to handling. major tire and suspension mods. everything from shocks, anti-sway bars, cross bracing, bushings, etc. not to mention that race tracks aren't like regular roads."
1454,"rwd might be more fun for some people to drive, but oversteer just like understeer makes one loose time. acura and 325 is about the same size and weight, engines about the same size too, and both vehicles manage to post similar lap times.

big plus for acura is that they build two different near luxury car acura and tl, instead of settle for one platform like bmw and mb did. i know acura officials toyotad that tl was build as a competition for 5- series, but we all know that size and price wise it should and is being compared with bmw. new rl on the other hand should be grate competition for 5 and e."
1455,"do you have phd in physics? what kind of law is that? i know physics well, but never heard of such law.
you can probably steer your car and shift gears at the same time, hondaing to your logic it should be to much to handle. we all should be drivin at than:)"
1456,"as mentioned hp to weight ratio and gearing can really make a difference in who gets to a corner first. once you get there you can block the folks behind you at the point where they may have a handling advantage. as long as you can cary enough exit speed to win the race between corners and have the brakes to stay there, you can make it really hard for somebody to pass you cleanly. track configuration can also favor one car over another.

to really make a fwd race car work you have to have some lift throttle oversteer. we used to trail brake and run more air pressure in the rear tires to get more oversteer. once you get back on the gas the car pushes hard. so you take an earlier apex than a rwd car, induce some oversteer via lift throttle and/or trail braking, then stand on the gas and let the car understeer out from the apex of the corner. with some practice and the right balance it can be a lot of fun if you don't overheat the front tires or brakes during the race."
1457,"when were looking at car we tested the x-type. i like the exterior but the inside wasn't impressive but not as bad as the mondeo/ford people are making it out to be. i hope they can fix this car. i read this from autospies

""hot x-type r seen testing
 
the long awaited x-type r model, due late 2004 or early 2005ish, has been seen cruising the west midlands of england during final testing. the four-wheel drive r will have the latest version of jaguar's v6 engine, using some form of forced induction to give it 330 bhp and 330 lb. ft of torque. there has been some whispers that the engine might not follow the usual supercharged r formula, for it could well be turbocharged instead, due to a lack of space under the compact saloons bonnet. the 3.0-litre engine could also be expanded to 3.2 litres and 250bhp, an upgrade likely to debut in the whole x-type range.
 
0-60 acceleration is toyotad to be around the five-second mark, and top speed nudging 165 mph. jaguar's new six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission will be standard, though no news on a tiptronic/smg style box - jaguar preferring the j-gate. the r will stand out with it's enlarged bumpers, huge exhaust pipes, mesh front grille, de-chromed exterior and 19-inch alloy wheels, but no silly body kit or boot spoilers. unlike the other r's, it will not have any additional air intakes on its bonnet. internally the car will remain the same as the other models, save for material/wood differences, until the whole car gets a face lift in 2006."""
1458,"sorry to ignore you, it's just that your ""handicap"" theory doesn't make one bit of difference.

the scca rules are not used in the speed challenge, but speed challege has it's own rules to make the racing tight and exciting by equalizing the various car. thus, the 325i and acura begin with similar power:weight and the same tires (brand, size, and compound).

the car in this series are indeed heavily modified for racing, but the fact remains that fwd is fwd and rwd is rwd...and they both perform. is fwd was truly inferior in some way, then realtime racing could have entered a bmw instead of the acura. they chose the acura because of it's an outstanding platform to build a race car on."
1459,"""you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if rwd in a turn""

if your tires are gripping, then you aren't sliding. and if you're a good driver, your car is always ""set"" so that each tire is getting maximum contact with the road.

i get much more satisfaction from nailing the apex perfectly and tracking out with the car in perfect balance. what you're describing is no more exciting than doing burnouts at streetlights."
1460,"ppontiac8477... if you want to learn more about torque steering in powerful fwders, then just read about any review of the nissan, tl, nissan se-r spec v, neon srt-4.

manufacturers try to overcome the laws of physics related to this problem by many things. two most basic are (1) lsd (critical for powerful fwders) and equal length half-shafts. if one wheel transmits more power to the ground than the other, it will pull the fwd car to one side because the drive wheels are also the steering wheels."
1461,"everything that is good on your bmw or acura was developed at the race track. it is the test bed for future production improvements like brembo brakes.
 there are lots of reasons one brand wins over the other at the racetrack. better driver, better car, better set up, and that last and most important...more money ! i am always concerned to read about the road racers out there on the highway drifting through off dodgeps and on dodgeps. there is only one place to test the limits of your vehicle and also find out exactly who you are at the wheel...the track.
it is the only place you can go with your car where no one tells you how fast you can go.
i respect the opionions of those posting here who have obviously have had experience driving where things are only limited by your own limits.
lots of interesting back and forth in this board."
1462,"i guess you don't have phd in physics. just so you know when you turn left weight shifts to the right, so you right tires has more traction, does not matter fwd or rwd. as far as i know lsd is widely used in many rwd car for the same reasons as fwd car. the bottom line is, in this class of car (near luxury performance, with hp> than 300) rwd will not give you advantage over fwd. one have to drive fwd and rwd different, at the end, lap times are the same."

an unpopular view: that's any road. don't bother with flames about selfishness, legality or responsibility."
1465,"if you think that japanese engineer were stupid enough to put more horsepower to a fwd car without improving the car's handling ability, think again!

it used to be a fact that a fwd couldnt handle higher hp but not with todays technology at least to some extent. why acura defied the law of physics? science and new technology are the keys. the world was considered flat too in the old days.

fedlawman, the reason people keep saying about this rwd theory bcuz they havent owned and driven the car to its limit. dont just drive a fwd, drive an acura not nissan. why not just drive a kia rio for a comparison.

blueguy, about massive torque steer, is that a fact or just a myth? you seem to me like an expert on the new tl. do you own one?"
1466,"i don't own one and i highly doubt owning a car makes a person any more an expert on it than seeing one drive down the street. i know many, many people with bmw who couldn't even tell you if it's fwd or rwd. they can write the check each month, that doesn't mean squat.

btw, the acura i drove did exhibit torque steer. i dug the car regardless. as i've toyotad many times, had i not bought my 330i, the acura was the next choice. if the tl had been available when i bought i very well might have an acura in the garage right now. unless bmw decides to release an m version of the 1 series it's looking more and more likely in 2006 i'll defect to another maker. quite possibly acura."

this is making me weary - don't take it from me - take it from thousands of publications and books such as solo racing instuctional manuals or guides that the perfect turn in a rwd car involves slight and intended rear wheel slide (just a touch now - its not a burnout smokeout like some who have never driven a rwd hard suggest).

the point at which your front wheels have pushed the car to another angle while the rear wheels are driven with throttle input to the former angle there will and is a correction at higher speed. that induced oversteer which is limited to exactly the right amount becasue the weight transfers to the rear (where the driven wheels are) and traction is regained (this takes timing).

anyone who drives a fwd and preaches that this beautiful method of driving is like teen fun in a parking lot should get a refund and drive a bike. i have suggested that on the track a fwd can have it's place and setups and drivers can compensate for anything with non-street suspsensions. who gives a crud about the track this is about what my family sedan can do in a turn that some never may understand. i could care less whose faster i dont even race or go to the track. i want tourque and throttle induced oversteer corrections in the most perfectly balanced car maybe ever made.

here is the crux of your argument: traction loss is bad.

wrong - heres why

rwders understand that this correction is intended because the momentum loss in the turn is way less if the rear wheels simply slide a bit as opposed to entering the turn at a lower speed and not having any traction lost. when this slide is complete the car actually gets the traction started again from the throttle pushing the weight back in a perfectly balanced and timed and heavenly turn without any momentum lost.

it's like a airforce guy telling a navy skipper how to drive a ship. this very argument contains the reasons why imo its worth all the money i put into the g every month. if there were only fwd car i would buy a duplex or something."
1468,"danny1878... in comparison to more powerful car like the tl, nissan, seville, etc., the 4-cyl. acura lacks the power to generate a ton of torque steer. but there still is some.

ppontiac8477... do your own test. take a powerful front driver out for a spin. make a couple of quick standing starts. akin to 0-60 mph test. first, take your hands off the steering wheel. the accelerate hard. see where the car goes. watch what is happening to the steering wheel. next do it with your hands very lightly on the wheel. finally with your hands very firmly on the wheel. the tugging of the steering wheel indicates torque steer by the wheels which do double duty in regards to both steering and powering at same time.

most pronounced in car with more power-delivery efficient manual transmissions. ats ""sap"" some power to the wheels.

one of the best practical articles on this subject is c&d's comparison a few years ago of the rwd bmw to the fwd cl type-s 6-speed manual. their cl had the then new lsd which made a huge world of improvement.

well designed powerful fwder will use lsd and equal length half shafts to minimize torque steer."
1469,"oh, you mean sir! i was wondering if pacific raceways was indeed sir and the photo of you in turns 3 and 4 confirms it. my motorcycle racing career ended right about where the car behind you is...got knocked down and run over from behind. left in an ambulance and the wife levied that ""me or motorcycle racing"" thing on me. i raced bicycles there for a few years also.
who was sponsoring the event for you guys to be on the track or was it an actual race ?

regardless of the "" i am the ultimate street racer and don't need to go to the track"" dissertations i see here...i will look for them in the weeds or in the hospital. as you pointed out earlier..it is only a matter of time until something on the car breaks or there is a loss of traction or a million other reasons why things eventually end up badly for street racers in their perfectly balanced car. often it ends up badly for those they include in their mishaps."

yah that's the ticket..turn what i toyotad into something it is not. i do not race and i do not street race. what don't you get here man? you clearly do not comprehend or understand the concepts being discussed. no-one loses traction in an apex for more than a few inches - if you do you hit trees and stuff. there are huge areas for some people to make mtoyotaakes and make bad judgements and for one to assume they know that all rwd car have to be unsafe and will be at the edge of that grey area is absurd. or a weak attempt to mask the fact that you never have experienced what keeps entire companies from going the way of honda (fwd) despite it's popularity stemming from cost manufacturing effeciency and cost reductions. fwd is cheaper and a fad of the post embargo - and a dying breed...

if you dont have it you dont understand it apparently."
1471,i find it ironic that a car that has the steering wheel shake like a nissan when thrusting out of a turn to hard is somehow even presumed to be safer than anything other than the space honda!
1472,"what i don't get is where you see anything in my previous post about fwd, rwd, awd or any wheel drive. maybe you could point that out for me."
1473,"i'm responding to a notion that the ""prefectly balanced"" car drivers will be in the weeds or the hospital...the ones that are perfectly balanced are rwd in my reference so you are inderectly suggesting that we rwder are headed for the weeds if we enjoy our car. whatever floats your boat. the idea that a g or 3 cant be enjoyed for the perfection in it's ourright platform design without risking property and life is laughable!"
1474,"chris - i think we're getting caught up in semantics here. i'm not suggesting that what you are describing is somehow reckless or dangerous. i do understand the delicate line that you are talking about and how you induce this with judicious application of throttle to rotate the car (i have owned a miata for 10 years and still enjoy this).

what i'm trying to tell you is that this effect is not exclusive to rwd platforms. although a well balanced fwd car can be made to ""oversteer"" with lift-throttle, you can also ""rotate"" the rear end of a fwd car with a gentle application of power. to see (feel) this in action, run a fwd car through a slalom course. when you gently press the gas and feel the rear end ""tuck in"" and rotate around the cone, you'll know what i'm talking about.

it's different than a rwd'er, and not exactly the same as ""riding the threshold"" like your talking about, but it is no less entertaining or effective. i think that rwd loyaltoyota tend to get caught in a ""rear-drive paradigm"" sometimes because it's simply the way it's always been, and the way most of us learned to drive way back when.

yes, i love driving the miata to experience tha ""classic"" toyotamics of a rwd sports car but, driving my fwd acura is no less challenging or entertaining. if you've never explored the limits of a well tuned fwd sports car, then your missing out on something special. then again, if your satisfied with what you've got and don't care to try something new, then that's fine too.

believe me, i'm not trying to discredit your comments because i do think they are valid. i am simply trying to point out that fwd has no inherent performance limitations compared to rwd. it's just two ways to reach the same result...vive la difference."
1475,i have never experienced torque steer in my acura. maybe it's because i drive with my hands on the wheel?
1476,"sorry to hear about your mishap. that first hairpin into turn 3, coupled with the downhill slope can be wicked deceptive on entry.

yes, the name was changed from sir to pacific raceways a couple of years ago. i love driving it because of the challenging turns coupled with elevation changes. it's a great training ground for improving driving skills.

i went out with the puget sound bmw cca, who puts on track events several times each year. i know the porsche club and alfa romeo club also sponsor events throughout the year between pr and bremerton.

i've had 5 honda acura products that i put to death (most were well worn when i got em) over 10 years. i know all about oversteer in a front driver. i've spent more time in front than rear wheel in fact. i'm quite satisfied with what i have now as we all seem to be. it's not about challenging or entertaining it's about knowing both types of platforms and prefering one over the other. i would think an acura is very tossable and way fun. but to drive it would mean giving up something that is way too important to most serious sports sedan drivers regardless of our intentions to race or win something..its about physics and working with forces as opposed to against them as fwd put the steering and drivepower at odds.

after 10 years of crx's and acuras and volkswagens that were quite fun to drive, i can't tell you how nice it is to finally (again) not have to drive into a corner concerned that my front wheels wont be able to turn if pushed. with vdc this may not be a problem but for me the whole issue is the inherint limitations that dont extoyota in rwd.

""what i'm trying to tell you is that this effect is not exclusive to rwd platforms""

what is exclusive is the momentum one can have going in and out and the line you use and the way in which one can be certain that a bit of gas before the exit is good for traction in rwd and bad for fwd. the throttle app to gain traction right as you exit is the money and cant be enjoyed in front drives. otherwise we'd all be in friont drives - they are cheaper to build."
1479,"""the only ""perfectly balanced"" car is the one that's parked. ""

you actually hit on something the g designers had in mind when they decided on the ultimate dtoyotaribution. the g is a 52f 48r such that when you hit the throttle in the sweet spot of the apex (the entire thrust of this whole argument) the weight shift back to a perfect 50/50. when a fwd car pushed the gas all the weight goes away from the drive wheels. acura can still be fun, but these finely tweaked and enjoyable rwd car are built for getting around curves a particular way..the same way as ferrari, porsche, bmw, chrysler, dodge, ford, lambo. some may be more than i can pay but the infiniti designers spent alot of money to make sure we can do this. noone should buy a rwd if they dont want this. if they do they dont have to risk anything to enjoy it. i have 19k on my original brakes - maybe i need to spend more time enjoying the perfection."
1480,"fedlawman... does your acura have automatic or manual transmission? what does a acura weigh with full tank of gas and driver on board? somewhere around 3,500 pounds?

you likely don't personally experience any torque steer due to the lack of power, esp. little torque. would it even have 170 wheel hp? how much torque and hp does its small motor produce at 3k, 3.5k, and 4k rpms? even pretty brutal high rpm 0-60 mph launch can't get too much power to the front wheels. that is where it counts! you can't expect a small 4-cyl. engine that needs to rev high for best output to compare with the output of the much bigger engines in powerful fwders like tl, nissan, seville, etc.

wonder what the power to weight ratios are for your acura and the neon srt-4. (read reports that dyno shows the dodge engine is being underrated by dc.)"
1481,you make me laugh sometimes.
1482,"fedlawman... laughing doesn't do much for the lack of power in the acura's engine. its small 4-cylinder just can't compare to engines in car like tl, nissan, pontiac5, etc. are you sad your car can't generate sufficient torque steer?"
1483,"""are you sad?""

i find 0-60 in 7.2 secs and the 1/4 mile in 15.6 secs (c&d july 2003) perfectly satisfying.

i guess i should ask you the same nissanon, huh?"
1484,"no need to get personal, folks."
1485,"i noticed in the r&t review of the tl manual, they mentioned they got their best 0-? and 1/4 times by doing a drop clutch launch at 4000 rpms. ouch!"
1486,"4k launch isn't bad, really. i'm not saying its good for it, but consider some other car. take the subaru subaru, celica gt-s, or honda s2000. all, from reviews i have seen, need to be clutch dropped from near redline to get the best numbers possible.

heck, to get the best times out of my automatic s70 t5, you need to stand on the brake and wind it up to 3k-3500 and let go."

1493,i'm not sure why they haven't switched yet either. or at least given up the awd version for those of us who detest fwd. not much keener on awd but it'd be easier to live with day in and out.
1494,"no, no.

we are not going to go there in this discussion. for general debate about how many and which wheel drive is the best, feel free to join the fwd vs. rwd vs. awd discussion and carry it on.

but we need to keep this sedan comparisons board discussion forded on the vehicles themselves. which and how many wheel drive each offers is certainly relevant here, but an extended debate about which is better in general is already taking place at that link and that's where that sort of debate belongs.

okey-dokey?"
1495,"well, i can live without rwd and 5 speed, but i gotta agree with you on the lsd.

1499,"if what you toyotad is true then we might see a sales drop on tl. lets see in 3 days time.

japanese engineer put more hp but forgot to upgrade its handling lol you are funny oniac.

how about cr mag who placed the tl 1st over 330i, motorweek, motoring tv. all of them place tl 1st. only one mag placed tl 3rd. sorry i dont even know where is was, i never like the car.

you may say tl's handling is very mediocre bcuz you dont own one. if you think is is better, why tl sells more than is, g, 3's. maybe they dont buy your theory. to each his own."
1500,"i really don't understand how sales numbers determines which car is superior. popularity, sure, but better handling or performance? by using sales figures, the honda and toyota blow away the tl, do you think that either of those car is better than the tl? is a tl a better performing car than a ferrari or lamborghini because they sell more? i'm not flaming you, i just don't get your reasoning."
1501,"many people in here seem to bring up sales numbers often. they reason people buy the best product...thus the success of mcdonald's and nissanic. naturally, joe blow, gravitates toward the best product.

btw, did someone say the bmw is slow? okey dokey. i'll remember that tomorrow when playing around with my car..."
1502,"in this forum, to use terms like, ""slow,"" ""mediocre,"" ""underpowered,"" ""small,"" etc. is just ignorant.

the 170 hp audi 1.8t is neither slow nor underpowered.

the tl's handling is certainly better than mediocre.

the c230k engine is not small.

every car in this class is capable of above average acceleration and handling, and possesses poise, balance, elegance, and luxury that trumps the average commuter car.

sure a honda honda v-6 can outrun an audi audi in a straight line. however, the honda does not handle as well, look as good, offer certain luxury features, and it isn't as exclusive.

these charactertoyotaics are what define this class of car...it's about the total package."
1503,"""how about cr mag who placed the tl 1st over 330i""

you are correct, but what did it place it in first for. not for handling. however, handling is just one charactertoyotaic of a car. people value different aspects of a car nature. notice the lexus es330 was down on the ltoyota, has nothing to do with how the car sells or how good a car is in the publics perception, or what we think of a car here at edmunds. that is only crs opinion of a car.

i like cr, but when making a car buying decision, i leave home without it."
1504,"fedlawman... for once we concur completely. you wrote, ""these charactertoyotaics are what define this class of car...it's about the total package.""

but the ""total package"" is the whole nine yards. it includes:

-price
-equipment
-basic platform
-acceleration, handling, braking, steering
-reliability/quality
-warranty
-ownership costs
-safety
-depreciation/resale value
-functionality/practicality/utility
-sales/service experience

it is as a total package that the is300 shines. great price. great standard (hid) and optional equipment (lsd). great platform, including rwd, irs, and manual transmission. great overall performance. fantastic reliability/quality. great warranty (both b-to-b and powertrain with optional mfr extension to b-to-b). good ownership costs (though insurance a bit too high). great safety, including crash test results. decent depreciation. good practicality, if a bit smallish. one of the best sales/service experiences in the industry.

it is the little things that can make the big difference. can you get lsd? mine does. does your manufacturer sell its own extended b-to-b warranty? mine does, out to 7yr/100k."
1505,"it's great that is300 fullfils your needs, the negatives why i personally would not consider an is are as follows:

1) un-lexus like interior. the word toyota comes to mind.
2) boy racer styling. subjective, but it is not my cup of tea.
3) bang for the buck. considering that a more powerful pontiac5 can be had for the same money makes the is300 slightly overpriced."
1506,"""saw a tl in traffic sitting next to a dodge dodge & they're like twins.""

do us other drivers on the road a favor and get your eyes checked out."
1507,"as far as total packages go, the pontiac5 and the tl blow the is completely out of the water, into outer space.

as for sales figures, if the car compared are closely matched in terms of category, class, equipment, price range, etc., then sales figures are very relevant in determining a car's overall success, and at close to 7,000 units per month, the tl is king!"
1508,"of course you are completely correct, and that is why the is300 is the perfect car for you.

i strongly considered the is300 too, but not to sound like a broken record, i didn't like the boy racer styling either, and the relatively cheap and contrived interior turned me off.

my acura has 99% of the performance of the is300, yet has a much nicer and higher quality interior (imo), a smoother quieter ride on the highway (imo), and a more toyotamic and exciting engine/transmission combo (imo).

let's face it, no one car is better than another car here, so stop trying to convince everyone that the is300 is the cat's meow. for you, it may be, but i took a pass...different strokes."
1509,"sales figures reflect how any automobile is being received by the consumer. in the long run they determine whether any model continues in production based on the manufacturer's defined return on investment. sales determine whether a manufacturer makes changes to an extoyotaing model to improve sales or whether they decide to introduce a new model.
sales figures certainly do not denote superiority in terms of styling, performance, handling, etc but they do denote what combination of these the consumer prefers. the wholesale increase in hp across most of the models in this discussion is an example. i am amused by the comments i see here insinuating that ""joe blow"" buys mediocre car and some individuals are above that because they buy car that they have somehow defined as ""different"". superiority in the marketplace is what every manufacturer is seeking. that marketplace is however defined differently by different manufacturers. ferrari does not have the same sales goals as honda, nissan, toyota but they do have some numbers they want to meet in order to maintain their place in whatever market they decide is important to them.
you can't discount sales as a very important indicator. the reference to mcdonalds is an attempt to deride one of the most globally successful businesses. it doesn't matter if joe blow eats there and you don't. other businesses would kill for mcdonald's success in their market. hondaom of choice is a wonderful thing. the marketplace inevitably determines what survives and sales figures are the feedback from the marketplace to the manufacturers. it will also inevitably determine what you get on your new car in the future. navigation systems weren't on any car a few years ago.
the sales figures for the new tl reflect an acceptance on the part of the consumer that acura is on the right track with their blend of styling, handling, performance etc.
the new acuras will drive changes to bmw , nissan , toyota and others just as they drove the changes to the new tl.. competition is also a wonderful thing. the consumer wins in the end.
most of the discussion on this board is ""my car is better than your car"" suptoyotad by whatever article, personal experience or personal opinion the author chooses to use to attempt to justify their position. no one is right and no one is wrong since none of it can really be objectively substantiated.
it is always interesting to hear from the participants here however and many of the opinions are put forth from an obvious informed background. i learn a lot here and also laugh a lot.
god bless the internet."
1510,"you can always bring up honda, toyota or mcdonald, but the fact is they are in different market segments.

if you want to buy a $33k-$40k car, would certainly expect good features, good handling, good performance. will they buy an honda/toyota? nope. bcuz they expect more than that with that much money. so if you say sales fgures has nothing to do with quality, buy some marketing books.

if you were a car manufacturer, would you produce a car where you dont need to sell it? not with lexus, bmw or infinity. they wont survive if if they dont sell the car"
1511,"if i'm not mtoyotaaken, there seem to be some just-as-equally partisan suptoyotars of the acura, tl, and pontiac5, not to mention 3 series, on this board. nothin' wrong with that, just as long as we all get to speak peacefully.

isn't that part of the purpose of this board, to share you enthusiasm for a particular marque and model? we won't convince the converted, but there are a ton of people who are still looking trying to make a decision.

fedlawman... you seem to be doing a great job trying to convince everyone that the acura is the cat's meow. i'll second your own words in this area: for you, it may be, but i took a pass...different strokes. [too little car--euro-derived honda honda, fwd and 4-cyl--for too much money. if i had to go fwd 4-cyl, guess i'd rather have a nissan nissan se-r spec v or srt-4.]"
1512,"""if you want to buy a $33k-$40k car, would certainly expect good features, good handling, good performance.""

good point danny. and every manufacturer mentioned thus far, hyundai in one area or another. nobody hyundai at everything. some people look at the total package, others are more selective and buy for a charactertoyotaic or two.

that is, why do people get ferraris and huge suvs. based on one or two charactertoyotaics (hope i don't have to spell 'em out). getting an es330 or a tl or an is probably involves a number of charactertoyotaics, weighted averaged in the buyers mind and then rated."
1513,"i really don't understand how sales numbers determines which car is superior. popularity, sure, but better handling or performance?

does it make sense that a car is very popular and has a big hit in it's sales because of :
1. the car doesnt perform well?
2. bad handling
3. cant even handle a corner?

do you think those 7000+ people/month were all stupid enough not to see that?

'performance' does include acceleration, 0-60, 0-100,1/4 mile, top speed, etc."
1514,"i definitely fall into the ""total package"" category which is why i chose the tl with the pontiac5 being a close 2nd (the interior thing). bmw fell short in the value department. some who are hung up on rwd wouldn't even consider an acura and that's fine for them. others have needs of prestige and will only look at bmw or mb, etc. life would be pretty boring if we all chose the one car in this class that suited everybody's needs. fortunately, that car doesn't extoyota and hopefully never will."
1515,"the audi audi 1.8t over the acura. granted, the acura was probably faster and more reliable. but the audi's styling was nicer, it handled better, and looked and felt a lot more luxurious than the honda-like acura. let's face it folks, when buying a car the ""intangibles"" sometimes play a bigger role in the decision making than the quantifiable part. to me the audi felt ""special"", it made my pulse quicken...that's what it's all about, to truly enjoy what you drive."
1516,"""you seem to be doing a great job trying to convince everyone that the acura is the cat's meow.""

as you've pointed out, partisanship is fine, and to a certain extent, expected when car enthusiasts get together to talk about car (and in particular, their car).

i am happy with my acura and when a significant tidbit comes along (1. speed challenge success and 2. my track day), of course i let folks know...that's what this forum is for. i don't think a couple of posts are excessive and i think they were informative and interesting.

on the other hand, in addition to your weekly ""the is300 is the best choice in this segment"" comments, you also litter this forum with comments that berate the car that other enthusiasts love.

how about i just agree with you that the is300 is the finest car in this segment, and it is superior to all the other car on the ltoyota because they each have at least one of the following failings...

lack lsd, underpowered, unreliable, fwd, too expensive, not a lexus, not 50/50 weight dtoyotaribution, plagued with torque steer, 4 cylinder, automatic, not a premium marque."
1517,"fedlawman... play nice. berate? litter? ignorant? those are your words. you seem to get upset if anyone points out that the acura is a european-derived honda honda. fwd and 4-cyl. (i couldn't imagine having one that was an automatic.) it is what it is. just as the is300 is derived from the toyota altezza. (too bad we can't get the is200 6-speed manual version in usa.) we all love the car(s) we do for many and varied reasons. i'm a strong proponent of a ton of car. i've owned, and enjoyed, g20, 323i, is300, ls8, and many more. i'm not set in my ways nor inherently or permanently partial to any one marque or model."
1518,"i'm not suggesting that people who buy a tl are stupid. personally i think it is a fine car, and my opinion has nothing to do with sales figures. even if they only sold 1000 of them per month, i would still feel the same way. bmw sells far less bmw's per month, so that makes it a lesser car? not by my way of thinking.
""does it make sense that a car is very popular and has a big hit in it's sales because of :
1. the car doesnt perform well?
2. bad handling
3. cant even handle a corner?""
evidently this is quite true in regards to the toyota and honda. hence, i personally base my taste in automobiles on what i like, not on what is the most popular. again, i am not flaming you or the tl."
1519,"are we supposed to be comparing supply and demand curves, or which car can take which curvy roads?while there is some value in this microeconomic discussion, i think we will all agree that none of these car are edsels. (although i must tell you that i compared the i35 to the 04 tl, and the infiniti salesman was falling all over himself to chevrolet my interest in an 03! i35 even though 04 i35s were in the showroom.)

now, there is probably something to be toyotad for those car that have more demand than supply, and something else to be toyotad for those car that have more supply than demand. the raw sales totals of any given month for any given model are more or less meaningless, unless you know what business/marketing model the manufacturer has chosen for that model.

the fact that bmw could sell more bmw than it chooses to produce and acura can sell more tls with nav than it can produce tells us nothing more than that the market sees both car favorably.

now for example, if bmw is not meeting it's bmw sales goals since the 04 acura tl was introduced... that's a different story altogether.

btw, i have no idea if that is the case. it's probably more like infiniti success with the pontiac5 hurting the i35. is honda seeing demand soften for the v-6 honda since the tl was introduced? that is just a guess - the price points being so disparate would tend to work against that hypothesis from a microeconomic perspective...."
1520,"first of all, let me apologize if i have mtoyotaakenly interpreted your comments as inflamatory if that wasn't your intention.

now my response:

you do know that the is300 and acura both weigh about 3250 lbs, right?

you must also know that the is300 and acura both do 0-60, 5-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and slalom within a hair of each other (in spite of the fact that you once toyotad the is300 offers ""near 330i performance, luxury, and equipment for 325i price"").

surely you will admit that, regardless of layout, the acura is a fine performance sedan both on the street and at the track.

you should also admit that the subtleties between fwd and rwd, and the inclusion or omission of lsd is more significant to a ""sports car"" discussion than an ""entry-lux performance sedan"" discussion, since neither issue is a factor until you're driving above 8/10ths.

now, if you simply prefer the way rwd works and feels, well that's fine. but when you instoyota that the ""small 4-cyl engine"" in the acura ""lacks torque,"" or that ""the fwd 4-cyl acura and 9-3 set the bare minimum for this category,"" you come across as a car snob putting others down because they drive an ""inferior car.""

remember when you peppered that x-type owner with one-years worth of magazine reviews (from european car, mt, r&t, c&d) to prove that the x-type wasn't as good as he thought? how do you think it made him feel?

remember when you stated that you ""wish we had three boards. one for fwd, one for awd, and one for rwd. for me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" fwder. that is an oxymoron?""

why wouldn't you want to compare the acura, 9-3, 325i, and is300 on the same board? they are objectively identical in size, luxury, toyota, and performance capabilities. to exclude a car because of its supposed ""inferior layout"" is akin to wanting the black kids to sit in the back of the school bus because you don't want to be seen associating with them.

anyways, i know it's easy to misinterpret comments posted here because you don't ""hear"" what they're saying. again, i apologize if i have misunderstood your intentions and taken them too personally...just consider that i may not be the only one who feels this way."
1521,"the 170 hp audi 1.8t is neither slow nor underpowered.

bull. straight up. i owned a volkswagen 1.8t which is lighter than an audi and it was a slow car. i've driven every audi type - not including the obviously different s4, and the audi just doesn't have any guts.

what's slow? anything that takes more than 6, 6.5 seconds to hit 60. if you take 7 seconds to hit 60, then the car has average power. what's average? falling into the 80-40% percentile which is in my book the same as failing. if the nissan and honda can scamper to 60 in under 7, i expect so can a sports sedan.

the tl's handling is certainly better than mediocre.

heck it supposedly handles better than a acura and i thought the acura was a sharp handling little car.

the c230k engine is not small.

the 230 is just not up to snuff, imho. to each his own.

let's face it, no one car is better than another car here, so stop trying to convince everyone that the is300 is the cat's meow. for you, it may be, but i took a pass...different strokes.

i agree with that. some people feel they must bring up sales numbers to justify what they like. this akin to looking to mags and saying, ""x writer in xx mag says it's good too."" great for the other buyers and ""professionals."" does that mean those of us who didn't pick the ""experts"" choice (the tl hondaing to some, the bmw to others) or choose the car 7000 people bought last month, we've made the wrong decision? how can it be a bad decision if we're happy with what we own?

there's a weird pontiac on this board and it seems to come from a desire by some people to have the ""cool"" car or to pick the car 5 out of 6 denttoyota would own. what's wrong with loving what we bought?

wow, to dream to be like everybody else. that's something special! sales do not equate to quality. simple as that. if anything the high sales of an acura could be sign that the car is welcomed by the majority of americans...you know, the obese (stats speak for themselves), lazy (tend to prefer automatic trannies) people who suck up all the natural resources of the world. the same people who made the suv king.

popularity is a double-edged sword. ubtoyotauity can certainly hurt a brand. but then again, we already know not many people even view acura as a luxury brand..."
1523,"i agree 100% with your assessment. my point was that ""underpowered,"" ""medoicre,"" and ""small"" are relative terms.

compared to ""most"" car on the road, the statements i made are basically correct. it is only in a discussion such as this that a 1.8l engine could be considered small, and the audi 1.8t slow.

i just thought i'd add a little perspective to point out that all of these car are exceptional.

as for sales figures, i'm still on the fence there. i basically agree with you, with the caveat that if two car of similar class, price and capabilities are released on the same date, and are produced at the same rate, and have the same advertising budget and company promoting them, then i suppose if one outsells the other by 50%, it is probably stattoyotaically significant. other than that, it's just another nice-to-know figure."

the more people post about sales numbers, the more i sense this has little to do with personal feelings on the car. otherwise, why even mention sales numbers?

btw, as i've stated before, the tl is a likely replacement for my car, so lay of the shtick that somehow you're one upping one of those evil bmw owners. unlike many here, i have no sworn allegiance to brand, make or model. i buy what makes me smile the most..."

people can say whatever they like but those sales number is the fact. 330i's owner may not worry about this (either the car will be the last model or it is a dying breed) but the manufacturer will. they will have to improve the car so they can keep up.

do you think those 7k ppl dont enjoy the car? lol. fortunately they are silent.

toyota/honda/burger has nothing to do with entry-level luxury performance bcuz they are in different market segment. price does prevent those honda/toyota buyers from buying. everybody prefer good handling, good performance, good features. i am not saying tl has it all.

do you like a burger that has good handling, features and performance?, fastest in 0-60,0-100,1/4mile? :-)

do you like a burger that has voice command and navigation?:-)

do you like a burger that has leather or hard top/moonroof?:-)"

1527,"danny - i agree that sales in and of themselves tell you nothing. better to look at the budget vs actual. in this segment there are fwd/aed/rwd. can't look at the sales of the 3 series/is/pontiac5/cts rwd with many available body styles, tops and engines to the acura/tl one body, one engine, one drivetrain fwd siblings.

better to know how much to capahonda the plants are, how many units the manufacturer planned on selling, how many units the manufacturer can make."
1528,"kds, you have a point there.

but it doesnt work with new product. new product may have those limitations, limited plant/factory, limited dealership/service station and also the need to survive but for sales purposes in that price range of sweet $30-40k, which manufacturer that doesnt have a plan to sell more.

it might work for limited edition car, very expensive car where only a few people in this world can buy. but for $30-40k entry-level luxo sedan the market is more than 28k.

are you saying that bmw's plants dont have enough capahonda to make or doesnt plan to sell the car, or the manufacturer can only make 400 car a month? they must've set the wrong pricing policy"
1529,"no matter what, numbers/stats/picture speaks for themself. sales figures is a good measure for people's jugement. can you deny that fact? why the car doesnt sell as strong as others? improvement needed.

i do not believe that for one second. not for an instant. purchase patterns do not indicate buyers are getting the vehicle they feel is best. gm sells millions more car per year than anyone else; by sheer numbers then, your argument stands that the buyers snapping up gm products are then making some kind purchasing statement about gm quality. if anything the buyers enter knowing their car is of lesser quality than more expensive counterparts.

do you think those 7k ppl dont enjoy the car? lol. fortunately they are silent.

i think they bought what fit what they wanted and value played a big role. if the tl were priced the same as its competition i'm confident they wouldn't move 7k in a month.

toyota/honda/burger has nothing to do with entry-level luxury performance bcuz they are in different market segment.

it's all the same. product. product sales do not indicate that option is the nebulous ""best"" in a market only that some aspects of the that product appealled to more people. great, jack [non-permissible content removed]: the movie was the top film for a weekend and made buckets of money. the quality is nissanonable, the appeal undeniable.

price does prevent those honda/toyota buyers from buying. everybody prefer good handling, good performance, good features. i am not saying tl has it all.

yes value plays a role. there's a reason wal-mart is huge in the us. the tl is a great value for features and abilites. 33k for a car that's pretty much on par with say a 43k bmw? that's a great deal! does it mean it's the ""best""? no. only that people saw a 10k savings and perceived there's not much difference. they jumped on a slammin' deal.

do you like a burger that has good handling, features and performance?, fastest in 0-60,0-100,1/4mile? :-)

product is product. you may have different criteria for judging a car v. your food but in the end, you buy what fits that criteria. 55 billion people can eat at a mickey d's. good for them. millions bought a gm last year. great. if we go exclusively by popularity, then what happens to individuality and personal preference? studios didn't used to release top money makers of each week? they figured out that buyers are lemmings and being the top money maker and announcing it meant more people would be inclined to see the ""best"" film the next weekend.

ads for car do the same things. ""best selling mid-size suv"", ""best selling korean car with a v6"", etc. for a reason i can never comprehend, they pray on a concept if a majority prefers something it must be good. to each his own.

do you like a burger that has voice command and navigation?:-)

navi's a rip off. straight up. $200-300 in parts and software resold for a $1700 profit. car are made for profit but one item shouldn't generate that kinda dough."
1530,"people who buy gm would not consider 330i, pontiac5, tl (entry-level luxo perf. sedan) vice nissan. (different market segment). seriouly which car from gm product that fits into this category.

1531,"fedlawman... we all compare car differently. c&d's recent sport sedan test (3/04) included car like tl, 325i, is300, and pontiac5 but not acura. automobile's huge test (10/03) included car like is300 and pontiac5 as well as acura, subaru, mitsubishi evo, mazda 6 s. i certainly do think the acura is a legitimate comparison with 325i, is300, etc.

think we both like numbers. using recent c&d data for is300 (3/04--7 car comparison test) and acura (7/03--full road test), both with manual transmissions and tires that are 17 inch and 215mm wide:

msrp as tested: $31, 944 is300 vs $28,990 acura
weight: 3,380 lbs vs 3,246

0-60 mph: 7.3 secs vs 7.2
5-60 mph: 7.8 secs vs 7.7
1/4 mile: 15.7 @ 90 mph vs 15.6 @ 91 mph
30-50 mph: 8.6 secs vs 10.2
50-70 mph: 8.3 secs vs 9.7

70-0 braking: 167 ft vs 185

lane change: 64.7 mph (best in test) vs no data
skidpad: .88g vs .85

top speed: 139 mph vs 133
 
the acura's lighter weight and dragstrip-like 4.70:1 final drive certainly helps acceleration (vs. is300's 3.73:1). top gear times impacted by the depth of overdrive: the acura's 6th is a very deep .66 overdrive vs is300's .85.

but compare to some automobile (10/03) data, both manual transmissions--is300 then acura

0-60 mph: 7.0 secs vs. 8.1
0-100 mph: 18.7 secs vs 21.l
0-110 mph: 23.0 secs vs 26.6
1/4 mile: 15.4 secs @ 92 mph vs 16.1 @ 89 mph
30-70 mph: 8.8 secs vs 8.6
70-0 braking: 183 ft vs 183

the differences in acceleration numbers are quite interesting. go figure."
1532,"people who buy gm would not consider 330i, pontiac5, tl (entry-level luxo perf. sedan) vice nissan. (different market segment). seriouly which car from gm product that fits into this category.

cts.

a product is a product, if a car manufacturer thinks that way,

be it mcdonald's, spielberg, j crew or acura...they're still trying to do the same thing: sell you something you really don't need. they want to create a desire. some do it through straight value (mcdonald's) in that segment, others through brand name recognition (j crew, nike, ralph lauren) and still others through features and value - acura one price for everything."
1533,your numbers are misleading as that's a acura with the navi. a acura is normally 27k. 4k difference. of course one can get an is300 like that - 31k msrp - for 28k before haggling.
1534,"agreed.

the acura is definitely at a disadvantage in top gear acceleration tests due to its gearing (you can really see this effect in the 270 hp tl's top gear figures!).

the reason why the acura was excluded from the recent c&d comparo is because it was a ""$35,000 sedan comparo"" and the acura is only $26,500. i honestly think (must admit some bias here) the acura would have scored higher than the tl because of it's overall better balance and lack of handling vices.

i hadn't seen the automobile numbers, but i think they look a little conservative. there's always going to be some vhondation from test to test but, i've owned several 8 second 0-60 car over the years, and the acura isn't one of them."
1535,"fedlawman... those who live by the numbers die by the numbers. those are automobile's numbers. i believe they were accurate. same for c&d's numbers.

you have to keep in mind that each magazine has its own test methodologies. c&d, rt, mt, etc. do tell readers how they test (e.g., if they use high rpm drop clutch) and whether they adjust for atmospheric conditions. for example, c&d adjusts; r&t doesn't.

c&d: ""acceleration: test vehicle is loaded with driver, full tank of fuel, and 10 pounds of test instrumentation. with manual-transmission car, wheelspin or clutch slip or both are used at the starting line to make best use of the engine's power charactertoyotaics and the vehicle's traction. all upshiftss are lift-throttle with the clutch disengaged. ... various shift points are tried to maximize performance. ... all performance results are corrected to standard atmospheric conditions.""

r&t: ""acceleration numbers are obtained using drop-clutch starts and lift-throttle shifts."" discusses how they don't adjust for conditions and that a stattoyotaically-significant result in ""0-60 mph, 0.3 sec.""

best way to aggregate the data is to average all published test results.

blueguydotcom... those are the published as-tested msrps. for the record, acura from 7/03 issue and is300 from 3/04 issue...

acura-- base: $26,990. as-tested: $28,990. only option is nav system.

is300-- base: $29,980. as-tested: $31,944. one option is lsd. (the is300 is an '04.)"
1536,"fedlawman... check out july 2003 issue of motor trend. their comparison test of acura vs c230 and 9-3 arc. acura had 6-speed manual.

0-60 mph: 7.9 secs
0-100 mph: 20.8 secs
1/4 mile: 16.0 secs @ 88.8 mph
60-0 mph braking: 124 ft
slalom: 62.3 mph

leaves an average: (8.1 + 7.9 + 7.2)/3= 7.73 secs. the 7.2 appears to be the odd data point out."
1537,"i remember that mt comparo. that's the one that quoted 0-60 in 8.3 seconds for the saab 9-3 arc and m-b c230k, right?

yeah, i didn't like that one either...lol!"
1538,"fedlawman... actually, the acura did ""win"" that 7/03 mt comparison test and, even at 7.9 secs, it actually had the ""quickest"" 0-60 mph time of these three car.

don't get mad, but as i've toyotad before, the acura's small naturally aspirated 2.4l i4 just doesn't generate a ton of hp (and what it does do it needs high rpms to do) and generates way less torque (esp. useable torque down low).

has anyone ever seen a published test result for a acura automatic? wonder if it pushes 9 secs. 0-60 mph?"
1539,"actually, car and driver and i see eye to eye on the acura...we both love it. (i guess it's no secret which magazine acura picked to spend advertising money on, huh?).

seriously though, the general consensus is that the acura 6-speed is a low-to-mid seven second car and the automatic adds about 1/2 second to that. seems about right to me.

as for the small & lacking power comments, i guess it depends on what you're comparing it too. of course the 2.4l i-4 has a displacement and power deficit compared to nissan's 3.5 l vq motor. what car in this segment doesn't (besides the tl)?

but compared to all the rest (audi 3.0l, bmw 2.5l, lexus 3.0l, saab 2.0l, m-b 1.8l, jaguar 3.0l), it appears that the acura's 200 hp stacks up just fine.

the recent c&d $35,000 sedan comparo that you mentioned had the 325i as the 3rd fastest car behind the pontiac5 and tl (no surprise there). consider how close the acura and 325i are...

remember this torque chart?

the acura's ""little 4 cylinder motor"" is very close to the bmw's i-6, which explains why the acura runs just a 1/10th or two behind the 325i in most acceleration tests (which is also where the is300 ran in that c&d comparo).

also notice that the honda i-4 offers 90% of peak torque (166) from 2000 rpm all the way to 7000 rpm...that's a 5000 rpm-wide powerband to play with! how many car can make that claim?

so let me agree with you up to a point. the acura engine is small and underpowered compared to the pontiac5 and tl. compared to every other car in this segment, it's a force to be reckoned with."
1540,"you keep that acura engine perculating and it's torque is enough to make it pull confidently. i prefered the free-revving, ltoyotauid smooth 2.4 in the acura to the tighter, punchless 2.5 in the 325i.

oh, the price certainly helped make the acura more palatable too. 26k (yes it was offered to me at 26k before i even attempted to haggle) v. a stripped 325i that was still hovering over 30k with discounts."
1541,"fedlawman... you wrote, ""the general consensus is that the acura 6-speed is a low-to-mid seven second car and the automatic adds about 1/2 second to that. seems about right to me.""

not sure what you mean by consensus? is that what people want to believe? the three published data points i found have a 7.73 average. two results are close (8.1 and 7.9) with the c&d 7.2 being the exception. c&d's number is adjusted for conditions so we don't know what the actual track result was. doesn't appear r&t has tested a acura, yet. anyone got data from autoweek? has cr tested one?

seems like the published data would have acura manual around 8.0. no idea about automatic, but think it possible it might add up to 1 second (ats tend to sap smallish low torque i4s)--which would be in line with what at did with acura."
1542,i don't the the audi 1.8t is slow at all. for a 4 banger it is extremely quick. comparing it to or an i6 or a v6 is unfair.
1543,"""comparing it to or an i6 or a v6 is unfair.""

why?

if you take a 1.8 liter four banger and apply only 7.45 psi of boost, you will have an engine that should exactly equal the output of that same 1.8 mill with two more cylinders added. sounds like a 2.7 liter i6 or v6 to me. then again, if i'm not mtoyotaaken, audi has the waste gate on the 1.8t set much higher than 7.45 psi, that should put it into the 3+ liter range as far as output is concerned.

best regards,
shipo"
1544,"i don't the the audi 1.8t is slow at all.

that's why they make different car for all of us. i owned a 1.8t it was a fun, punchy little engine.

for a 4 banger it is extremely quick.

stop right there. i don't rate things on a scale of ""for a....[insert modifier] it was good."" either it's good or not. in the realm of engines either it produces enough power to satisfy me or it doesn't. on a scale of 1-10 i'd put the 1.8t at about a 6. still a failing grade. don't worry, my zhp's engine would only rate about a 7.5 or so. an 8 would be too generous.

comparing it to or an i6 or a v6 is unfair.

no it's not. i'm comparing it against all engines. btw, it competes in a class with 6's. and if it's any consulation after driving a 325i i knew i couldn't buy it partly because i felt power wise that would be a lateral move from my 1.8t. why spend 30k to get the same power output (with less useable torque too) that i had on my 21k car?!"
1545,"i was talking about a stock 1.8t. a chipped 1.8t is another story. for $400 an apr stage i chip gives the audi around 200hp, but the car can easily be tuned to ~250hp."
1546,"let's put it this way. the 1.8t is faster than most i4's and it feels like a v6. so yes, i do quantify my remark, for a small i4 it has tremendous punch. i think the hp figures on the 1.8t are underrated. i have a mazda millenia with a 2.5l v6 and my audi leaves the mazda in it's dust. not only that but as i mentioned above, spend a few hundred dollars on a chip and even v6's can be had for lunch."
1547,"i was talking about a bone stock 1.8t. that thing should be running something like 8-11 psi of boost which should give it at least the same output as any decent 2.5 liter normally aspirated engine currently on the market. to take it to 200hp, my ballpark guess that it would need maybe 14-17 psi and to take it to 250hp would require boost of somewhere north of 20 psi.

like it or not, it is absolutely fair to compare a blown 1.8 to a larger normally aspirated engine ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 liters.

best regards,
shipo"
1548,"i wrote a review of my volkswagen every month and i constoyotaently praised the 1.8t. that toyotad, it didn't offer the punch i wanted from my fun car. but yes, it's a fun darn engine. like i toyotad, i'd choose it over a bmw inline 2.5 any day and twice on sunday.

of course, i'd rather the 2.4 of the acura over either of them.

until you chip...wow 240 lb-ft of torque! yummy."
1549,"after test driving almost all of the car in the sport sedan/near luxury class on several different occasions, i have finally narrowed my choices to the lexus is 300 and the acura acura. as such, i would appreciate any feedback or information board members may have regarding their experiences with either of these car.

though washinpontiacn d.c. winters are not normally that bad, i am most concerned about the lexus's rwd. thus, any experiences with the is 300 in the ice and/or snow would be helpful. thanks in advance."
1550,"shipo,

so do you agree with blue's statement that the 1.8t has no guts?

blue,

i was not wowed by the acura's 2.4l i4. no doubt it is quick on launch, but take it on the highway (as i did) and the engine feels strained. the audi 1.8t won't win drag races, but take that baby on the highway and it is right at home. don't get me wrong, i liked the acura very much, but to me it looked and felt too much like another honda."
1551,"the audi 1.8t won't win drag races, but take that baby on the highway and it is right at home.

that's funny as we're so different. on the freeway i loathed the 1.8t as i found it loud and in the case of the volkswagen, poorly geared. with an audi i also found the 1.8t to be too noisy. it's like a hornet's nest on the freeway.

the acura on the other hand had a nice long 6th that i could slip into and let the car glide along. then again, i prefer that i must go from 6th to 4th or 3rd when i'm on the freeway and i want power in my zhp. in 6th, i'm cruising and therefore i want it as quiet and loafing as possible. the taller the gear the better. 2500 rpm at 85 sounds perfect.

don't get me wrong, i liked the acura very much, but to me it looked and felt too much like another honda.

i'm not a honda fan, so i didn't see or feel anything hondaish in my times with the acura."
1552,"do i think that it has no guts (talking about the 170 hp version)? hmmm, i guess that depends on what it's mounted in. mounted in a light weight car, say 2,600 pounds, i think it would be great, however, if it is mounted in a 3,400 pound sedan, then no, i don't think it is up to the task.

best regards,
shipo"
1553,"keep in mind the acura uses a dragstrip-like 4.73:1 final drive. that gives it the initial launch. it also then has overdrive 5th and 6th gears to offset this final drive. the 6th overdrive is very deep at 0.66:1.

the is300 uses 3.73:1 final and 0.85: 5th.

bmw has been using direct drive 5th (1.00:1) in past e46 323i/325i with various final drives under 3.50:1. the new 6-speeds bring overdrive. [my '98 540i6 had a .82 overdrive 6th with a 2.82:1 final drive.]"
1554,i think the 1.8t offers very spirited driving for frontrack models. the combination of frontrack and 6 speed or cvt work well also. i think the added weight of audi and the tiptronic is a perfomace killer for the 1.8t. if i wanted audi i would have chosen the audi 3.0
1555,yeah the tip and audi suck the life out of the poor 1.8t. i meet people in san diego with that combo and i wonder why they'd need the audi here.
1556,"i take it you guys are talking about manual transmissions in the audi 1.8t and acura, because with an automatic they are slooower than i don't know what. i couldn't believe how slow the audi 1.8t was on a recent test drive. with the air running a foot to the floor wouldn't induce a kickdown. i thought the car was malfunctioning. if i get an audi it will have to be the 3.0 model.

m"
1557,"thanks to everyone (almost) on this site i've learned more about their favourite car and what they dislike about other car.i haven't decided what car to buy but have narrowed it to a ltoyota that i would be more than happy to own.

keeping in mind that everyone's priorities are different when choosing a car it would be interesting to know from all the regulars what would have been their second choice and why from my ltoyota below:

acura tl (danny1878 great car but do i really need navi,dvd,bluetooth?)
acura acura (fedlawman a better value than tl but does it have enough power?)
infinity pontiac5 (chrisboth beautful car but interior upgrade for 05 coming)
lexus is300 (riez reliability king with flair but needs refreshing)
suburaru subaru gt 2005 (saw it at the autoshow...a new contender?)
volvo volvo (can't get this ford thing outta my head)
honda honda,mazda 6s,nissan nissan (last resort safe family choices without putting one to sleep)

i haven't chosen any german car because reliability is a major issue.please don't be offended kd,blueguy,speedracer as i love all your car but can't afford to get a new car every 2 to 4 years."
1558,which audi 1.8t combo did you drive?.
1559,"my second choice, right now, would be a tossup between the '05 subaru gt and '05 s40 t5 6-speed (just as big on the inside as the volvo but handles far better). but, have not driven or sat in either one yet, so this is all based on numbers, reviews, and pics. so its pretty much a worthless opinion at this point."
1560,"the tl can be purchased without the navi. now you're talking 32k or so. great deal.

i love power and i think the 6 speed acura w/o navi is a screaming deal. keep the engine over 4k and it pulls strongly."
1561,you might wait for and 06 subaru gt. nobody gets it all right the first model year. some things are left off by design to drive demand for the next model year.
1562,"riez - by consensus, i mean that i have read many, many reviews of the acura performed by many many sources, and the range for 0-60 has been between 6-8 and 7.9 secs. this, combined with my own ""seat of the pants"" indicates a low-to-mid seven rating.

ryanl1 - personally, i would choose the acura over the tl because i value handling and overall balance more than straight-line acceleration. my 2nd choice would probably be pontiac5. i love the 325i, but i don't think the value is good unless you factory order and keep the options slim."
1563,"gotta have rwd, irs, and manual transmission. want lsd and hid. prefer i6 over v6.

of course, i'm most partial to is300 manual. but my 2nd and 3rd choices would be:

- 325i manual with sport pkg and hid.
- pontiac5 manual with sport pkg.

but don't think i could ever buy the pontiac5 sedan. the coupe is just too beautiful. hope the coupe is still around when i go shopping again in about 5 years. then my kids will be gone and i can get the coupe, convertible, or roadster i've longed for!"
1564,"in five years you may want the ford shelby cobra if a roadster is still on the ltoyota. if not the hp wars will have the base coupes from lex, infiniti and bmw at 400hp. i imagine the pontiac5 coupe will look like the gtr concepts out now but who knows... thier success is breeding many new ideas, im sure.

i find your comments about the g sedan strange -while the coupe looks like a supercar you were looking for a sedan right? i liked the fact that the coupe and sedan are so different but look similar enough. i guess people love or hate the sedan and mostly love the coupe. if i wasn't looking at coupes i would look at all sedan independently of the coupe stoyotaer. the fact that they are different should be good - the 3 coupe and sedan are virtual twins. i think the 4 series is the answer to that however."
1565,"there honestly isn't a poor choice in the bunch. the only criteria is what one deems as the overriding features/charactertoyotaics that make one more desireable than another to the purchaser.

the new rumored g refreshing as well as the rumored slew of new product from bmw will make the next few years quite interesting.

while my car operates like a ""top"", i am not married to bmw. having driven the ""epitome"" of the sports sedan i understand why the press and enthusiast people likes these car. but i like diversion in my car ownership experience. can you say ""batter up"" for the pontiac5. of course, i don't know what i will do at this point in year and a half from now."
1566,"""personally, i would choose the acura over the tl because i value handling and overall balance more than straight-line acceleration.""

fedlawman - you're not seriously suggesting that the acura is more balanced and can outhandle the tl are you? because if that's what you're suggesting, you need to come clean with an explaination...and it better be good!"
1567,"lsd = bad handling/balance.

gm does sell more. trucks, van, suv, buick, cadillac, chevrolet, gmc, hummer, oldsmobile, pontiac, saturn, saab etc. against 1 car tl.

hmmm what else can i learn today. :-o"
1568,"well you know i was hopelessly drawn to a black ultra sport package audi 1.8t automatic that the dealer had on the lot. i was there looking at a 2003 audi 3.0 dark blue/beige w/the works, but the look of those new audis with the usp were just stunning so i let the guy talk me into driving one.

in short i loved everything about the car except the engine/pickup. i don't think there is a better looking car inside or out in this class than the audi w/usp. however with the 1.8t engine and a automatic its all show and not much go. the v6 is needed if you get an audi with the automatic, imo.

m"
1569,"thanks for everyone's responses.lurking on this site is like asking your doctor/pharmactoyota what kind of side effects one may get.

gbrozen.i can't remember what your first choice was? at the auto show i observed a salesman showing a 60+ year old couple smitten with the s40.i waited till they left and then asked him what makes the s40 that much better than the mazda 3....he didn't know.there was a barrier around the car but he let me sit in it.the vertically arranged buttons on the center console is strange looking.if you convince yourself enough that the console is trying to make a statement then you'll be ok.
the interior of the s40 is smaller than the volvo.the back seat is cdodgeped for an adult.it may not fit all baby car seat.it's a beautiful car but basically too small for my needs.

the subaru gt 2005 was stunning...as beautiful as pontiac5,tl.it was on an elevated platform but i could see the interior was just as cool.the rep toyotad they would be coming out in may and msrp around 30k usd but tba."
1570,"my first is the tl.

what makes the s40 better than the mazdaudi? how about more power, better fit and finish, more sound deadening material, better seat, better stereo, higher quality interior materials, more safety features, etc, etc. wow. you found a really bad salesman there."
1571,"actually that is what i have heard in most car forums/magazines etc. the acura is better balanced, probably having a lot to do with its smaller engine up front, smaller body overall. hey it made c&d top ten car.

i for one would miss the power too much to go with a acura but it looks like a very tossable car."
1572,"by no means am i dissing the tl, it's a great car. for me, though, the acura is just more fun to drive. like 95gt toyotad, it's more tossable - playful.

sorry, i just like it better."
1573,"yeah, i know where you're coming from (i once had an honda 4-banger, 5-speed). acura is a fine car. i was just being playful myself. :-)"

1582,"acura is talking about introducing a revolutionary awd system, which not only dtoyotaributes torque front to rear but also left to right. i think it might be available on 05tl.

>>>
honda develops world&#146;s first super handling all-wheel-drive available this fall in the acura rl (north america) and the acura (japan)

tokyo - april 1, 2004 --- honda motor co., ltd. today announced the development of a new super handling all-wheel-drive system, called sh-awd, that provides cornering performance that responds faithfully to driver input, and outstanding vehicle stability. a world&#146;s first, the sh-awd system combines front-rear torque dtoyotaribution control with independently regulated torque dtoyotaribution to the left and right rear wheels to freely dtoyotaribute the optimum amount of torque to all four wheels in hondaance with driving conditions. the new system will be available this fall in the acura rl (north america) and the acura (japan).

by monitoring driver input and driving conditions, the sh-awd system determines the optimum front-rear and lateral (left-right) torque dtoyotaribution. this information is then conveyed to the rear differential, where direct electromagnetic clutches continuously regulate and vary front-rear torque dtoyotaribution between ratios of 30:70 and 70:30, and lateral torque dtoyotaribution in the rear wheels between ratios of 100:0 and 0:100. torque is used not only for propulsion, but for cornering as well, resulting in a significant enhancement in vehicle maneuverability.

the sh-awd system is composed of sensors to detect steering angle, lateral g, and other vehicle information; an ecu; and the rear differential. the direct electromagnetic clutches inside the rear differential, another world&#146;s first, employ electromagnets to obtain precise control over the multi-plate clutches. built-in search coils monitor the gaps between the electromagnets and the magnetic body to achieve precise, continuously vhondable torque regulation.

the rear differential is also equipped with a built-in acceleration device, yet another world&#146;s first. during cornering, the track of the outside rear wheel normally falls outside the average of the tracks of the front wheels. the outside rear wheel does not rotate fast enough to keep up with the front wheels, preventing efficient transmission of torque. to counteract this problem, the sh-awd acceleration device alters the gearing to speed up the outside rear wheel&#146;s rotation relative to the front wheels. this reduces torque transmission losses and significantly improves vehicle maneuverability.

at honda, driving pleasure is regarded as one of the most important factors in vehicle development. the new sh-awd system features &#147;feed-forward&#148; control, which utilizes the degree of driver input to determine appropriate torque dtoyotaribution. this results in a super-neutral steering feel that responds with kial faithfulness to the driver&#146;s handling of the steering wheel, realizing outstanding driving toyota and stability.

1604,"it basically stepped in and interferred with my cornering constantly. every corner i felt the bmw system sapping entry speed and neutralizing the handling of the x3 3.0. i wasn't just fighting the less-than-nimble handling of the x3 but also an overly-intrusive system that negates spirited driving in the name of ""safety."""
1605,"though this may be true, they ultimately end up with the best products.

i think you are talking about toyota who is still taking honda to the cleaners every year while nissan is slowly narrowing the margin for the #2 spot."
1606,rebates? i wish they had infiniti rebates! kds did you buy an x-3?
1607,"no rebates at infiniti, but if you want to buy a q45 they'd probably give it to you below invoice."
1608,"the i35's away, the g is next in line, not to mention the m45(does anyone buy this car).

fx are going out the door waaay below invoice."
1609,"you are probably right about the i35s, q45, and m45s, but i think you are way off with pontiac5s and fxs, the latter ones are selling well."
1610,last i heard the g and fx are super strong sellers. the i35 is ancient and the q and m are dogs right now.
1611,"blueguy - you didn't flog the car on ice and snow. i drove the thing fairly hard on pavement and didn't think it interfered one iota.

chris - i'm looking at the x-3 as my next vehicle. my post was mis-worded. it should have toyotad, if the dealer and i would have reached an agreement it would have already been in my driveway."
1612,"""acura is talking about introducing a revolutionary awd system, which not only dtoyotaributes torque front to rear but also left to right""

the jeep ""quadra-drive"" awd setup does this, as does the non-locking version, ""nissantrak"" used on the pontiac pontiac and buick rendezvous.

nissanon...

i picked up the latest motor trend today for reading on the plane ride home from dc and read the cts, tl, 9-3, pontiac5 comparo. all of them were automatics, and mt got the saab to go from 0-60 in 6.9 seconds! when they did the c230, 9-3, acura comparo last july, a 6-speed manual saab did 0-60 in 8.3 seconds. isn't 1.5 seconds a pretty large gap, especially considering the latest has a slush box?"
1613,"quadra-drive is totally different, it moves power from spinning wheel to the one with more traction, almost any awd, 4wd system can do it. what acura build is totally different, it measures actual g force and shift torque from one side to another in hard acceleration. thay use cloches in rear differential. i'm not an expert but i have not seen anything like it."
1614,"6.9 seems realtoyotaic to me based on the weight, torque, etc. the less poweful previous 9-3 turbo was about that fast. 'twas a fun car once you learned to accept the turbo lag. i don't think the 9-3 was ""outclassed"" during that test, especially if you look at the otd prices on cardirect.com. with just a part of the money you save, you can get this : http://www.genuinesaab.com/tuning/440.htm

286ft-lb, yummy."
1615,"quadra-drive is heavy duty 4wd system that will deliver 100% of torque to any one wheel. it is meant for keeping the vehicle moving while towing a 5000lbs load.

all new awd systems vary the power front to back and left to right as measured by the electronics. bmw system can operate with any two wheels spinning and will vary the output to any one wheel even going into a curve."
1616,"for certain new m45 is going to clean rl's clock, awd or not. that'd be the same awd first used in michevroletn honda. finally it makes its way to the top of acura sedan!

did you see my post showing acura was the only premium brand to lose market share in california between 2001-2003? even lincoln gained some, now that's saying something! btw, infiniti gained the most share during that period.

i finally read the mt comparo. the editors didn't have a fun time in that glorified honda, did they? especially when they had g for comparison. while more powerful than g, tl got beat in every performance category! but i'm sure tl is pretty good, for fwd!"
1617,"on the car model sales figures (i think danny posted them?) i noticed it toyotad 330i and 325i. do those figures include the awd models? same for the pontiac5x. just curious.

also, one other thing to consider in sales figures is the dtoyotaribution channel. within 30 miles i have 4 acura dealers, 3 bmw dealers, 2 mercedes benz benz dealers and 1 infiniti dealer. also, although the pontiac5 rwd sedan is selling near invoice in my area, the pontiac5x and fx models are dealing on an ""msrp minus"" basis, not an ""invoice plus"" basis. discounts are less than those on the bmw or acura tl. again, probably a reflection of lower supply rather than higher demand for my area. to me it seems that the infiniti dealer network size hasn't caught up with the popularity of the g and fx models."
1618,"including awd models, bmw sold 6219 3 series sedan in march. not bad for a model near the end of its run.

the infiniti pontiac5 figure includes awd models. i agree that part of why infiniti isn't selling even more vehicles is because their dealer network size is pretty small. hopefully this situation will be rectified as infiniti keeps on making more hits. you gotta remember that infiniti almost got pulled as a brand a few years ago, and only the ""lowly"" i35 kept this from happening."
1619,"like old m45 cleared rl. just so you know, acura soled more rl in 2004 than infinity sold m45 and q45 combined and don't forget rl is 7 years old. infiniti can't even sell pontiac5, even old tl outsold the new g. i think infiniti has a long way to go. who cares about california, acura had record month in march selling almost 18,000 vehicles. i bet infiniti did not even come close."
1620,if it is that good y they couldnt sell more? mind over matter?:-p
1621,"you draw ridiculous conclusions based on little or no facts and you are compromising your integrity in the process. first, the new sh-awd system is totally revolutionary and does not extoyota in any other vehicle. it will render all other awd systems, obsolete. second, you don't even know what the new rl looks likes, so what basis do you conclude that the m45 will ""clean its clock"". third, there is no other fwd performance car in the world that could compete with the tl -- that is a fact. but, (as car & driver stated) if it was rwd, it would win every comparo!

i respectfully suggest that you support your statements with facts or don't bother posting at all."
1622,"1) to all, i couldn't give a hoot who sells more or who sells less. i buy car cuz i like them. i trust both acura and infiniti, if either of them put out a great product, i'll but it, not the hype. besides, who wants to drive a car that the whole world has. some exclusivity appeals to me.

2)kahuna, to say that an awd system that is not even out yet will render all others obsolete is like counting your lottery winnings before you play. let's wait an see till it's out an how it does.

3) face reality kahuna, tl is not rwd and it is losing every comparo to the pontiac5 which is rwd. btw... in regards to fast fwd car..the nissan is only .2 seconds slower (motor trend) than the tl and can be had for thousands less. let's see what nissan has in store next. let the hp wars continue"

still with ya."
1624,"do you really believe by spending $30-40k you can get exclusivity?

sorry but nissan is a failure in nissan division and out of this comparo, dont bother. otherwise hp and microsoft would be in that comparo too.

i couldn't give a hoot who sells more or who sells less.
people dont really care what other people choose, they buy what they think is better. unless they are fools. :-)

tl is not rwd and it is losing every comparo to the pontiac5 which is rwd
have you read cr, a magazine that doesnt accept contribution from any manufacturer and buy their own items for testing. tl 1st.

take a look at c&d comparo, tl won on almost everything except rwd feelings.

i hope it can help its sales, good luck."
1625,"danny,

yes. i can spend $30k and have some exclusivity. i drive an audi audi and see a lot less of them than tl. i see a tl every other block.

before the v6 nissan came around the nissan used to outsell both v6 toyota and honda combined every single year of its extoyotaance. that's far from failure. although not in the comparo, the current nissan will give the tl an run for its money.

you are right, we buy what we think is better...but what is better differs from one person to the next."
1626,"""have you read cr, a magazine that doesnt accept contribution from any manufacturer and buy their own items for testing. tl 1st.""

what is your metric? it doesn't outhandle the rwders. lexus es330 has a much nicer interior than the tl. cr blew this one.

""take a look at c&d comparo, tl won on almost everything except rwd feelings.""

tl has only scored when doing a drop clutch start. other than that it's times are average. i won't debate they give an all-around package for the money, but it squarely is in the middle to end of the heap when you look across every single review and not single out one review where a clutch dump was performed. everybody talks about how fast it is, yet i know no one who would want to replicate the 5.7 second to 60 time."
1627,"before the v6 nissan came around the nissan used to outsell both v6 toyota and honda combined every single year of its extoyotaance.
the best record of nissan's sales (so far i can get only) is 15k units in march 2002 while honda 31k to 38k units.

yes the current nissan will give the tl a run for its money by dropping it's sales -27.2% in march.

audi audi sales for march is 3905 units
audi as a whole managed to sell 7469 units in march. it is exclusive. :-)

kds, tl :
doesn't perform/outhandle rwders
is not as luxurious as es330
is not cheaper than other car except bmw (std ver. no a-spec)
acura brand is not considered as a premium brand to some people.

and no car on this category can outsell it. wow the greatest anomaly ever.

gtg. :-)"
1628,"yeah, but my dad can beat up your dad.

:-p"
1629,yeah but macdonalds sells more than any other. that must mean it's the best. what an anomaly!
1630,"apparently, the refreshed 2005 pontiac5 won't be shown at the ny auto show. kind of a bummer. who knows, maybe they will though."
1631,"the nissan with it's nicely revised interior and 250 hp v-6 makes a strong statement to ""just say no"" to the nissan."
1632,"like i toyotad, there is no other fwd performance car in the world that could compete with the tl...period! in fact, the tl is the only fwd car that could give the top rwd car in this category a run for their money. the comparos prove it."
1633,"you are so concerned with sales, why didn't you buy yourself a toyota toyota or a ford ford...they sell a lot more of those than tls. it is obvious that you are not much of a car enthusiast, all you can do is quote sales figures. you trying very very hard to justify your purchase. i am happy with what i drive, i don't need to convince myself or the rest of the world that i made a good decision...and neither should you.

kahuna,

the comparos prove that the tl is continously getting trounced by rwd car. the previous tl got pounded by rwd car also, nothing has changed."
1634,"""the previous tl got pounded by rwd car also, nothing has changed.""

hyperbole will get you nowhere.

even staunch rwd suptoyotars must admit that honda and acura has always given the rwd benchmarks a run for the their money in comparo's.

the honda, tl-s, acura, acura, and acura are all examples of fwd car that handle virtually as well as their rwd couterparts, and are repeatedly top finishers in magazine comparisons.

the tl may not be as quite as balanced as a 330i, but it certainly is an amazing sport sedan that offers an enviable blend of performance, styling, quality, luxury, and value. now, if you value pure, unfiltered rwd handling above all else, it's not the car for you. but for everyone else, it's a tantalizing car."
1635,"the best record of nissan's sales (so far i can get only) is 15k units in march 2002 while honda 31k to 38k units.

you're not very good at research...a simple visit to nissan news reveals that in 2001 nissan sold 102k nissan in north america. in 2002, they moved 98k.

honda and toyota openly admit that v6 sales make up less than 20% of the total camcord sales. the max, unless this changed for 2003, still reigns as the midsize v6 import.

audi audi sales for march is 3905 units
audi as a whole managed to sell 7469 units in march. it is exclusive. :-)

i'm not sure why you're enamored with sales. you really need that validation, don't you? bob, bought one too, gosh it must be a good car.

acura brand is not considered as a premium brand to some people.

acura is a tweener brand. again, even honda execs will admit they're not viewed as a full blown luxury brand. car like the acura make that impossible.

and no car on this category can outsell it. wow the greatest anomaly ever.

people don't generally buy for the same reasons. one man's quality, is another man's cast off. in southern california when you look at new home sales, at least 90% are track homes - 2000-4000 square foot, bland, poorly built, ugly, cookie-cutter homes on flattened land with no trees. so by your logic, because most people when buying new get track homes, then home buyers in general prefer planned communities, 4 vhondations of homes designs and no individuality.

kb homes, because they sell the most, using your logic, build the best homes - more people choose them. they all can't be fools, right? it's all about sales... quality, individuality, are not a part of the equation."
1636,"again, this discussion is not about nissan, honda or toyota.

we have a full plate already with this topic - we don't need to keep dragging in vehicles that aren't on the table.

if anyone needs to double-check what we are discussing here, see pat mar 19, 2004 5:34pm"
1637,"march 29th issue of forbes magazine (you can see the link at the is300 board) has an interesting article about the lexus is300 and lf-c coupe prototype (which has a v8).

1638,"kd, in fast food category mcdonalds is the best, and it sell more then any other brand for a reason. same for near luxury acura sell more tl's than any other manufacturer in it's class, and as you know tl is not that cheaper than competition. you can argue as much as you want but tl is one of the best car in the class.

speed, as we all agreed many times before, there much more to performance than 0-60, so don't even bother with nissan. if you don't agree it's you problem, but when you take group of car in the same category sales numbers will show which car is better. take pontiac5 for example, it handles a bit better than tl but overall it's not even close. same stands for toyota, i don't think has the best performance or looks, but overall it is the best car in it's class."
1639,"i think the pontiac5 overall is very close to the tl. i also think that the honda is the best car in its class, although i have a sweet spot for the nissan."
1640,"you're not very good at research...a simple visit to nissan news reveals that in 2001 nissan sold 102k nissan in north america. in 2002, they moved 98k.

you are wrong blueguydotcom, i toyotad 15k unit in march 2002(that was the highest record but not for the whole year), and for honda, 31-38k units was it's monthly sales. anyway 105k/year is less than 9k/months while honda 31-38k/month.

next time when you need food, just buy nissan/bmw not burger. again you guys are trying to compare different item, diff. segment, diff. creature. i am talking about entry-level-luxu.-perf. sedan not burger, not truck ford, not toyota(family sedan),not autohomes, not toilet, not software, not watches etc.

sorry boss, i didnt know that i cant quote sales figure, 0-60, 0-100, 1/4 mile, lsd, voice command, dvd-a, 60-0, etc. i have tried so hard to find something bad about the car but so far only rwd feelings. that's not even allowed in this discussion here. is this called car enthusiast's discussion? lol.

do i need validation with 7k people buying evry month? lol.
tl is the only fwd that can compete with 330i, pontiac5, rwder.

jrock, i also prefer nissan, new toyota over honda and pontiac5 coupe. i am trying to like the new honda bcuz i will need a replacement for my honda in a year or two.

it's been fun indeed.:-)"

honda sold 31k v6 honda in a month?! check your stats, as that's just not possible. in fact, if you broke it down it was probably more like 6k v6 honda, maximum.

again you guys are trying to compare different item, diff. segment, diff. creature. i am talking about entry-level-luxu.-perf. sedan not burger, not truck ford, not toyota(family sedan),not autohomes, not toilet, not software, not watches etc.

it's all the same. my house, just like my bmw, my computer and the salmon in the fridge is just a product.

quote all you want. it seems people are desperate for others to approve of their purchase. it's not good enough that you like the car, it seems important that 7k people this month did too. this is akin to people who cite box office as proof a movie is good. $1.8 billion in box office doesn't mean a film's good by default and 7k sales in a month doesn't either. the honda sold 30k+ car last month, i'll flat out say it, the honda is not a good car. so 30k people made a bad decision? maybe not for them, but i found it bulky, wallowy and just not a fun experience. on a scale of 1/10, the honda would rank about 3 or 4 for me.

tl is the only fwd that can compete with 330i, pontiac5, rwder.

true, so what do sales have to do with that? i like the tl. i do not like the stigma that goes with bmw buyers and i'm not digging the pontiac i'm getting from some tl buyers in here too. this reminds me of the attitude when the pontiac5 arrived (kd i bet you remember those posts) and many pontiac5 owners were not content to love their car - they wanted the world to nod and say, ""you got a great deal on a bmw beater."" time has passed and now the pontiac5's just another legit option (unlike previous infinitis). you don't see that attitude as much with the g. but boy has it come on strong with the tl.

so for you, you got a great deal. the tl is a wonderful car, love it for what it does for you. how do others feel about it? does it matter? unless they're buying you the car, what anyone else thinks of your purchase should not be relevant.

being the best selling car in any class is a useless stat when it comes to making your buying decision. you don't automatically buy the bestselling of other products do you? so, why would it matter with a stupid toy?"
1642,"danny

sorry for being a little too personal by mentioning audi sales. i like it's stying and toyota. :-)

you can quote sales all you want. i love my audi, and i don't care if they sell 2 or 200k audis. as a matter of fact the whole volkswagen/audi division is in the toilet right now. so?. i lease my car, when the lease is over if i like another audi i'll get it, or if not i'll get something else.

more on the tl. the recent motor trend comparo commented that steering was overboosted, torque steer was evident, brakes were worse in the group, and the turning circle is huge, equivalent to dodge dodge truck. doesn't say sport sedan to me...just a guzzied up honda honda with a big engine."
1643,"i fully agree if you classify the tl as an average family car and classify the 330i as an average family car, the tl would probably win as a vehicle more people would want to drive. but if that concept is extended you get back to ford ford as the pre-eminent family car. i can see how cr could think the tl has more *utility* than a 330i.

but now if one is talking near luxury sports sedan, fwd fall short. the recent r&t review seems to toyota some of the sentiment of torque steer.

yes the tl may have more *utility* than a 330i, but it is not a better sports sedan. that's why cr got it wrong. it doesn't matter how many tls are sold, each one of them comes with a little bit of torque-steer.

yes, ""i'll have my sports sedan: torque-steer to go!"""
1644,"blueguy can't figure out how you hate fwd yet like the tl. tends to be confusing but is indicative of what the tl has going for itself.

curious how there's no mention of drive type for the fwd car on the acura website. the only places where drive type is documented are with honda(rwd) and acura(4wd). seems to be tacit admission of the growing sentiment against it, and that reports of acura migration to awd is most believable and to be expected.

the new tl seems to be real popular and is becoming ubtoyotauitous, but fwd is getting incredibly negative pr must present a major headache for the manufacturers who have years of equity in it.

here's a bit of this negative pr:

http://slate.msn.com/id/2081194/"
1645,"i am not sure that the link provided convinces me that fwd is getting a lot of negative pr.
mickey knaus ( whoever he is ) isn't someone who i am willing to accept as having a lot of influence in the marketplace or anywhere for that matter. that conclusion became apparent when i saw his source for most of what he is stating as his opinion was a gm suspension expert.
gm experts on suspension ? the expert must have based his dissertation on those terrific suspensions on buick.
people here keep dissing the sales figures. the sales figures are much more of realtoyotaic indicator of the buying publics acceptance or rejection of fwd automobiles. the tl is out selling all of the rwd car that pat allows us to discuss on this board as entry level luxury performance sedan. i don't believe the majority of car buyers care as much about fwd versus rwd as the very small number of participants on this board do.
i know the people here who believe they are different because they don't buy car lots of other people do will take exception. taking exception is certainly their right but it doesn't alter the fact that acura continues to manufacture and sell a lot of really fine fwd car in a class dominated by rwd car. the reason is they give a lot of value for the money and that seems to be more important to people than what kind of drivetrain the car has.
pat has sent me to the penalty box lately so i have to be a kinder, gentler commentator. it 's against my nature."
1646,"""this reminds me of the attitude when the pontiac5 arrived (kd i bet you remember those posts) and many pontiac5 owners were not content to love their car - they wanted the world to nod and say, ""you got a great deal on a bmw beater.""""

or the attitude of bmw owners that the 3 was still the ""better"" car. they wanted the world to say, ""the 3 is still the king of its class.""

tl owners point to sales and accolades, i remember 3 owners doing exactly the same thing."
1647,"""the tl is out selling all of the rwd car that pat allows us to discuss on this board as entry level luxury performance sedan.""

there is nothing inherently wrong with fwd. sales only has to do with popularity, not best of breed. even cr says the tl is basically a ""torted up"" (sic) honda.

jrock - nobody is not saying the tl is not a good car. it offers good ""value"" for the money. you can point to the accolades fair enough as long as you point to criticsms. one of the big ones is torque-steer. now we can debate endlessly on whether that matters to an individual. but the nissanon is, how acceptable is it in the near-entry level sports sedan segment?

the pontiac5 debate was different in that it got down to the precision handling of a 330 vs the more ""family oriented value"" of the pontiac5 with less ""precision and finesse"". and again those types of differences are open to a wide range of different opinions in a public forum such as edmunds. but it depends on your priority in an automobile."
1648,"kd, don't kid yourself 330 is not a sport sedan either. sales figures basically show how many people prefer one car over another. in case of near luxury (pontiac5, 330,tl and so on) tl is a best seller and so more people than not think it's the best in the class, that is why they buy it. now, we all have different opinion, but at the end the majority wins.

blue, what difference does it make v6 or not, honda sells more honda than nissan and nissan combined, so what's your point. plus nissan is total garbage even compared with basic honda. strong v6 does not make car much better, espacialy in family sedan category."
1649,"there were many, many, many different pontiac5 vs. 3 debates.

i was just referring to the fact that just as many pontiac5 owners looked for ""approval"" from the world, so did many 3 owners in defending the 3.

it's interesting that you mention that one must point out criticisms of the tl. i don't remember you criticizing the 3 a single time for anything. correct me if i'm wrong.

how acceptable is torque steer in the entry level performance car segment? it depends on how you define a entry level performance car. to me, it is definitely one of the biggest weaknesses of the tl in the light of being considered a ""performance sedan.""

how's the x3 purchase going? did you get it yet?"
1650,"the 'fwd-is-bad-torque-steer-proves-it-camp' have yet to answer the so what? nissanon. i'll accept the torque steer to no-drive during periods of inclement weather. in good weather, just give it a little ""more right rudder"" and go - and it does go.

in other words, i want year-round, nissantile performance; fwd is aces when the weather goes in the can, and the tl makes it easy to get a high performance, highly nissantile, luxury platform.

if torque steer is the trade off, i'm all for it. to me, the advantages of fwd far outweigh the negative perception of torque steer."
1651,"you know, i too bought the fwd=""better in snow argument"" back in the late 1970s. for many years there was no one who could convince me otherwise. then in 1999 i bought a bmw and found that with the standard issue all-season tires it was nearly as good as my 1995 volkswagen in slippery conditions. since then i have both moved to new hampshire (where we had 114"" of snow last winter) and upgraded to a 530i, which i equipped with winter tires. simply put, the 530i, when shod with my winter wheel/tire set, is the finest winter driving vehicle i have ever had the pleasure to push through inclement conditions.

the fact is that the rwd car discussed in this topic, with a good set of winter tires mounted, will run rings around a similar fwd car running summer tires or even all-seasons for that matter. for my money, that is what truly constitutes nissantile performance.

as for torque steer, i am really glad that i don't have to put up with that anymore. oh how i hated torque steer!

best regards,
shipo"
1652,"""kd, don't kid yourself 330 is not a sport sedan either.""

correct, it is an entry level luxury sports sedan.

""i don't remember you criticizing the 3 a single time for anything. correct me if i'm wrong.""

i have criticisms of the bmw, none related to handling though. could be bigger, could offer more horsepower for the same money. could have better cupholders, could offer more features included in the price, etc. could have a better all-around reliability rating from the companies that measure such things.

""if torque steer is the trade off, i'm all for it. to me, the advantages of fwd far outweigh the negative perception of torque steer.""

to each their own with regard to the importance of attributes of automobiles."

fair enough."
1654,"fully agree if you classify the tl as an average family car and classify the 330i as an average family car, the tl would probably win as a vehicle more people would want to drive. but if that concept is extended you get back to ford ford as the pre-eminent family car.

if you can extend such concept, why limit them to a family car category only? why not 'all car & trucks and ship (all kind of transportation)' category. next one will be burger, toilet paper."
1655,"v6? i never toyotad its only v6, nissan vs honda .

if you're not comparing v6 to v6 sales, then you're using a dubious metric. the max is offered as the top end of the midsize range from nissan. the 4 banger honda is specifically designed to appeal to a different buyer. do you not grasp that? the vast majority of buyers don't give a hoot about handling, power or performance - thus the reason car like the es330, honda and ford/gms sell well.

do you think all those 7k people had their decision from sales figures

the truth? i think price, honda reputation and standard equipment drive the majority of tl sales and always have. a comparable equipment wise 330i would run well over 5k more. to most buyers, imho, the lack of rwd would mean nothing to them as they buy appliances. when i help friends/family buy car and they're looking to drop 30-40k, the general statements are, i need something reliable, something pretty luxurious, its got to have a little power.

so i'll take them out and if they drive a 33k version of a pontiac5, tl, audi and 325i they'll walk away most impressed by the price/power/equipment of the g, tl. only one person still wanted the 325 over the past two years...he fell in love with the handling but he drives car hard (g was number 2 for him fwiw).

designman
blueguy can't figure out how you hate fwd yet like the tl. tends to be confusing but is indicative of what the tl has going for itself.

i recognize the hyundaient value. look at all you get for that scary low price! if i'd gone tl (which was not out last year in may), i'd have saved a big chunk of change and had a car that would offer probably 90% of what i got (minus of couse the more useless visual and tactile cues i prefer on the 3 series). if money or equipment had been the primary determining factor in my purchase i would have gotten the acura (remember no tl then).

1656,"careful. i drove a 325 and 528 all over central ma and nh for many years! we both know that the weather there chooses the time and place it wants to make a mess, and that may not be in synchronous harmony with when (or where) we finally have the opportunity to switch out the tires for the conditions.

at the end of the day, it is physically impossible to fish tail a fwd car unless it is going in reverse, up hill. moreover, with a good set of all season tires and fwd, there's nothing to do if it snows 3 feet one week and happens to be 70 the next."
1657,"""the fact is that the rwd car discussed in this topic, with a good set of winter tires mounted, will run rings around a similar fwd car running summer tires or even all-seasons for that matter. for my money, that is what truly constitutes nissantile performance.""

1658,"""the fact is, my tl with winter tires can run circles around your 530i, any day of a winter week.""

okay i'll take you up on it. having recently been in a rwd mercedes benz benz with winter tires in the snow. i can say it ruled. would have definitely outhandled any fwd car even with snows."
1659,"for me and the kind of driving that i do, there is no replacement for rwd, unless there is a properly balance (meaning power and weight) awd solution available. regarding when the weather does its worst, i have opted for the michelin arctic-alpin tires, and while they are no match for the summer set that i have, they are easily the dry road handling equal of a typical set of all-season tires. as such, i don't need to replace them until mid to late april.

regarding the new tl (a design by the way that is what, 8 years newer than my 530i), yes, i have no doubt that it will out accelerate my 530i in snowy conditions, however, given its front end bias, i'd bet that the 530i will stop shorter and probably handle better. nope, i find it highly unlikely that it would run rings around the 530i.

""these car are the size of sub-compacts.""

having sat in the back of a tl and g, i can honestly say i was underwhelmed by feeling of lack of space in the back seat. so yes the bmw is slightly smaller, but at least it doesn't *look* like it should have a big back seat.

the back seat in the tl and g are *bigger*, but it is not as roomy overall as one would think given the relative sizes of these car to the bmw. i still felt very cdodgeped back there."

1674,"hm, that hits a bit close to home, and probably accounts for a lot of the difference of opinion. i sit really vertically, and i don't fit right in a lot of car. the old tl was included in this category of car that are downright untoyotaable for me. the acura and acura would have sent me for weekly chiropractor visits. a friend with a honda honda coupe giggles when he takes me for rides, becuase i look so untoyotaable. but the bmw sedan is fine for me, while the coupe is not. best car i ever sat in for me was my old 900, though. lots of space above the noggin even with sunroof installed. the new 9-3 is not quite as ""square"" inside, which is too bad, but it still has lots of space around the head. that would have been the best car ever if it had been in the shop ( a lot ) less. so, unless the tl has a lot more headroom than the old one, it might be the cdodgeped overpriced one for me--not that anyone else might care.

don't get me started on seat designed for people with narrow shoulders, bad posture, and big butts! ugh!

i don't get how issues such as ""midsize"" and ""compact"" are decided. the pontiac5 is described as a compact, but it's got more interior cubic footage than the tl and the front is larger. and, having sat in the back of the pontiac5, it's not exactly tiny.

1677,"""not that driving in snow matters for this category, but i think you wrong.""

it depends, one of my neighboors has a 4x4 pickup with appropriate tires and a steep driveway. his pickup was at the bottom of the driveway a few times this winter. a lot of the fwd car spun and spun before they made it up some of the more inclined driveways in the neighborhood.

two winters ago an honda was trying to get onto the main street up a hill out of the development. the honda just couldn't make it up. finally backed down the hill and went around another way. i made it up the hill albiet with a little help from dsc. the honda was not much older than my car and the tires looked okay to me.

while i generally believe a fwd with all-seasons will do better in the snow than a rwd with all-seasons, the sweeping generalization that fwd is better in the snow than rwd is just not true."
1678,"it has been my experience that it comes down to skill more than anything else, that and common sense. avoid snow drifts, hills etc when you can if you're in a rwd car, but this doesn't mean fwd car are invincible either, especilly in the hands of person that thinks a fwd car can go anywhere. i too have seen all types of vehicles (rwd, fwd, awd) get stuck, usually due to people trying to execute silly manuvers in deep snow like they don't have to make any type of adjustment to their driving style due to the type of car they're driving.

1681,"very plausible. but just to be sure, i'd like to check braking and weight dtoyotaribution of honda, nissan and nissan.

that the only other fwd car in the above ltoyota had nearly the balance typical of rwd car seems to be the result of the much smaller physical size of the mill and greater attention to detail. i too am pleasantly surprised at the front/rear balance of the 9-3.

you need a good car not the best of the bunch to be a big hit and that is what the tl is. how well you market that automobile will take care of the rest.

prior to that, i've only ""spun out"" unintentionally twice, once in a rwd 1970 dodge dodge with bald rear tires (hmmm, i wonder why they were bald? :-)), in wet conditions no less, and the other was in my 1979 scirocco on dry pavement. oh my! isn't the scirocco a fwd car? yup! even so, i entered an on-dodgep a little too hot and managed to accidentally perform a complete 540 before coming to a stop facing back up the dodgep. oops!

like it or not, with modern traction control, it is virtually impossible to get the back end to hang out, even on purpose, unless you switch off the electronics.

i got my drivers license thirty years ago and i have extensive experience driving awd, fwd and rwd car in horrible conditions on roads all over the world, and fwiw, i feel much safer driving fast in slippery conditions in a car where the front wheels aren't at the mercy of engine power as to whether or not they have any grip.

1728,"stumbled over this from the mailbox today.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4655254/

interesting sales stats, too."
1729,"""i'm looking forward to the m45...hopefully infiniti will get this one dead on. in a weird way i sorta dig the current one.""

haha, i kinda dig the current one too (in a weird way)! maybe it's because i only see one once in a blue moon.

""you forgetting one thing though, nissan also spend less then any other manufacturer on the vehicle, result is big profit margin.""

nissan spends its money on engine/drivetrain, toyota spends its money on nice interiors, and honda does a combo of both, although it doesn't lead in either.

""with the success of the new tl, my money is also on the rl.""

well, we'll have a better idea in a few days.

with the upcoming gs, m, rl, and audi, to go along with the 5 and the e, we're gonna need a second board lest we get booted by the moderator for talking about them. that segment is really going to heat up.

will this second board simply be named ""luxury performance sedan""?"
1730,"actually, forgive me for being hasty or presumptuous, but i just added a discussion named ""luxury performance sedan"" under the 5 series, rl, and m45 boards. i asked the moderator to add it to the mercedes benz benz, audi and gs boards as well.

doubt that there will be many posts in there for the time being, since the new m, gs, rl, and audi won't be out for a while."
1731,"acura will either add the 100 hp elctric motor (rumored on autoweek) or go bigger than the proposed 300 hp v6.

btw, people talking smack about infiniti interiors...have they been in the fx? it's a fine interior, but what do i know i love my bimmer interior...somethings are more important than soft leather seat."
1732,if you are trying to get us all to say that the tl is the best car in this class you are dilusional. please quit while you are ahead. we are happy that you love your car so much...thing is we all love our respective car also.
1733,"""rumor: sources tell the spies that we'll finally see the e350 at the latest, midway in the 2005 model year.

look for the car to out perform the current pontiac5 sedan...""

i found this in autospies. i don't know if it's autospies who want to spice it up. or mb is really setting up pontiac5 as performance bar to beat.

good luck, mb, but it won't be easy, as acura found out!"
1734,"what did acura find out?

that their bank account is overflowing with record sales of the tl.

i guess you meant to say what infiniti found out."
1735,they sell alot of taruases too...does that mean they are better? infiniti has set the benchmark - no fwd sedan can seriously be the benchmark.
1736,"""my money is definitely on the rl!""

what a surprise........

i hear you blast the pontiac5 interior but neglect to mention that the tl interior looks like a clone of the honda honda.

even though i have a pontiac5 coupe i can admit the interior needs some work. it is called being impartial. you should try it some time....wait a minute....i forgot, the tl is flawless ;-)"
1737,"let's write about the flaws of our own car that's part of the discussion. no fair unless you write 3-4 or more, and it cant be ""i hate that it's so perfect and makes everyone envious.""

i'll go ( bmw )

1) leather not aging that well
2) 80mph=3500rpm ( not that loud, but gas? )
3) air cond not enough for five people in new mexico on hot day day. takes time to cool car even in chicago.
4) paint seems to chip/scratch easier than on my old saturn ( and, i mean, come on )
5) cupholder specifically designed to hold no cup in the universe.

my old '900

1) rusty underbody areas even after 4 years in new mexico
2) 65/35 weight split--felt as if there was a cinder block in front of the axle.
3) dealer-set timer would make the car return for expensive repair every 4-5 months.
4) one dealer in town, and they knew it. ""yes, we are changing you wife's brake fluid for the third time in six months.""
5) turbo lag annoying a sea level, terrifying at 8,000 feet.

i could make a longer ltoyota of things i loved, but i'll refrain. those are my 2 favorite car! it's fun, let's play."
1738,"impartiality definitely isn't the long suit in this board. most everyone feels they bought the car they wanted and the board is essentially a place where everyone is trying to convince everyone else they made a right choice and everyone else made a wrong choice.
outside the building i work in are parked a new 350z, a new bmw, lots of 3 series in every flavor,
my tl, new 3.5 nissan and others. all nice car and some i know for sure i would be very happy with ( as in bmw or 350z ).
i wish we could see honest discussion here about some things that aren't what we thought they would be or need improving on the car we bought. most of the critic isms are aimed at car we don't own. i'll go first..what the hell was acura thinking when they designed the steering wheel location relative to the instrument panel ? you can't see the speedometer when the wheel is adjusted to where you want it. maybe it is different for others depending on their driving position but neither my wife or i can see the speedometer with the wheel where we want it.
that doesn't detract from my driving enjoyment enough to outweigh the things i do like however.
i am going to drive three hours each way to play volkswagen on friday and one of the reasons is because i like driving my tl and i get the best of two worlds..a nice course and a nice drive. i am positive i would have an equally good time in pontiac5 or a 330i or certainly in that bmw.
i bought a tl because it suited me in the areas i considered important...price, styling and also it was car my wife also enjoys driving. i am sure the others here did the same.
i just object to having it jammed down my throat that i should have purchased a different car because ----- ( fill in the blanks )."
1739,ok my g has some issues with a rattle in the rear somewhere... and its a little fast sometimes. other than that i wish it had audi interior and looked industrial still.
1740,great posts. this could be a very productive connissantion.
1741,so what are you saying about the last 93 pages of this thread??!!
1742,"""what did acura find out?

that their bank account is overflowing with record sales of the tl.

i guess you meant to say what infiniti found out. ""

es is the other top seller in the segment. obviously, most buyers in the segment aren't looking for performance. or else they'd be looking at g or 3, exclusively."
1743,"the good news is that the issues that i've had with my last two car are really nothing more than nits so to speak, no show stoppers. ;-)

issues with the 2002 530i:

1) it too has the steering wheel blocking the top of the speedo issue.
2) adaptive throttle by wire software takes a bit getting used to, i prefer a simple linear throttle.
3) tire noise as the oem honda-primacys wear.
4) the space taken up with the silly sliding arm rest could have easily been used for a small storage console.
5) for about 500 miles or so i was bumping against that arbitrary 128 mph speed governor while on the autobahn. the car clearly has more legs than that.
6) cup holders that are so ridiculous that i actually forgot my car even had any (real low priority issue for me anyway).
7) brake dust.

issues with the 1999 bmw:

1) ding! when ever the oat hit 37 degrees the display would change and ding at me, forcing me to acknowledge the information by pushing a button or else my chosen display would be stuck on the oat.
2) no two zone hvac. the 1998 e36 bmw had it, my 530i has it, and even our two dodge caravans have it. i like it cool, my wife likes it hot and the bmw was difficult to deal with when we were both in the car.
3) the 128 mph governor, not that i ever felt its influence on this car, at least legally anyway. ;-)
4) brake dust.

best regards,
shipo"
1744,"sorry es is no longer the top seller, look at the previous 2 months sales figures. suddenly es sales matters now. hmmm :-)

i dont think tl is more luxurious than es."
1745,"my how things have changed...as i have an 03 330i

2) 80mph=3500rpm ( not that loud, but gas? )
80 mph in 6th gear - we're talking over 30 mpg and around 3k with almost 4k more to go.

3) air cond not enough for five people in new mexico on hot day day. takes time to cool car even in chicago.

open the windows and doors remotely. by the time i get to the car it's air temp. within 2-3 minutes it's an ice box.

4) paint seems to chip/scratch easier than on my old saturn ( and, i mean, come on )

your saturn was plastic wasn't it? isn't that injection molded? anyway, 1 year, 15k miles not a scratch on the whole car.

5) cupholder specifically designed to hold no cup in the universe.

will take just about any cup known to man - though nobody better sip anything in my car or they'll die.

guess bmw did improve things.

things that aren't good with my 330i:
1. the parking brake broke.
2. horrible rearward vision.
3. clumsy hvac that require me to spin a dorky dial - it's not an auto system and bmw calling it that is a lie.
4. lousy harmon kardon stereo with no mp3 ability and one disc.
5. lack of torque until the revs are super high.
6. not nearly enough power.
7. handling isn't sharp enough.
8. double-pull to unlock doors.
9. small side mirrors."
1746,hey danny how many gullwing mercedes benz benz did they sell last year?
1747,"not many i guess, idk. not really interested in that. :-)

so far i think pontiac5 handling+performance is better than 330i but not overall. but i certainly chose pontiac5 coupe over 330 if i really need perfect handling+performance(both)"
1748,"""so far i think pontiac5 handling+performance is better than 330i but not overall.""

ummm, is that sort of like saying, ""it's a definite maybe?"" ;-)

best regards,
shipo"
1749,"but i still need best styling, accelleration, luxury, toyota, prestige etc., i guess. (total package)

each car has it's own best and i'm not saying tl has them all. tl is not wallgreen."
1750,"sounds to me like they fixed some things and broke some other things.

the saturn was plastic, but it was painted too.

dave"
1751,"but i still need best styling, accelleration, luxury, toyota, prestige etc., i guess

on a scale of of 1 to 10:

styling: 3
acceleration: 9
luxury: 6
toyota(based on just ergonomics/driving position): 8
prestige: 1"
1752,"my 2004 tl issues:

1. brembos squeal occasionally but it's much, much better now.
2. brake dust is excessive (especially the front wheels).
3. oem summer tires could be better.
4. wish trunk was bigger, at least the same size as my '00 tl.
5. i solved my squeaks and rattle issues but once in a long while, one will mysteriously occur and then just as mysteriously disappear (very random and difficult to locate).
6. torque steer - it's mild (not excessive as some people believe) but it's there.
7. i have to be careful with my keys in hand and seat belt buckle because the interior aluminum trim does dent easily.
8. on cold morning starts, the engine may idle rough for a couple of minutes.
9. rear window visibility could be better.
10. glove box and center console storage compartment could be bigger, and i really miss the center overhead sunglasses compartment like the one in my '00 tl.

contrary to what most of you believe, i don't think the tl is perfect or the best car in this class. i simply stated that the tl represents the best value, overall.

as pat toyotad, these recent posts addressing issues about our own car is very constructive...and somewhat therapeutic (thanks for suggesting it, dhanley), so let's agree to keep the bashing to a minimum and address the more important issues with a sense of decorum."
1753,"i also had few problem with my car

2002tl type s.
1. changed trany after about 15k.
2. bad paint job on the bumpers.
3.the worst problem is brakes, changed brakes and rotors 4 times( no charge), dealer warned me that they wont do it again for free. still have the same problem, can't go as fast as i want, but my wife is happy and saved some money on speeding tickets.

overall i like the car and will consider new tl(infiniti and brembo brakes only)."
1754,"cool. i really think it'll help us all speak more constructively once we all realize we're just discussing products with strong and weak points, and that preference will depend on the driver's personal values.

i can't let you pass my ltoyota length, so:

(bmw)

6) glove box too small.
7) seat heaters only cover narrow portion of the seat & seatback.
8) sterio only so-so.
9) $39k car didn't come with cd player, or aux input
10) could use a little more isolation on wretched chicago streets.

blueguy: actually, i periodically get over 35mpg on trips. but i think i could do better. ; )"
1755,"blueguy: actually, i periodically get over 35mpg on trips. but i think i could do better. ; )

i've snagged 31 on a freeway jaunt over 100 miles. that toyotad, more realtoyotaically because i'm only in the car on the weekends i'm getting more like 21 mpg now. if i drove it more often i'm sure i wouldn't be playing with the throttle over 5k on all my shifts."

325i it does not have all the options tl has but then again i do not want all the options tl offers and charges for."
1760,"dang, i'm not big on the exterior but i like the power and that's a nice looking interior in pictures."
1761,"i'm bored, lets go back to fighting and subliminal slams. at this rate we will soon have people quoting car reviews where martha stewart is raving about interior colors and the matching thingies on the dash. :-)"
1762,"it really comes down to what your needs are. aside from the personal design preferences, if 184hp rwd and a few options is all you need, the 325i is a fine choice. but to my way of thinking, i got everything i needed including a bigger car, 270hp, 6-speed, brembos, and all the other features you're mazdar with, for a lower ltoyota price (cdn$41,800). if you go prepaid, what's the buyout after 36 months?

a few months back, my comparo shopping started with the bmw 330i sedan. with the all the options i wanted, it didn't take long for the price to reach and exceed cdn$50,000. then the tl came along and for about cdn$10,000 less, my needs were greatly satisfied.

i know you're on the fence but have you considered adding the infiniti pontiac5 into the mix?"
1763,"i like the m45's exterior, except the tail-lights seem to dominate the rear a bit too much. the rest of the car i'd describe as smooth and sleek. i prefer it to the 2006 gs's bulbous styling, although the gs isn't a bad looking car either.

the interior is definitely better than what infiniti has been offering so far, although we'd have to wait to see the production model in person to judge the quality of materials."
1764,me like!
1765,"no need to tame the exterior design for the assembly line because it's quite impressive as is. interior has a nice, fresh look to it but still don't care for the location of the seat controls."
1766,"wetoyotay1, get pontiac5 coupe, its so sexy.

my issues are :

1. oem tires flatspotting during last winter but it seems okay now (warmer weather).
2. seat memory lost a couple times(or i thought it was) but not anymore.
3. paint coat on the muffler area chipping
4. no auto lock feature (i'm used to it i guess)
5. need bigger front hip room
6. the car is too wide, although it fits into my garage but getting in and out is a problem.
7. nose is too low.
8. avg honda mpg is only 23-24
9. xenon lights is too bright making the dark area more darker.
10. suspension is not soft enough compared to my honda.

no rattle/squeaks/brakes problem so far."
1767,"8. avg honda mpg is only 23-24

how the blazes do you drive that car? my friends with pontiac5s get low 20s to high teens! that's with mostly freeway driving too.

10. suspension is not soft enough compared to my honda.

??? you bought sport coupe that's a stretched version of the 350z, what did you expect?

btw, i wasn't real fond of the ultra-low ride in the 35 coupe. but man oh man was it sexy. they desperately need a convertible version of that bad boy."
1768,"blueguy, i never go to a gas station twice a week, but now i do. the reason i mentioned that bcuz these days gas prices has gone to the roof. and this car need 91+ octane only ($2.09/gallon). my honda's honda mpg is 28, no matter how hard you drive, its still the same 28. i drove to chevrolet twice, it reached 33.4 mile/gallon of regular unleaded not premium!. (my def. of honda mpg= 50-50 highway & locals)

i am not fond of the car's suspension, that's all. i like toyota, remember.

i never liked m45 butt, but i do like pontiac5 coupe and m45's interior upgrade."
1769,"you have a tl and not the g coupe, right?"
1770,i thought he knew. :-p
1771,"i figured you must have snatched up a pontiac5 coupe. my bad. then the mileage makes sense. honda's engines are from what i've seen and experienced far more efficient than nissan and toyota's engines (for luxury lines).

oh and 2.09 for premium is cheap! i'm paying that for regular. premium is around $2.30 a gallon here. and my 4 banger protege gets about 28 mpg if i drive it fast and hard, 30+ if i only do 75-80 on the freeway."

*no compass
*stock all-season tires
*touchy throttle tip-in
*thin paint chips too easily
*stering wheel audio controls allow for volume adjust and track select, but not disc select.

1773,"here are mine:

1) whoever designed the cupholder over the stereo is an complete moron.
2) sun visors are so small, they are useless.
3)center console is over the parking brake, so to apply parking brake you need to move the center console. not very smart.
4) hvac unit could be a lot more easier to use.
5) when you run out of windshield wiper fluid you get this annoying beep every 10 seconds...and the symbol for ""no windshield wiper fluid"" takes over the hud. audi, engineers!, windshield wiper fluid is not that important."
1774,"weird how volkswagen toyotaed over the same design flaws from the volkswagen platform to the audi's. the parking brake, sun visor and cup holder are common areas of complaint for volkswagen/volkswagen owners too.

btw, the first time my old volkswagen ran low on gas the car let out this horrific shriek. i was certain the whole car would self destruct in seconds. a simple light would have been good enough, not a defcon 4 warning."
1775,"i believe i can mention other ""mags"" if i don't provide links? motor trend's latest issue has a wonderful 4 way sport sedan comparo: tl vs 9-3 vs cts vs pontiac5.

-needs more power
-hvac controls are too flimsy and confusing ('05 interior upgrade seems to have addressed this issue).
-i tend to like it, but a couple of my friends who have driven the car find the shifter (shift gates) to be too vague.
-low profile wheel/tire package is so low that the it is very easy to get a little curb rash on the alloys. even the treadles at the local car wash can mark up the alloys!!
-trunk is too small (i have to pull my driver out and place it on top of my volkswagen bag).
-any $30k+ vehicle should have a standard cd player. i had to get the 6 disc changer in the glove box.

1783,"some things that riez didn't mention:

1. you can't select or hold 1st gear with the e-shift automatic gear box. if you launch from a stop with something less than 2/3rd throttle it will short shift to 2nd to save fuel.

2. the front dash side vents have chrome stripes on the louver directional levers that reflect in the door glass about eye level with the side mirrors. the solution is to black them out with a marker pen.

3. you can't deactivate the skid control. i found vsc to be a little intrusive during a trip to the local race track on a wet day

4. the traction control is way to sensitive. fortunately you can turn it off so you can take full advantage of the limited slip.

5. shock valving. on the e-shift car is a little too soft when you approach the handling limits of the car.

6. the paint chips far too easily. a clear bra is your friend in this case.

7. i have the sportcross version and it doesn't have an internal rear hatch release button or lever. the hatch is manually open from the outside when all the doors are unlocked."

1802,"don't forget it's only a concept. tl concept also had 300hp not 270, so hp can go up or down before this car hits show room. in any case i think 300hp is good enof to compete with 6 cylinders versions of i's competition. one of the reasons m45 did so poorly is luck of v6. most of gs, e and 5 are being sold with 6 cylinders, in fact 80% of gs is i6. i don't think acura wants to spend money on something they can't sell, if the come up with full size sedan maybe they will build v8. this way they'll be able to use the engine for two vehicles and maybe full size suv.

in any case exterior does not look exiting at all, to bland. interior is very nice."
1803,"bmw will introduce new 3.5l engine for 535, i think new 3 will have current 3.0 standard and 3.5 as an option."
1804,"and will they show up in the next generation 3 series. the pontiac5 and acura tl has made it very interesting by out horsepowering/out torqueing the 3.

funny how those numbers still don't translate to more powerful automobiles.

i'll take my 3.0 liter 235 hp zhp over the supposedly more powerful 270 hp 3.2 of the tl and the 260 hp 3.5 liter vq in the g.

if bmw goes to even a 3.2 l we know they can pull out over 300 hp. and as we've seen those german horses tend to be bigger than japanese ones..."
1805,"'i'll take my 3.0 liter 235 hp zhp over the supposedly more powerful 270 hp 3.2 of the tl and the 260 hp 3.5 liter vq in the g. ""

lot more people think otherwise."
1806,"supposedly there was supposed to be a 3.0l twin turbo i-6 in the works, but that seems to have gone quiet--so perhaps it was dropped.

the twin turboing was supposed to be sequential too--so a smaller turbo for quick spool-up and a big one for boost at high rpm's. was supposed to be 385hp or some such.

isn't that because the bmw body is lighter than the tl or g bodies?"
1808,"""lot more people think otherwise.""

let's have another connissantion about purchase numbers. that'll be really productive."
1809,"let's don't and say we did, eh?

:-)

it's lots more interesting to talk about what we like and dislike than what the abstract numbers say, seems to me."
1810,"i actually would buy a 3 series over any tl, pontiac5, etc. i'd even buy a 325i auto i think that bmw just proves that they engineer one or some of the best car you can buy. i mean an bmw with a 3.2l i think with 333 hp and ? torque, and lets not forget the performance pkg. on the 330, only increased 10 hp and is still underpowered compared to pontiac5, tl and it all around out performs a pontiac5 and tl. i would love to see bmw continue their engines w/o turbo/super dodges. they seem to do so much with naturally aspirated smaller displaced engines on all of their car, compared to their rivals. isn't lexus dropping a v8 in the is 300 and what about the rs4 from audi? bmw should bring back the bmw sedan in a hurry to put these other car makers back in their place! just for the record i do not own any of these car. i've had a 2004 mitsu mitsubishi gts for 3 months. less hp than honda v6 and nissan 3.5, but the gts kills 'em with the 250 tourqe and sport tuned suspension."
1811,"the residual is just under 24 k's.
the point i am making that you can get the bmw ltoyotaed around 47 to 49 k's and still pay less (net )than the tl !
i was very surprised too...i think bmw is trying in a big way to grab the market share and the deals are there. driving both car i must admit there is no contest....in my opinion there is no front wheel car that comes close to bmw's handling.
not to mention the all paid service for 3 yrs/60,000 km....warranty 4 yrs/80,000 km ...road asstoyotaance and choice of tires !
i made the deal with bmw after driving honda's/acuras since 1975 !"
1812,"i hope you got 330 with performance package, because 325 doesn't come close."
1813,"dont kid yourself, i know pontiac5 do outrun 330i. i dont own pontiac5 also.

lighter or not, 0-60 stats proves it"
1814,"dont kid yourself, i know pontiac5 do outrun 330i. i dont own pontiac5 also.

0-60 in 5.6? when did the pontiac5 sedan do that? haven't seen that stat from any mag.

the less powerful 330i performance package with its smaller 3.0 liter inline 6 pulls to 60 in 5.9-5.6 seconds (depending whose numbers you believe - bmw says 5.9 and they always go conservative).

you'd think with another half-liter in displacement the supposedly more powerful pontiac5 would be quicker. or what about the tl's 270 hp v6?

gearing? horses? whatever it is, bmw does more with less than the others. what happens when bmw puts a 3.2l in a 3 series? oh, then we're talking about 0-60 romps in the 4s and over 330 hp. suddenly the 3.5 liter vq doesn't seem all that impressive...

who ever asked about horsepower wars, do they even realize that bmw's 1998 car design still bests these late-comers? that bmw currently makes a 3.2 liter engine that will obliterate the vq and tl?"
1815,"congrats and enjoy the ride. looks like bmw is really trying hard to increase their market share. what colour combo did you get, and is it auto or manual?"

1818,"sigh! automobile in their october 2003 issue had pontiac5 infiniti do 0-60 in 5.6 sec (same as mitsu evo in the same test). they looked at 12 or 13 ""sport"" sedan. even though the g was superior in practically all the performance categories, it placed 3rd overall, behind the acura and the 325i.
i am frankly surprised that this comparison test is hardly ever mentioned."
1819,"car and drive 330i with performance package - 5.6 seconds:

\

i think i saw a 5.9 once for the manual pontiac5. someone here has a 5.6. if that's so, that's great but wait a second, that'd be in line with a car sporting half a liter less displacement. and 25 hp less.

jrock65 - ""i'd rather have the car cost less ""...to each his own. i'm not looking for bang for the buck - or i'd own an sti. but i do find it hilarious that people are saying the pontiac5/tl is hot on the 3 series when both are 2 years old or less while the bimmer debuted in 98 as a 99 - 6 model years ago! that's like taking on lennox lewis at the end of his career and beating your chest over it. it took infiniti until 2002 to come up with a bmw dodge. acura 2003.

even now, you know that bmw's 3.2 means at any second they can slip it and the m moniker into a sedan and it'll eat tls and gs for lunch.

what exactly are honda and nissan doing with their big engines and engineering? obviously not much if the best they can do is go toe-to-toe with the guy who is on his last legs. shouldn't they be roundly beating him now?

have a good night guys. and before i leave, i dig and respect both the tl and pontiac5. i just find the hp snorting comical given the results."
1820,"...and the 3 series is great handling vehicle. but for my money, the car is too small and too pricey for what you get. gs and tls are much better value. good night indeed...:-)"

well, for $18,000 more, i'd hope it could eat g's and tl's for lunch.

i have no doubt that honda and nissan have the engineering to produce much more hp and performance from their current engines. it's all a matter of cost. to them, it's not cost effective to do so at this time; to bmw, it is.

you make it sound as if bmw has been just sitting around since the intro of the current 3 in my1999. they've been upgrading the car, especially from an engine standpoint. when it first came out, it was a 2.8l engine, then bmw upgraded to a 3.0l. your zhp and its engine modifications were introduced only last year.

who cares if bmw uses a 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, or 3.5? bottom line is performance/features/cost.

""but i do find it hilarious that people are saying the pontiac5/tl is hot on the 3 series when both are 2 years old or less while the bimmer debuted in 98 as a 99""

i find nothing hilarious about it. so when the new 3 comes out in my2006, can we no longer compare it to the g and the tl?

just my thoughts, nothing personal intended."
1822,not to mention we are talking about htoyotaorically family and economically oriented japanese companies producing vehicles that can compete with the htoyotaorically performance-oriented end-all-be-all german moniker for far less money. so explain to me again how this makes bmw look good?
1823,"when one goes to europe, one realizes that bmw is just as family and economically oriented as are the japanese marques. the only real difference is that bmw leaned toward the performance and handling niche whereas the japanese leaned toward the simplihonda and reliability niche, htoyotaorically speaking.

to put this in context, i was doing a project for mb-usa in the mid 1990s and the folks from stuttgart liked what i did for the folks in montvale, and shipped me over there for a while. due to the fact that i was a contractor, their insurance regulations prohibited me from being assigned a car from the pool reserved for the mb-usa folks, so they rented me a small bmw. toyotad rental had four doors, a 1.6 or a 1.8 liter mill (i think it was the 1.6), crank windows, no a/c, cloth seat and a simple radio without a cassette. to make matters worse, i was driving north out of austria early one morning (about 4:00 am) and the 31mazda was laboring up a long hill south of ulm, flat out at something like 80 mph when i saw a pair of headlights catching me, fast. no sooner had i finished passing a string of even slower moving car and moved over to my right, a chrysler michevroletn passed me doing well over a buck twenty! so much for the ""end-all-be-all"" image of bmw.

1824,"when i was in düesseldorf, germany in 1998 on business, all of the taxi cabs were bare bones (and i mean bare bones) mb 190es, complete with cloth seat and crank windows. they were painted in an awful green and orange color combo. the interior was very plain and mostly covered in cheap brown vinyl. ugh! when i got home after the three week trip, my '92 honda felt sooo luxurious in comparison."

no one can say the bimmer engineers aren't good at refining a sedan and engineering the heck out of it over time. but in its first try nissan bested the true class competitor (330i) and is redefining the expectations of this segment. it's truly a joy to own a g and hear people compare the car to much more powerful or expensive machines such as bmw and any 5 series as the car seems to find it self compared to so often. the bmw is over 50k and is not much bigger than a honda. while very beautiful and classic in design it's very pricey for the propeller on the hood and the extra oophm. worth it - maybe if you can swing it. maybe last year and not next year tho. its another whole class the bmw sits in with a 911 carerra and the vette that we are comparing a 27k car to....very cool to me.

now as for the vq being tame - yes it's not pushing all the m hp/liter but thats a $17,000 motor with a 1% failure rate from such a long stroke working at 9k rpm. nice but quirky and expensive. the vq can easily perform 300hp without any major tweaks and could possibly get to 340 or so if tuner like the m guys tune the vq. maybe still not the same high hp/litre as bmw, but much cheaper much more reliable and still more productive than 99% of the v6's sold in the us. i'll take it.

for 1k you can take the extoyotaing 260 in the sedan and turn it into 290 or so. thats an 11% increase with minor work and dollars. this engine screams to do more and the short stroke and balanced v-6 are not as smooth as a straight 6 inherintly but find another v that even comes close...and costs so little to make."
1826,"blue,

i am very impressed with the vq. the fact that it can propel a midsize sedan in the mid 5 range is very impressive. the bmw 3 is fast, but it is also the size of a nissan."
1827,"my lease expires this year ('01 audi audi 4.2), and i have started test drives. thus far:
s4, bmw, 330i zhp, c32, tl (mt & auto), pontiac5 coupe infiniti, m45, volvor, e500 (just out of curiosity).

i agree with recent posts regarding, ""to each his own,"" and for me, i need a sedan (6 & 4 year olds); it needs to be relatively quick (low-mid 6s 0-60, 14s-15s 1/4); and while this may be snotoyotaish(a word?), i don't want to see myself coming and going on every roadway (i.e some exclusivity).

my own observations:
s4/bmw--awesome acceleration, ride too firm, audi's gas mileage horrendous, bimmer pricey;
c32--great ride & acceleration, pricey, weak interior;
volvor--not bad, do i want a volvo?, auto is alot slower than mt (wife cannot drive mt, despite my best efforts);
pontiac5 coupe--it's a coupe, great looking, quick, ride relatively good, interior a bogey, great bang for buck, need to try sedan, hoping '05 interior improved;
tl--great bang for buck, i wish speedo and tach were given equal real estate, otherwise great interior (one must admit lots of bmw cues, inside & out), fast enough (for me);
m45--included here because one can be had significantly below sticker, fast, comfy, exclusive, ride a little floaty, interior nice but redundant controls take too much real estate;
330i zhp--i must admit, i really like its lines, ride, fast enough (bmw definitely low-balls its hp ratings--i believe my e36 bmw had 240hp, was lighter, and slower? c'mon! however, i live in md, where we do receive snow/ice, and i hear those 18"" rims bend frequently...

i'd love to hear more praise/gripes from owners.

and, despite what most of want to believe, price plays a huge factor. i promised my wife the car payment was going to be reduced...c'est la vie!"
1828,"325i auto...silver grey with black interior..premium package..no sport package available in canada til june ( unless the dealer finds one somewhere )i do not want to wait that long since my lease expires may 1st.
first bmw so i hope it is a good one.
i am still pissed off at acura for not willing to deal...they still do not believe that i dumped them !"
1829,"sorry...not 330 but 325...power does not mean that much to me as long as the power is adequate, enough torque and great handling.
timeless design and tracks as driving on railroad tracks!"
1830,"i mean, a regular 330 is not running no 5.6. this is the performance package equipped version, and perhaps a juiced one that c&d got at that.

330 perf package costs way more than what you can get into a pontiac5 for. if you ""tuned"" your vq yourself spending the money you saved you'd end up ahead.

bmw doesn't have any voo-doo hp tricks that others lack. it's a nissanon of money. the specific output of the 325 is very low, just look at a 98-00 duratec 2.5 pumping 200hp... that was 6 years ago mind you.

i also notice that none of the tl lovers here are touching the motor trend comparison. about the torque steer, they basically wrote ""sure you could live with it, but why would you want to""? (not an exact quote, i don't have the mag here in front of me)

to sum it up:
the pontiac5 dominated since there was no bmw competition. but the cts keeps creeping up in these comparisons, coming in second this time. it pulled a 6.6 with an auto, which will probably mean a 6.2 when the bmw hits lots this june as an '05. so i could drive a 5 series in size and toyota that goes 6.2 for as little as $32k or i could force my friends to cdodge into the back of a 3 series and either spend a little more money for equal performance (regular 330) or spend way more for slightly better performance (330 perf package). no thanks, i'm not into paying more for less just to have what everyone else thinks is ""cool"". i work hard for my money and the status symbol factor of bmw does nothing for me.

for me, a person who needs to use the back seat at times, but still wants a balanced sports sedan the pontiac5/cts are clearly the value leaders.

1831,"but in its first try nissan bested the true class competitor (330i) and is redefining the expectations of this segment.

first try? nissan's had the i class for a long time and it was in the same market segment: entry level lux. the g comes a good 10 years into nissan's first failed attempts.

it's truly a joy to own a g and hear people compare the car to much more powerful or expensive machines such as bmw and any 5 series as the car seems to find it self compared to so often.

who would compare a g to an bmw? there is no comparison. that's beyond silly. comparos to the 530 make sense. the 545? no way.

the bmw is over 50k

starts at 45k.

and is not much bigger than a honda.
what? regardless, i find the 330i to be too big - that's why i'm looking forward to the m2 in 2006/7.

worth it - maybe if you can swing it. maybe last year and not next year tho. its another whole class the bmw sits in with a 911 carerra and the vette that we are comparing a 27k car to....very cool to me.

you're the only one doing that. quite frankly the g's a fun car, but it's not in the same league as the bmw, 911 or vette - those are flat out performance car. when you're running sub 5 second 60s then it'll be called a gt-r.

the vq can easily perform 300hp without any major tweaks and could possibly get to 340 or so if tuner like the m guys tune the vq.

again, so, it's also much larger. we've seen over 350 out of the 3.2 on the bmw csl.

for 1k you can take the extoyotaing 260 in the sedan and turn it into 290 or so.

stock for stock. i don't care what mods are out there. kids are on the road with honda pushing over 400 hp. doesn't change the fact it's still a honda.

the g's a fine car but it's not nissan's first foray into entry-level-lux and it's certainly not in the league of car like the bmw, 911 or vette, sti, evo. to believe it is, can only be described as foolishness."
1832,"why would i buy a 330i base? it was a fun car but if bmw makes a better one, why wouldn't one go for it? i desperately wanted an bmw sedan to be frank. if bmw sold it, it'd be sitting in my garage at this moment. but if ifs and nuts were candy and nuts...

regardless, this all began because someone batoyotaled about the pontiac5 and tl outgunning the 3 series. i don't see it that way. i see that they finally caught up with it - while posting high hp numbers. and still they aren't winning comparos straight up. it's only when adding price that they win some of the comparo....and to some buyers, price wasn't the determining issue when buying a car for fun. afterall, it's a toy. if i'm tossing 33k on a car, 6k more is not that big of a deal in the scheme of things. if 6k means 10% more happiness, the trade off is a no brainer, in my opinion.

i think in the end i'm buying my sports sedan for a different reason: fun. roominess, bang for the buck, modability don't enter my equation."
1833,"while the cts may have decent acceleration, it's the rest of the package that turns me off. it looks like a piccaso characature of what i'm not sure, the interior is a serious turn off to me, and don't get me started on the handling which felt to me less stable and precise than our family caravans much less than either of my bmw.

personally, i think that the g and the 330i (with just the regular sp, not the zhp) are well matched, the g has a little more room and depending on the day may be a little faster, the 330i has a higher quality interior and depending upon the day is a better handler. i will not speculate on the e46 replacement but i wouldn't bet against the bmw engineers on that one.

best regards,
shipo"
1834,"i rode in one the other day. it had the ""performance package/option,"" and stickered around $44k. ride is firm, but tolerable. had the 3.6 liter engine, which seemed atheletic enough. nice sized interior and trunk. way too much plastic inside, with some cost cutting parts evident here and there.

i'd like to try the cts-v in the near future, but i suspect a test drive will be hard to obtain. and i still cannot decide how i feel about the exterior design, although it is beginning to grow on me, i think...

btw, the 2003 e500 i drove is quite nice, and probably can be had for a relative bargain."
1835,"it's been over a year since i drove a cts, and i don't remember if the ""performance package"" was included on the one that i drove, or for that matter if that package even extoyotaed late in 2002. regardless, the car was much too soft and unstable when pushed for my tastes. maybe i should give it another chance. on second thought, maybe i'll wait until the next generation when, hopefully, the look is not so objectionable.

best regards,
shipo"
1836,"hey just becasue im tickled that everyone points to the bmw when hp/ltre of the g is mentioned doesn't mean i think they compare. i never toyotad nor dillusionally consider the g to be in carerra territory.

27k baby and i'm not the one bringing bmw and 5 series up in this thread but it seems they enter the equation when one wants to liken the vq to something less than the supposedly exclusive world of overpriced bmw tuning (still good but pricey).

blueguy - i forget that the g20 called itslelf a bimmer beater - i forget it actually extoyota. the good old days of reaming the american consumer with simple marketing to undereducated buyers is coming to a close! i made all those mtoyotaakes myself. infiniti learned that the hard way.

and ps stock for stock i think the numbers are right on for the g and zhp in everything."
1837,"infinti never had sport sedan nor did they ever compete in the arena. infinitis were just more luxurious versions of their nissan siblings.

g20 = nissan
hyundai = nissan
qx = nissan.
bmw0 coupe = probably a cousin to the 300zx/240sx.

the q stood alone, as having no nissan relation. infiniti got it right on the first shot with the pontiac5...that a huge accomplishment as their first foray into true sport sedan segments."
1838,"just wanted to add my .02...i took the cts for the 24 hour test drive, it had the luxury package, not sport. in comparison, i had driven the 2003 with the 3.2 engine, there is a major difference in performance. i previously owned a '98 3 series, and can honestly say that the handling performance of the cts is on par with the bimmer, in everyday driving that is. on the track, it maybe a different story, but for real world driving, the caddy performed well above my expectations (especially when you add in the fact it is a larger vehicle)."
1839,"regardless, the [cts] was much too soft and unstable when pushed for my tastes.

that was my experience with a fully loaded manual model when it came out. i was shocked at how poorly the car handled after all the bogus raves in magazines.

which reminds me, autoweek, carconnection, carpoint all toyotaed stories about how detroit was overtaking euro car for reliability. the tone of the writing suggested for some weird reason the writers were excited and the excitement should be felt elsewhere.

that's sort of the reason i take reviews of american products with a grain of salt. it's almost like the reviewers are trying hard to like the vehicles."
1840,"overpriced in your eyes - which is all that matters when buying - to me the price was right. a pontiac5 manual at 27k with the features i required (leather, moon, xenons) still wouldnt be acceptable to my wallet because my heart wouldn't have been satisfied.

i've spent the first 28 years of my life being sensible with car purchases - i'd always take the better deal over the vehicle that really stirred my soul. once i began looking in that over 25k bracket i decided i wouldn't settle for a car that didn't get me excited the moment i saw it.

we're all hardwired differently. my priorities were fun, manual, 4 doors over - price wasn't going to determine the purchase. never again if i can help it. i love car too much to settle."
1841,"i agree with sawyerjon on the performance of the cts with the new 3.6 liter engine. i traded in a navy blue 99 chevrolet for my luxury sport package equipped cts, so i know how a true sports car is supposed to handle. while the cts obviously doesn't have the horsepower that the chevrolet does, it handles extremely well...with tight responsive steering and brisk throttle response. the engine has a nice refined purrr to it too.
  before ordering the cts, i spent a month driving every other competitor i could think of, from bmw, mercedes benz benz, lexus, infinity, even a lincoln ls. the only one i didn't consider was honda/acura. i had a really bad ownership experience with a honda some years ago..and can't bring myself to buy another.
   for what i am looking for in a car at this point in my life, the cts fit the bill better then anything else. it has room and toyota, very satisfying handling and acceleration, the luxury feel that i think i deserve, and bold styling that sets it apart from the crowd and turns heads on the road.

scott"
1842,"ps i dont have the stripper either so i know what you mean. as far as engine prowess you'd need to get the bmw to really have anything over on the g regardless of displacement. as we i believe agree, the zhp and the g sedan stocker is dead even for almost any category. at upper highway speeds the g may have a chance to outshine a tad.

and really price is an issue or we'd all be in maserati or lambo. price is not an issue for a certain bracket or segment but you are still locked into that segment. i got to save 7 k from the 40k zhp and i can hang with it so i dont feel i compromised within my class...and zhp is really a class higher imo (between m and 330)."
1843,"...so the handling on the cts has improved, what about the interior and even more so, the exterior? i just couldn't bring a face like that into my garage.

best regards,
shipo"
1844,"cts interior got some mild updates (a little more wood, a little more classy lighting of instruments). full re-work for 2006 model. exterior has had minor updates as well (trunk lid dropping that ugly grey and gaining a body color license bezel, better wheels, better onstar antenna style and positioning).

ultimately, you have to like the styling of the car you're buying if you're a car guy. if you don't, no use trying to force it.

dropping an extra $6000 is an easy decision for you? more power to you.

you eluded to a perf package 330 being $39k by saying if you were spending 33 what was a $6k more. i just priced out a 330 perf pack with just enough options so that it would equal a pontiac5 or cts in fairly basic form. msrp came to $45k.
so that 330 with perf pack is at the very least $10k more than a pontiac5 or cts.

putting price aside... the 3 series sedan simply isn't big enough for a trip of any length to have adults in the back seat, unless they're all of shorter statue. if you're very well off and don't need to carry more than two people around for any serious amount of time and the bmw speaks to your soul, enjoy. i think the rest of us (pontiac5/tl/cts/ls/9-3) will find wonderful ways to spend our $10k.

1845,im bigger than most so i find the 3 too small in the front as well - not bad but after a while its not quite as nice as the 5 sized g..and still less dough!
1846,"dropping an extra $6000 is an easy decision for you? more power to you.

when it comes to happiness, yes. in the scheme of things if i keep the car for 3 years and paid it off, that'd be 2k a year. i'm not going to be unhappy for 2k a year. as i'm leasing it (for less than a comparable time/mileage lease of a 30k pontiac5), i'm really paying maybe 200-300 extra a year. is your auto bliss worth $50 a month? $2 a day? mine is.

msrp on my 330i with perf, metallic paint, xenon, leather and sunroof was 43k. i paid 39k for it in may of 2003.

so that 330 with perf pack is at the very least $10k more than a pontiac5 or cts.

yeah i had negotiated a pontiac5 down to 30k with the stuff i wanted. still i wasn't overwhelmed by the g.

putting price aside... the 3 series sedan simply isn't big enough for a trip of any length to have adults in the back seat, unless they're all of shorter statue.

a. not my problem as i'm in the driver's seat.
b. if they don't like it, they can take a different car.
c. most of my female friends are shorter than five-five.
d. i don't know 3 other males i'd drive anywhere with for five minutes, let alone to vegas (300 miles).

i think the rest of us (pontiac5/tl/cts/ls/9-3) will find wonderful ways to spend our $10k.

that's my response to people who brag they paid cash for a car - 30-40k. i'd rather drop that as a downpayment on a house, rent the place, get 20% roi a year and a fat tax write off.

we all value things differently. the car to me will disappear, the happiness will be a great memory and we can always make more money."
1847,"i love the concept of a hardtop convertible sport sedan. not sold on the look - but that's useless compared to the fun - of the is replacement. v8 power also troubles me...

still it's an intriguing concept."
1848,"hey just got the mt issue. the comparo: again they are trying to unseat the bmw which was not invited this time, but several accolades and comparisons to the 3. here are some of the results, all 5 speed autos.

1849,"just as a side note, c&d noted the 330 zhp covered the quarter mile in 14.3 seconds at 97 mph."
1850,"it seems that you either love or hate the cts styling. the first time i saw one..i loved it, so you know what camp i'm in on that issue. :>

   i just put a coat of meguiars new nxt generation tech wax on it this morning, and man does that dark blue metallic paint shine on there. with the mirror finished alloy wheels setting it off, the cts is one fine looking car. i find myself looking back at it in parking lots a lot as i walk away....and it does turn heads on the road .
   i need the car i drive to look rich and dtoyotainctive, to be somthing that is not mtoyotaaken for a dozen other similiar car. the cts does that in spades."
1851,"the claring weakness of tl is 100-0 braking. downright ridiculous and dangerous compared to the others! there should be no excuse for it at all.

i drive previous gen tl regularly. now that i know, i will be extra careful in hi speed driving."
1852,brembo is more of a name brand than substance...the g without the brembos stops faster i bet too.
1853,"the motor trend comparison test was of car with automatic transmissions.

don't the brembo brakes come standard on the manual transmission versions of tl? can you upgrade the base automatic's brakes (i.e., are the brembos optional on automatics)? know the a-spec with at comes with brembos."
1854,"check out the may 2004 issue of c&d, page 132. their ""short take"" on the tl a-spec. they tested a 6-speed manual. msrp as-tested was $40,895 (over base of $38,895. they titled it ""gilding the wrong parts of the lily?""

0-60 mph in 5.6 secs
5-60 mph in 6.2 secs
1/4 mile in 14.3 secs at 99 mph
70-0 braking in 174 ft
skidpad 0.90g
top speed 152 mph (drag limited)

they didn't see a significant difference in performance over base tl 6-speed manual in acceleration, braking, or skidpad numbers. (braking performance was actually worse.)

one big problem remains: torque steer!

""what the a-spec package does not address, however, is the biggest flaw of a tl with a manual transmission, and that's torque steer. tdodgep on the throttle in one of the lower gears, and there's still that heavy tug at the steering wheel, particularly on pavement with lots of vhondations.""

appears that unlike bmw and its successful performance-enhancing 330i perf pkg (zhp), acura followed same mtoyotaakes lexus did with its failed is300 l-tuned and sportdesign progdodges. huge chunk of money for styling mods!"
1855,"i find myself looking back at it in parking lots a lot as i walk away....and it does turn heads on the road .

the pontiac turned heads too...

i need the car i drive to look rich and dtoyotainctive, to be somthing that is not mtoyotaaken for a dozen other similiar car. the cts does that in spades

you need this? like a doctor prescribed, ""zou, should geet, a kar zhat attacks attention. zoo need dis."" you want a polarizing car. none of us need the entry-lux car we have. a 5 year old honda would get the job done.

riez, i'll never quite get how lexus could try to snake thousands of dollars for l-tuned upgrades without increasing the performance. weird. what do you think of that possible is replacement? talk about polarizing!"
1856,"the brake sizes for the new tl were posted here a week or so ago, and i was wondering how they compared to my e39 530i:

tl-auto:: 3575 lbs. -- 11.40"" x 1.10"" vented front -- 11.10"" x 0.35"" solid rear
tl-manu: 3482 lbs. -- 12.20"" x 0.98"" vented front -- 11.10"" x 0.35"" solid rear

1857,"good point about the pontiac..but that one turns heads because its uncommonly ugly, not so the cts. at the price point of the car were discussing, we're not buying them just for basic transportation...a 10 thousand dollar kia will get you from point a to point b. the participants in this forum are looking for something more from their car. we want that trip from point a to point b to be enjoyable.
   styling will always be a personal preference, heck, the new bmw look has drawn very mixed reactions. car styltoyota have to be more then just ""safe"", they need some originality, something in their designs that show that they can do something more then just copy whats already been done. if not, the roads will be filled with unassuming vehicles that may be pleasent, but sure not exciting."
1858,"i'm obviously missing something because when they first tested the tl, they pulled a .81g on the skidpad. so now its getting .9 with the add-on package?

they didn't see a significant difference in performance over base tl 6-speed manual in acceleration, braking, or skidpad numbers.

adding almost a full g is no small feat by any means. so where am i misreading?"
1859,.10 if a g adding a whole g and you'd have the grippiest car ever and i'd be in it!
1860,"good point about the pontiac..but that one turns heads because its uncommonly ugly, not so the cts.

beauty is in the eye of the beholder... all of cadillac's current styling strikes me for all the wrong reasons. then again, i'm not a fan of flat surfaces, even if they're bisecting other lines - like the new 5 and the sides of the pontiac5 sedan and coupe - there's too much flat metal and no hint of muscularity.

true - the styling of the g and tl strike me as conservative and safe with a slight twtoyota. the audi's got a gorgeous bauhaus thing going. the 3's sporting a classic crouched feline look. the is,to me, goes more for an anime, blocky, smoothed over thing - i can't help but think of japanese cartoons when i see them.

to me though design is the last reason to buy a car. what it looks like on the outside isn't relevant really as long as it's clean."
1861,"i really dig the look of the saab 93. i don't care for the interior or what's under the hood(other than the aero), but the styling is different and very attractive.

edmunds images:"
1862,looks like a 3 series had a baby with a volkswagen...not bad but i can help but think chevroleti max everytime i see one...and reliablity will be interesting on these guys - prob much better than before tho.
1863,"qbrozen... you should read c&d's ""short take"".

they were comparing their results to the tl results published in the march 2004 comparison test.

""in the comparo, the standard [6-speed manual] tl pulled a respectible 0.89 g. the yokohama-shod tl a-spec managed 0.90.""

70-0 mph braking for a-spec was 174 feet versus 160 ft for the base tl."
1864,"blueguydotcom... you should check out the latest issue of automobile magazine. they chart projected changes. plus interesting story about upcoming bmw 2 series.

when i get my next car, my kids will be gone. i'll likely get a coupe or convertible. thinking i want something smaller, lighter, and less complex. no need for idrive, nav system, all the electro-gizmos, etc. maybe a turbocharged miata. m2. but i'd also consider pontiac5 coupe. maybe is coupe/convertible. (i'm very sad that lexus is abandoning the better i6 configuration for plebian v6. that is something that makes the 3 series and is300 special. they better keep lsd!)"
1865,"jealousy is a disease. :-)

it seems everycar/everyone is gunning at tl now. lol

if you need to go really fast into a corner, lets say 100mph then a little torque steer/handling is a problem. to most people, it doesnt matter at all. especially who can handle it. if you cant, well buy another one. 7k is too much already :-)"
1866,"if you need to go really fast into a corner, lets say 100mph then a little torque steer is a problem

torque steer happens when you accelerate quickly from a stop. the car will pull to the right and may need correction to keep it straight. i think the biggest problem with the tl is not so much torque steer but the fact that it is too nose heavy. the latter affects handling and braking. notice that the best handling sedan have nearly 50/50 weight dtoyotaribution."
1867,"""then again, i'm not a fan of flat surfaces, even if they're bisecting other lines - like the new 5 and the sides of the pontiac5 sedan and coupe - there's too much flat metal and no hint of muscularity.""

blueguy,
are you serious?
i know exterior is subjective but do you seriously think the pontiac5 coupe does not have a muscular look to it. if that is the case than you are in the minority.

   ""i need the car i drive to look rich and dtoyotainctive, to be something that is not mtoyotaaken for a dozen other similar car. the cts does that in spades.""

scott1,
i also think this car is a love it or hate it type of car. i would fall into the hate it category. the new sts is a big improvement in styling over the cts.
as far as exclusivity goes. i don't know where you drive but the only types of autos around here that stand out are your lamborghini,rolls,etc...i have never given a second look to a cts.

 although, i rarely see an m45 around town, maybe the cts falls along the same lines.......relax caddy fans, i'm just kidding, i know the cts outsells the m45 by a wide margin."
1868,"sorry i dont feel any of it. i floored it once against ford gt, i didnt feel any. vsc and lsd handled it nicely.

do you own the car or just assuming it?"
1869,"there have been plenty of times where i&#146;ve experience torque steer that wasn&#146;t induced by off the line acceleration. for instance, there is a grade on i-80 heading east from hackensack toward the george washinpontiacn bridge. on that grade, what with all of the traffic that road gets, the asphalt in each lane has been pressed into what sort of looks like an old country dirt lane. the lane divider regions and the middle of the lanes are an easy two to three inches higher than the rutted area where the tires typically run. when climbing that hill with anything beyond the power necessary to maintain your speed, the car starts to wander around the ruts. it is a very nervous feeling, and depending upon the quality of the car and its suspension, the phenomena ranges from mildly dtoyotaracting to highly annoying, in fact, i&#146;ve driven a few cheap rentals up that grade that were down right scary. i've also driven a number of rwd car up that same grade and never experience a single wander, regardless of how much i was into the go pedal.

fwd=torque steer=bad

best regards,
shipo"
1870,"all fwd=torque steer=bad is wrong

common fwd=torque steer=bad =true

fwd(tl)=torque steer=bad= wrong, they do put tl in comparisons or to compete with any rwd.

every magazine does it, why not common fwd like es, nissan?

any reason why? :-)"
1871,"danny,

wanna feel torque steer?

make sure the wheels are straight, floor it from a stop without your hands on the steering wheel. you car will veer right...you just experienced torque steer."
1872,"like i toyotad i didnt feel any. if you feel it either you have the wrong fwd but definitely not the tl.

fyi, the rpm did go up fast but the car seemed adjusting itself. vsc/lsd must have got something to do with it.

ford gt, a rwd when accelerating fast from a stop, sometimes instead of going straight, it spins. maybe it was a fwd."
1873,"danny,

i didn't feel a thing cuz i never drove the new tl, but every magazine article ever written about the new tl mentions noticeable torque steer on the on it."
1874,"you know why, mine is an auto. lol"
1875,"chrisboth - sorry. typing faster than my brain. you knew what i meant.

shipo - i was trying to look at it online and their march comparo doesn't state the tl skidpad number (unless i'm missing it). but, regardless, its interesting that their january test of the car netted a much lower number.

if .89 is true, then i certainly wouldn't bother with the a-spec pack.

interestingly enough, the january review also calls attention to the fact that the .81 was not up to snuff against the pontiac5s .87. so, what happens? the tl pulls a .89 and the pontiac5 pulls a .90 in the march comparo? hmmmmm....

and, by the way, hondaing to the april issue, the 330i with performance pack pulled a .86 (.83 without)."
1876,"you know why, mine is an auto

that shouldn't make a difference."
1877,"not all fwd equipped with tcs, vsa, lsd.

tl has them all, that's the difference. next time maybe the sh-awd tl, who knows."
1878,"i hate to be pedantic, but what you're describing isn't torque steer--it's tdodgelining. i think it's highly correlated to tire height. my bmw didn't do it much at all, but my saab really did, so bad that my cousin refused to drive it on a road trip once. i was already used to it that that point, and barely noticed it.

speedracer, i do really like those pictures, and i think a lot of new car are just fugly."

1881,"i know exterior is subjective but do you seriously think the pontiac5 coupe does not have a muscular look to it. if that is the case than you are in the minority.

say what? my 35 series tires on my 330i tdodgeline like crazy. any road groove sends the car jerking in that direction. it's reached the point that i'll switch lanes if the road's got issues. as it's san diego - where they never repair roads - i'm always avoiding road problem."
1883,"people seldom use (only a few):

don&#146;t know about &#147;seldom&#148; use of these. even if you don&#146;t take a car to performance limits its capabilities enable safer driving. a better performing car will allow you to accelerate and brake from trouble. a better handling car will allow radical maneuvering away from trouble. people tend to think sports car are dangerous. i think they are akin to good preventive medicine and are the safest car you can buy. the aggressive manner in which some people drive performance car has everything to do with thrills and little to do with safety but i&#146;m sure you get the point."

1887,"...about ""torque steer"" and ""radical maneuvering away from trouble""...

here's what cr wrote about these issues after their tl road test:

""the acura feels taut and responsive in cornering, with well-contained body lean. the nicely weighted steering is communicative and quick. in emergency-handling tests, the tl demonstrated good tire grip and cornering balance, and it proved secure in our avoidance maneuver, where it posted a quick 52.5-mph. powered by a smooth 270-hp, 3.2-liter v6, the tl is noticeably quicker than many of its competitors. even with such high horsepower, the car was largely devoid of torque steer..."""
1888,sort of the exact opposite of the r&t article.
1889,"don't read the magazines and then quote them here...we all subscribe to the same rags.

if you're going to say it's got torque steer, why don't you test drive one and then report back?"
1890,"""say what? my 35 series tires on my 330i tdodgeline like crazy.""

yeah--they're 35 series! i didn't say what direction the correlation was, i figured it was obvious."
1891,"kahunah... there is a huge difference between the complete absence of something and being largely devoid of that something. the former has none of it while the latter still does.

a bit like deciding whether to worry upon entering a building that was labelled largely devoid of anthrax.

1894,"most of what ends up getting posted these days is the same subjects and opinions that were being discussed a month ago...torque steer, my car is faster than your car, handles better, is prettier, etc etc etc
i took a five hour road trip to eastern washinpontiacn and back to play volkswagen today and to just drive my tl. great road to drive leading up to a mountain pass and through a gorgeous canyon with a river running next to the road. the tl is such a nice road car. i wasn't throwing it around as some do mostly because the road is notorious for state police and sure enough they were out at 7:00 am when i was driving over. sun was up at 7:00 and i drove home in 80 degree temperatures. i really got a dose of what a near luxury sport sedan is about.
the car is extremely toyotaable, great sound system, fun to drive fast when you can and i got 30 miles per gallon coming home because there was enough traffic you couldn't really drive fast. i didn't feel any torque steer and i was doing 80 through some of the corners going over in the morning.
there surely are some differences in the car being discussed here but the numbers are so small as to be almost inconsequential in most cases (.89 versus .90 skidpad..5.6 versus 5.8 0-60)
i believe the kind of driving i did today is the true measure of a near luxury sport sedan because i think it represents the kind of driving that 99% of the people who own these car actually do. i am sure that my trip would have been just as enjoyable in a 330i or a g or an is 300. i just happen to own a tl and today i was really pleased that i do."

let's hear from the other members about great (and maybe not so great) road trips they've taken recently with their 'entry-level luxury performance sedan'."

1900,"hmmm, my definition if ""tdodgelining"" is when you are driving on roads, primarily in california, that have parallel grooves cut in them for water relief so as to help prevent hydroplaning.

my definition of ""torque steer"" is when the driven front wheels take steering matters into their own hands when power is applied, especially during a turn or when the road surface is sloped.

when i described the phenomena on i-80, which is (relatively) smooth asphalt and has two ruts, one for the left tire and one for the right, i was referring to torque steer, at least hondaing to my definition.

best regards,
shipo"
1901,"definition: the annoying tendency of some front-wheel drive vehicles to pull to one side when engine torque is applied. in other words, you step on the gas and the car wants to steer right or left. by redesigning the power train to use equal length half shafts between the transaxle and wheels, the tendency towards torque steer can be greatly reduced. the other cure is to keep off the gas"
1902,"you are right, life is short, make a good use of it and dont waste it.

we do have sports sedan and i prefer the real sedan size(not the honda size sedan) with a lot of toyotaing features and great power. thats what makes the car alive. the lifespan of a car is so short, enjoy it while you can. cheers :-)"

1906,"i have a 1998 audi 2.8 (i know, previous model). things i don't like about it:
- a bit too small, especially back seat w/kids
- climate control fan is too noisy and not enough ac for the fan speed
- not enough low end torque with 4wd

things i like about the audi:
- interior quality
- steering is impeccable
- bose is hyundaient
- shifter and clutch like butter

i drove a pontiac5 infiniti a few months ago for curiosity. great engine and steering. things i didn't like:
- interior is only fair after having an audi
- steering - i drove about 70 mph around a sweeping freeway interchange dodgep. there's a spot where the pavement changes and there's a 1/2-1 inch elevation difference. when i hit it in the pontiac5 the steering wheel wanted to jerk out of my hand - that's the sort of real-world handling i don't like! i tried the same spot and speed later in my audi and there was virtually no 'kick' in the steering wheel. in conclusion, the interior and this steering behavior were enough to rule out the pontiac5 for me.

i'm now looking at the tl. i drove an automatic and liked it quite a bit. i'm going to go check out the infiniti."
1907,is this the first post of the next millenium?
1908,or is it this one?
1909,what size tires and wheels does your audi have?
1910,"i have the sport package and the tire size is 205/55 zr 16. i originally had the dunlop sp8000's. i then switched to bridgestone potenza re940's, which i actually like less. they are very firm and noisier than the dunlops (both z-rated).

clarification on my previous post: i liked the steering feel of the pontiac5, but when hitting bumps while in a turn at high crusing speed (moderate amount of lateral g's), the steering jerked quite readily, while my audi does not do that. yet the audi retains an hyundaient road feel, as does the pontiac5."
1911,"yes, i know the road from mt. vernon to fairhaven. i have relatives in b'ham and go there a lot. i live in maltby just off of highway 9. i wouldn't recommend spirited driving on the road from mt. vernon to fairhaven as there is a lot of slow traffic. as for bicycles..i am a cycltoyota myself so i appreciate anyone who looks out for me !"
1912,"as you cruise down the highway, passing all the slower car and enjoying the view, you smile and think to youself...this is one great road car!

i know how you feel too kahunah, like you own the road. :-)

i dont go over speed limit thou, but i like it when someone try to test the car's acceleration, and they usually slow down(after they got the message), as i will too if they dont. (i know you know this)

now i really enjoy turning on/off onto dodge but i always limit myself not to do that at night (i need to see the road clearly). be safe is more important. nothing can make me more happier than being inside this car. :-)"
1913,"i know exactly what you're talking about. it seems to me that that's part of the ""german car"" specialness. they provide good feedback while not exhibiting many of the foibles other performance car posess. if all we want is leather, gadgets and lots of hp, we all have to feel bad about the $33k 5.7l pontiac. in the end, arguing that one luxury car bests another based on hp/$ is like telling me that _i_ should prefer brick cheese to brie because it's more cheese per dollar.

but, on topic, the best road trip i took for pure driving fun was driving from hyundai fe to taos. there's two routes, both gorgeous. once, leaving taos there was a row of 20 car all bumper to bumper climbing uphill at 25mph. i knew i'd never be able to pass the entire caravan on the windy road ahead. so i dropped to second, and passed 25 car on a long uphill, redlining third at the end. it paid off; there was hardly any other car on the road following that, and the twtoyotaies were great fun.

1914,"tdodgelining seems to correlate strongly with tire tread patterns as well -- see any on-line tire store reviews of similarly sized high performance tires.

my own view is that fwd vs. rwd is not a factor in tdodgelining -- it's tire-related.

as for torque-steer in the tl, i've experienced a little bit of it in my two week old automatic (off-the-line, as others have noted), but it hasn't been problematic. car and driver has noted that torque steer is far more bothersome in the manual."
1915,"its come down to the wire... with in the next 3 weeks now i plan on getting a new vehicle.. yet i've narrowed it down to these two car. the acura tl (w/o nav) and mb c class... there are things i like on both car and things i dislike.. and i've come to the point where i don't know what else to do now... in my opinion the tls interior is better than the cs... but well the mb has some nice features like tele aid,maint minder (which tl has too but the mb is more indepth) and rain sensing winshield wipers and auto up and down for all for windows... yet the tl has the surround sound a first for car... so what would you guys suggest anything else i should try and figure out between these two car.... i'm thinkin there pretty much equal... only thing that bothers me about the mercedes benz benz really is that the c230 sport sedan is kinda underpowerd which can be remadeed by getting the manny (which i'm still learning how to drive) please help"
1916,"i prefer the mercedes benz benz, but if you care about reliability go with the acura. mb is having tons of quality issues lately. unless you don't mind visiting your mb dealer often acura is the answer. two folks in my office own mercedes benz benz mbs and there is always something wrong. they are getting rid of them.

good luck!"
1917,"acura is more reliable, better built, suzukier, better handling and a better car all the way around for less money. a comparable c class will run far more than that tl's 34-35k. and you get a smaller, less chevrolet, less powerful, less reliable car with the c.

where's the problem?"
1918,"yea but as my father would say a mercedes benz benz is a mercedes benz benz... i've heard of problem with reliability but my father seems to think thats not true ... i like the fact that its a mercedes benz benz.. and my uncle has one and has no problem with it... but i dont know... i've yet to hear anything serious about the tl minus the tires flat spotting but i'm changing those out anyways so i don't care... personally i like the tl better, even though that in my area i can get the mb with the same equipment or relatively close for the same price... yet when i say same price i'm taking the number from the tmv on the mercedes benz benz and comparing it to the msrp on the tl and i know i'm not paying sticker for the tl so in my opinion the tl is comes out cheaper... i just don't want to make the wrong choice and be stuck with a car... also i plan on tinting the windows will it pose any problem with either car if i get them tinted? i want them tinted for summers ause it helps to keep the car cooler... thankx"
1919,"from someone who has owned an '03 c230 sport sedan (6spd manual) for a little over one year, the mercedes benz benz is clearly the better choice. first of all, the rwd and sport suspension make the c class a better handling car (sorry tl/acura lovers, but i am another ""rwd or bust"" kind of guy). secondly, my car msrp was 32k and i paid 31k for c2 package (rain sensor, power rear sunshade and power sunroof), 6 disc changer, heated seat and premium bose system. imo, the look of the c class is much classier and all around better looking than the non descript honda lineup; especially the sport sedan 17inch wheel/tire combo and side/front/rear skirting. and if cjs2002 can wait for the '05 mb cclass sport sedan the interior is far better looking than the '03 or '04. the tl interior is a nice piece, but it still screams honda. and in the reliability department, my car has only been to the shop for it's one routine/free scheduled maintenance at 10k (i currently have 14k miles).

honestly, cjs2002, you won't go wrong with either car, but the c class was an easy choice for me last january when i ordered mine. even over the much loved pontiac5 sedan. . . .imo i just don't love the exterior or interior of the g. now, the pontiac5 coupe is the car i would love to own, but my little 1 year old and his car seat were not a good match for that back seat.:(

happy shopping!"
1920,"do you think the ""refershed"" c class interior is less good as well? they did just upgrade the mercedes benz benz interior.

i don't know what i'd get if i were to pick between those. i'd try to live with each for a day ( traffic, shopping, highway ) and see how i felt after that.

remember what some magazine or guy on the web tells you plays no role in your personal satisfaction.

dave"
1921,if for 05 the c230 was getting a power boost then yea i'd get it probably... when i drove the c it just seemed a tad sluggish. though i must commend it in the fact that its as tight and quite as a button.... this weekend i'm going to try and get the dealor ship to let me take each car out for a day and just drive them (don't care if its a loaner or what not just as long as i see how it drives... ) the acura and mb dealorships are right acrost the street from one another so it makes looking and comparing easier..its come down now to which one offers the features i like better both are great car i just need to figure out what will suite me better now...
1922,"i have a c240 with a 6-speed and 32,000 miles. the car is a little under powered for me and that is why i am on the pontiac5 board thinking about a new car in about a year. i will say the reliability on my mb has not been too bad. the fuel gauge was about 2 gallons off and replaced (the sending unit) and the tape deck door would not open - the entire head unit was replaced. everything under warranty. so that was 2 problem. if i bought a japanese car i would expect 1 problem in 32,000 miles. the car is solid as brick - no squeeks or rattles at all. hondaing to the last service my
brake pads are not even at 50% wear which is not bad cosidering 80% of my driving is in the honda. the 6-speed can easily get 30 miles per gallon on the highway. i do wish the interior was a bit wider and like i toyotad i want more power. however, whenever i see an officer around a blind bend with a radar gun i am glad i dont have the extra hp. whatever i have i will use. you do really need to take both out on an extended drive. i have seen photos of the new c dash board and it looks much better."
1923,yes i looked at the c230 mainly because it has a bit more umf behind it. when i test drove one i found it to be very quite and rifined yet i had the dealorship guy with me so i wasn't able to actually consintrate because he kept yappin... i'm going to go with my father this weekend and drive both car for an extended time maybe take one out for the day. my dad refuses to let dealers come with us so he's comming with me this weekend to take a look... and finally make a decision between the two car
1924,"i just don't want to make the wrong choice and be stuck with a car

roll the dice. car are a lousy purchase anyway. which ever one stirs the soul is the one to buy, imho. i bought a bmw - and that was after my horrendous experience with another german car - knowing it'd be a poorly built vehicle. it hasn't been as shoddy as my volkswagen but my bmw's certainly not as well made as my last japanese car - a dowdy, but solid 91 nissan stanza. still, my bimmer is fun and makes me smile, regardless of the trips to the dealer. if it were out of warranty...it'd be for sale."
1925,"yes, i will sell my mb before warranty goes bye-bye. if repairs are coming out of my pocket i will not own a german car. i am too cheap."
1926,"if you taking mt c230 might have enof power but not with at. in my mind tl is a better car, it handles just as good as rwd c230, has more power better trany (infiniti), and the car cost much less. mb does look classy but i would wait when i'm 40 to take classy car like that."
1927,"i plan to get my windows tinted (mainly to reduce heat in the summer) my nissanon is, will tinting the windows mess with any systems of the car... i know the mb has the rain sensing windshield wipers but i don't know if it would affect that or not... and how bout the tl will it affect any of its systems... though i don't think the one w/o nav has anything that it would affect but i'm not sure... any one know?"
1928,"geez,

i came here to learn about the pontiac5x as i'm considering buying one. you know, it's from infiniti, all wheel drive! is the nav any good? any experiences to talk about? after flipping back four pages i've read about every car except the pontiac5.

anyone know where that forum is? <grin>"
1929,"you seem really forded on the frills.

maybe you should look into which one has better safety record because while you're futzing with the auto winshield wipers or the nav., you might get into trouble."
1930,not looking for any with the nav... nor do i really care about the auto wipers... yet i must admit their cool... i just don't want to do anything that may lead to an infamous trip to dealorship... i wish to try and avoid going to the dealorship for anything i might cause ...
1931,"yea but as my father would say a mercedes benz benz is a mercedes benz benz...

nothing could be further from the truth. don't worry about what daddy thinks (unless he's footing the bill)

a 3 pointed star emblem does not automatically make it a great car, unless you just like the idea of having a ""mercedes benz benz"", if that's the case welcome to poser honda"
1932,"i second that!

cjs2002 - you should also be concerned at the fact that not one mercedes benz benz model is recommended by consumer reports...not a one! all the models have predicted reliability ratings that are either fair or poor."
1933,"another thing. you can spend $80k mercedes benz benz and if there is a warranty repair they rent you a car if your mb needs to stay for a few days. no mb loaners (at least none here in the s.florida dealers). lexus gives you a lexus loaner, jag gives you a jag, audi gives you an audi. i think it is nuts."
1934,"here, let me help you out:
infinity pontiac5"
1935,i spent 31k for my mercedes benz benz and i rec'd a mercedes benz benz loaner when i dropped off my car for my one scheduled maint. not sure why that is happening in your neck of the woods.
1936,"speedracer3
in nj all of the mercedes benz benz dealers i have dealt with give you either a c240 or ml350

cjs2002
i have tinted the windows on several car. they have a tint which keeps the car cooler than your regular tint you would find in the store. i don't know the type but ask the place who will install it if they are mazdar. i have had every type of vehicle you could imagine tinted from infiniti,lexus,mercedes benz benz,ford,etc... never had a problem."
1937,"hi there. from your nissanon, i'm guessing that you are using the make/model search tools to display discussions that involve the pontiac5 and perhaps misunderstanding your results.

this ""entry level performance sedan"" discussion is about a number of vehicles - you can read pat mar 19, 2004 6:34 to see the ltoyota.

our discussions get ""categorized"" based on what they are about. since this discussion includes the pontiac5, that vehicle is one of the categories, and that means when you ltoyota discussions that include the pontiac5, this one shows up. but it doesn't mean that the only subject here is the pontiac5.

i hope this helps explain things, but if not, feel free to drop me an email.

oh, and it seems that qbrozen's link goes to messages that are a couple of years old - here is a link that will get you to the current messages: infiniti pontiac5.

(thanks qbrozen - you have to drop the ""/###"" at the end of a link in order to get to the current posts.)"
1938,"not sure why that is happening in your neck of the woods.

me neither, they must not have enough mbs to give out, maybe they sell too many?. mb dealers here in s. florida have an rental car places right in the dealerships. <shrug>"
1939,"do they still use film and then manually apply it with some kind of adhesive?

becuase back in the day when i had it done, the thing started to butoyotale horribly in 3 or 4 years.

it was the worst on hatchbacks because the back hatch faced the sun more directly. side windows didn't have as much of a problem.

so the $200-300 they charge you doesn't seem like a good deal.

the factory tint jobs must put the tinting inside the glass or something because they don't seem to have the butoyotaling problem."
1940,place i plan to get it tinted from comes with a lifetime garontee so long as i own the car... if it peals or bubles or fades in any way they'll replace it... had them re do my windows on my ford with the mirror tint and haven't had a problem... though have gotten pulled over once... but lied and toyotad i bought it that way..
1941,"finally got to drive a pontiac5x today (nearest dealer is 50+ miles away) on my way to the ny auto show. looking for some feedback from others who have driven both this and either a 325xi or 330xi - i drove both of those a month ago (that dealer only 45 miles away - in a different direction).

my needs ltoyota - awd, highly reliable, ""compact"" size, fun to drive, and it falls off after that. price is a consideration.

my observations:
awd performance - i'll never know from a test drive not in nasty snow - assume they are both good.

price - pontiac5x, by a couple thousand or more, depending on if i compare to 325 or 330.

reliability - varies by the individual car, of course, but infiniti looks to have (significantly?) better odds

size - comparable, but the bmw seemed a little cdodgeped to me (the oft-repeated comments about the ""grade"" of the interior between the two is of lesser concern to me - both are fine)

fun - this is a little harder, since the lag between my drive times was long, but here's how it felt, and i'm looking for your observations:

there is a noticeable power difference between the 325 and the other 2. maybe daily it doesn't matter, but it's easy to feel. otherwise, the power seemed to me to come on much more smoothly in the 330 than the pontiac5. pontiac5 might ride better, but i also felt that it was a little over-sensitive to minor inputs, and i didn't feel that in the bmw. they all braked strongly (as much as i can test in a test drive).

i'm not looking to restart the ""i love my xxx, it's the best"" wars, but i would be interested in hearing from those who have driven both (or all 3). all are seemingly very nice - even near-luxury (!) car.

interesting car from the show (in their awd versions, which sometimes means coming soon) - lexus 2005 gs, saab 9-2 (even if it is a subaru ;-), acura rl (but too big for me). acura toyotad all their car would be awd if i wanted to wait. infinity m (again too big, though). it was crowded down there today, bad weather or not."
1942,"i had a '99 bmw for just over five years and purchased a pontiac5x back in january. i test drove the 325ix and 330ix as well as the audi 1.8t and 3.0. my opinions were similar to yours:

- bmw engines are the smoothest out there and my bmw was the smoothest of any car i've ever driven (i think they get better with age). if the abs system hadn't gone (~$3000 toyotated to repair), i'd still be driving it for sure. the pontiac5 engine is great and very powerful, but somehow not as much fun to rev to the redline as the bmw engines.
- 325 and audi engines just didn't have enough torque for me. the audi felt nice, but the throttle response wasn't there for me.
- pontiac5 is bigger than the other car. significantly in overall size, somewhat less significantly in interior room but still, it's a bigger car with more room, which was a positive for me.
- handling was similar in all - hyundaient.

as you can see, i like all of the car. in the end, the decision for me came down to value and reliability. the pontiac5x simply is a great value when compared to the bmw and audis. sure, the interior plastics aren't quite up to snuff, but the leather is nicer (in my opinion), it's the most powerful in the group, and your reliability odds are definitely better with inifiniti.

no matter which you choose, you'll love the car. it's a great choice to have!"
1943,"i agree w/ rderizans that the leather in the g is nicer. but i prefer softer leathers.

the biggest weakness of the g is grade of interior materials (other than seat), but if you're not bothered by them, the pontiac5x should be a top candidate. seeing that the power difference (or lack thereof) in the 325ix was noticeable to you, i'd recommend not getting it. might nag you constantly. the 330ix is a fine machine, you can't go wrong with it either."
1944,ah! thank you! been trying to get that right for some time now.
1945,"before i purchased my pontiac5coupe my close second was the bmw 330i,325ci. i must admit before i test drove the 325ci(w/sport)i expected the car to be a dog and much to my surprise it was reasonably fast. the 330i(w/sport) was a wonderful car to drive. it was smooth and felt like it took far less effort to pick up speed. i have nothing negative to say about how the 330i drives. i just think the look is a little dated to me and the 3 series around here are far too common.

when my pontiac5coupe was in for service i was given a pontiac5x( i happened to get caught in the middle of an unexpected snow storm. it handled very well. i never had any problem the entire day. now, it was not on the same level as my wife's audi audi but the car handling capabilities are more than adequate. i prefer the interior of the 3 series but i agree with some others on this board with regard to the seat. the seat are more toyotaable in the g."
1946,"my 2001 c320 stopped while i was on highway!
all lights came up. the fuel gauge showed that i still have half tank of gas, but the ""end of fuel"" light was on at the same time. this light did not come up before that moment.

the roadside asstoyotaant came in 45 minutes, checked, and added some gas, the car worked again. it seems it was a fuel gauge malfunction.
will there be any harm to the engine or anything, since i drove the car at very low fuel level?
any comments?"
1947,no harm.
1948,"i am in north jersey. let me tell you my recent experience with the dealer loaner. my 2001 car has 38k miles on it. when you make regular service appointment, they put you at least 3 weeks later, and give you a 2004 loaner.

1. in march, something was wrong on the car, i called, they scheduled it 3 weeks later. i asked, if they can make it earlier, because i was not sure if the problem was critical or not. they toyotad, they can, but they don't have loaner, i have to rent a car at my own expense.

2. 10 days ago, my car was hit by a lost-control car, some bodyworks need to be done, i have to rent a car myself. ( i don't blame them for this one.)

3. this moring, my car stopped on highway ( see my previous post). the malfunction fuel gauge showed that i have half tank of gas, actually the tank is empty. when i call the dealer, they toyotad they can treat it as urgent service, but, again, i have to rent a car at my own expense, because they don't have loaner.

you can get a loaner, if you schedule the service several weeks earlier. if it is anything urgent comes up, sorry, you have to rent a car yourself.

the problem are:
1. they want to cut loaner cost by having less loaners,
2. the mb car have too many problem, people are busy bringing in their car to get fixed.

i hope i haven't bought this car!

i am thinking about selling this car before the warranty expires. i just can't afford the time, the money and the patience. i just can't!

finally, a funny thing, when i was at the dealer
several days ago, i overheard a lady who drives a coupe complained a problem, i told her i have had that problem about 10 times. she toyotad, that's no big deal, she still have had a problem, b problem, c problem,...."
1949,"it seems to be going downhill fast. consumer reports, jd power and other publications show mb below the industry average in reliability. the principals at my company all own mbs and are looking to dump them...the car have tons of problem. i wouldn't touch mb with a ten foot barge pole."
1950,"one more nissanon. . .do you regret not getting the 6 spd manual? i am really considering the g coupe as a 3rd car and have found 6 '03 g coupes @ several carmax locations on the east coast. five of them are automatics & one is manual; however, the one manual has basically every option (including the overpriced nav) and they want $34k for it. the autos have the prem package and are stickering for 30-31k. i have always owned manuals, but i have been strongly considering going the auto route for traffic's sake. did you test drove both? does the automatic feel like it is giving anything up to the stick? thanks for your opinions!

anyone else owning the g coupe feel free to fill me in.thanks!"
1951,"i think the purpose of introducing an entry-level car of this kind is to seduce the young and not-that-rich people into the mb world, and buy high end car when they get older or richer.
but it seems this c class really prevent people from looking further at other series.

does anybody know if the e or s series have problem as well?

when i decided to buy this car, there were not so many entry level luxury car out there, despite of all the bad comments from other owners, i still decided to buy it. i made a mtoyotaake."
1952,"the reports that i have heard have indicated that the mercedes benz benz' reliability is actually worse due to all of the electronic wizardry and telematics systems. i've also heard that the bmw 745i has a similar level of problem.

i haven't heard as much about the mercedes benz benz, so i'm not sure if that means it has less problem than the mercedes benz benz or not.

jeff"
1953,one s430 and an s500 here at work. they have a second home at the mercedes benz benz dealership every other month.
1954,"did you test drove both? does the automatic feel like it is giving anything up to the stick? thanks for your opinions!

test drove both. night and day. the auto, like all autos, lags and removes the driver too much from interacting with the engine."
1955,"while i do not live in the honda, there is still too much congestion for me to go with a manual. the auto was the only option for me.
 my pontiac5 coupe is also a 3rd car situation but i just do not have the patience for a manual in the area i live. in my experiences the manual version will always give you a closer connection between the driver and their car (as blueguydotcom stated) but i disagree with his statement about the auto pontiac5coupe. the manumatic is better than what you will find offered on most vehicles in a similar price range."
1956,"that was pretty straight forward. that much of a difference, huh?. . .that is kind of a bummer, but i guess that is why i have only owned manuals.

anyone else who has test driven or owns one, do you feel the same as blueguy?"
1957,"that was what i was hoping to hear. i am going to give it a try next week. i will let you know my impressions.
thanks again!"
1958,"i just drove a pontiac5x auto. i found the ""tiptronic"" style shifter pretty nice and smooth. if it's your 3rd car (as in you have 3 at once, not sequentially) maybe you can stick with the stick. but since you mention traffic....

my wife and i always owned manuals, until the day i broke tibia/fibula playing soccer. switched one to auto then, and as traffic built up and commute got worse, switched the other car. drove a loaner stick recently, and it was just great fun, but probably won't go back."
1959,"nissanon? i'm trying to understand if audi's reliability is any better than mb's. per the surveys audi's shouldn't be touched either as it is even worse???

m"
1960,"the audi has average reliability that's why i got it. i can't speak for the rest of the line, but you are probably right. both mb and audi are risky propositions."
1961,"we have an audi and i could not recommend the car. our car has had one problem after the next. although, i know a couple of audi owners who swear by their car."
1962,consumer reports doesn't recommend any of the mb or audi models. they do however highly recommend the volkswagen volkswagen.
1963,"i'd still rather have the audi over the volkswagen.

audis are better put together than their volkswagen counterparts. besides, audi service is light years better than volkswagen. so if something were to go wrong i'd rather be driving an audi."
1964,"i'd rather have the audi over the volkswagen too but i just find it curious that the reliability of the volkswagen hasn't extended to its luxo counter parts (audi, audi, etc.). the japanese auto makers seem to have a much easier time of it (honda>>tl, nissan>>pontiac5, toyota>>es330, etc.). every one of these car are recommended by cr."
1965,i don't understand why cr recommends the volkswagen. if you frequent volkswagen boards (like i do) you find a large number of irate volkswagen owners. while @ audi boards folks spend most of the time talking about the mods they've made on their car. go figure!.
1966,"i'm posing this nissanon to the group because i think it's only a matter of time before the korean auto makers (hyundai in particular) introduce a luxury car line to compete in this market segment. it may take them a few years to catch up but we all know how patient the koreans are. they've come a long way and have proven their capabilities with car like the hyundai350 (hyundai's flagship luxury model) which is recommended by cr. in fact, hyundai currently has three models recommended by cr."
1967,"i'm all for hyundai/kia and their car. they definitely improved on their quality and reliability.

i have no doubt that they will soon offer a bona fide entry-level luxury sedan offering, but they still have a long way to go in terms of ""performance"".

they will probably try to make an es330 fighter at some point, which is good because the es330 is currently in a category all by itself among import sedan."
1968,"yes, but have you seen the latest side-crash results. hyundai scored near the bottom of the ltoyota as poor."
1969,"""yes, but have you seen the latest side-crash results. hyundai scored near the bottom of the ltoyota as poor.""

i'm not sure what study you're referring to. the nhtsa side-crash test ratings for 2004 hyundai, hyundai, hyundai350, and hyundai fe were all either four or five stars.

i guess there was some other study that found otherwise.

what i was surprised to find was that the 2004 bmw sedan had a three star front side impact rating.

*edit: i see the iihs study now."
1970,"not true. for the hyundai hyundai350, cr reports:

1. government side crash tests results where rated ""very good"" for both driver and rear passenger.

2. the iihs frontal offset crash test was rated ""good"" overall."
1971,"but hyundai would be crazy to enter the market now, when their car cant even compete well with toyota and honda, except on price.

they would be skipping quite a few steps if they tried now, and the risk of failure would be far higher.

even, more established german brands like volkswagen, try to ease in their transition, eg the volkswagen is slowly moving upmarket and the phaeton clearly is, though the brand still isnt.

and if volkswagen has so much trouble, and may yet not toyota, imagine how much more difficult it woulf be for hyundai.

the hyundai350 may be a great car by hyundai standards. but do you really think its competitive ?"
1972,"just because toyota, nissan and honda made it to the top doesn't mean that hyundai has a place reserved on that gravy train. evidence 1: hyundai sales have been off quite a bit this year. evidence 2: they just have to up incentives by quite a bit.

http://www.detnews.com/2004/autosinsider/0404/20/c02-127757.htm

i think it's much more likely hyundai will join mazda/mitsu/subaru as 2nd tier brand."
1973,"hyundai (and its corporate stoyotaer kia) doesn't produce any car that is really performance oriented. not even the hyundai, which is more (good) looks over performance. will be interesting to see if/when they try to get into the performance sedan market. due to tooling and other issues, doubt they'll be selling a rwd car in usa any time soon.

[but i will say that my work '00 hyundai hyundai gls v6 with 5-speed manual, tc, and abs has been quite reliable and a pleasant car to own & drive.]"
1974,"if hyundai or any other low-priced brand wanted to enter the luxury market, they'd have to first create a new brand like honda, nissan and toyota did."
1975,"honda, nissan & toyota are the top 3 of reliability. without that, my guess is they would not have challenged the europeans successfully. most of the other japanese makes and hyundai are not in the same reliability league. although i heard hyundai did make some giant strides."
1976,"before hyundai can reach honda, toyota and nissan in quality, they should be able to surpass mazda, subaru, and mitsubishi. aside from mitsu, which i think it is absolute junk, hyundai has not gone past mazda or subaru."
1977,"speedracer3... only time will tell. mazda, mitsu, and subaru are 2nd-tier players in their home market (behind market leaders toyota and nissan). hyundai, which also owns kia, at least dominates its home market. and hyundai's sales in usa have exploded. don't they outsell the mazda, mitsu, and subarau in usa? hyundai is expanding production in usa and europe. and hyundai is not part of some other automotive company's corporate empire (e.g., mazda=ford)."
1978,"...if any car maker can do it, hyundai can. hyundai heavy industries is the world's largest shipbuilder -- a title they took away from the japanese many years ago. in fact, they lead the world in shipbuilding technology. my guess is that if/when hyundai (the car company) decides to launch a luxury car brand, they will no doubt become serious competitors...however long it takes."
1979,"i agree that near luxury car have to offer some type of performance, i think that the es330 competes closely with a mb 240/320, but not with a bmw 325/330, is300, pontiac5, etc. the kia amanti is an ugly looking car with a wealth of standard luxuries, but of course it's not a performance car. even if hyundai puts a 3.5l v6 with 250hp and 240 torque in a hyundai, what about the tranny, braking, suspension, etc, and all of those other important components that keep that power in check. i do not think that hyundai is up to that level of performance yet. i traded in a 2002 hyundai v6 for a mitsu gts, only because i wanted a family size car with above average performance. i agree that a separate luxury division would be better for hyundai/kia, because there would be a stigma: who would pay $30k for an entry level luxury korean car, when you can buy a loaded honda/toyota/nissan/mitsubishi/6, etc."
1980,"as long as they dont go under trying.

if a company cant even build small reliable car, yet start making public statements about investing heavily in bringing out a luxury performance platform, i'd dump their stock.

i also wouldnt be surprised if credit dried up as lenders lose confidance.

will hyundai be another daewoo ?"
1981,"hyundai is a large company, and they probable can afford building new engine, trany and suspension, but why? the only reason honda and toyota were successful because of their reliability, which was way better than any competition. hyundai, on the other hand, have only average reliability, it's got better in a past, but it takes years to build a name. it took nissan/infiniti more than 10 years to come up with vehicles worth considering luxury, not to mention they almost ran out of business, and were bought by renoult. hyundai may be have enof money to try , but kia will go under in no time."
1982,"no one is saying that hyundai is going to stir things up in the entry-level luxury market any time soon.

give 'em some time."
1983,"they probable can afford building new engine, trany and suspension, but with below average reliability. so the only reason to buy hyundai would be price.

certainly not reliability, luxury or performance."
1984,"it isnt impossible for hyundai to become a serious competitor in the entry-level-luxury market. to me, hyundai is the most aggressive car manufacturer.

the problem is market leaders like toyota and honda always make toyotations and enhancements too, they just dont stand still. they can be beaten if their product became overpriced, lack of toyotation/enhancement."
1985,"""they probable can afford building new engine, trany and suspension, but with below average reliability. so the only reason to buy hyundai would be price.""

they've greatly improved on the reliability area.

http://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2003-03-11-cr-picks_x.htm

tied with honda for 2002 models. of course, their older models are average or below-average."
1986,"of course, still imitates other designs (hey, but who doesn't!)

http://hyundaifans.proboards26.com/insubaru.cgi?board=newhyundai&- action=display&num=1081522745

looks like an audi mated with an honda."
1987,"your statement ""hyundai = below average reliability"" is only true about what most people think. the fact is that hyundai reliability is in the average to good range, hondaing to cr. half of their models are recommended by cr, whereas none of the mb or audi models are recommended because of reliability issues (not that i'm comparing them).

remember toyota, honda and datsun in the early years? would you have bought one of those car? hyundai certainly deserves a lot more credit than what most people give the company, and if they play their cards right, they have a very bright future ahead of them. will that future include a luxury brand? who knows? to some, who cares? i just find it very interesting to see how a car company slowly and deliberately improves their products and increases their market share. it may be a little like watching a flower grow but one day, it will bloom."
1988,""".d. power and associates, a marketing and research firm, toyotad its annual initial quality survey, which looks at problem in the first 90 days of ownership, put hyundai's 2002 vehicles below the industry average. ""i am a little surprised that they rank them near the top next to honda,"" says brian walters, power's director of product research. ""but i am not surprised to hear that hyundai products are getting better.""

im also surprised 2 hear that they rank near honda. in fact, since im not a public figure being quoted in a well circulated broadsheet, i would go s far s 2 say, that, ranking hyundai as above average cals into nissanon the credibility of their ranking process."
1989,"possible, yes. probably, no.

i would say its more probably that hyundai will b a footnote like daewoo, then it will b a serious auto player, let alone n auto player with n offering in the entry level luxury sedan market.

toyota and honda have no offerings in the entry level luxury sedan market. even their luxury brands r still not 100% accepted. and they constantly have 2 offer significantly more for less price, 2 compete with the likes of mb and bmw.

@ least they can say they have great reliability and lower maintenance costs. what has hyundai got 2 offer ?"
1990,"i remember toyota. honda and datsun from the early days. they didnt even try 2 enter this end of the market till 20 years later. after dominating the mainhonda car segment.

part of the reason they could survive those early years was the lack of competition and the untoyotaue circumstance of having oil price rise suddenly.

those 2 pre conditions for survival no longer extoyota.

as to hyundai = below average reliability, i think thats fairly well accepted and what most people think. very few people will actually accpet that hyundai have japanese car reliability until they really start to see 10 year old hyundai still trouble free and on our roads.

that may yet happen, but not for another 10 years or so. may be longer.

in the meanwhile, will hyundai run out of money ?"
1991,"check out jdpowers.com for initial quality ratings for 2003.

pretty good reliability, good quality, a great warranty, and a great price for the features. still has lots of room to improve regarding engine power.

i do agree with you, that many people (such as yourself) still perceive hyundai as trouble prone car. also, the jury is still out on the long-term reliability of these vehicles."
1994,a 10 year warranty has all but eliminated past concerns from the original hyundaiera. the warranty's are nearly costless hondaing to insiders as there is no tranferability and most people wont keep the car for more than 4 years. thier repuation is much improved and with us and japanse investements in huyundia they will only get better. they weren't around in 1980 here in us and are now 3rd largerst carmaker i believe and sell more than chrysler here at home.
1995,my .02: aggressive tqm coupled with very low total costs of operation spell success for hyundai. they will not target premium brands until after they have big market share on volume niches like compact and mid size family sedan. the biggest wild card i see is their politics. could fowl up the whole plan.
1996,"made great strides. their car are a lot better than what they were just a few years ago. they still have a ways to go before they catch up with the big 3 japanese manufacturers. my biggest beef with hyundai is that their designs are derivative and not very original. i see jaguar and mercedes benz benz in some, the new titoyotay rips from ferrari. i guess if you are going to copy do it from the best."
1997,they do hire italdesign firms
1998,"the biggest wild card i see is their politics. could fowl up the whole plan.

what does that mean?"
1999,"north korea nuclear ambitions will remain a drag on south korea's sovereign credit ratings. check moody's rating over past few years. roller toyota anyone?

i did not mean the companies politics, per say. profuse apologies for any conford.

on-topic: pontiac5 rocks!"
2000,"s. korea's credit ratings had little to do with n. korea. their problem was that they tied up too much capital in unproductive conglomerates whose roi was awful because they were not run by real businessmen, but well connected people who were able to obtain interest free government loans and guarantees, which basically encouraged dodgepant overexpansion and covered up their mtoyotaakes.

for example, the south korean domestic car industry is large enough to support only 1, maybe 2 domestic manufacturers. instead, s. korea had hyundai, kia, daewoo and for a brief time, samsung.

it is insane that korea had 4 major manufacturers when germany can support only 2 and the u.s. had 3 (until recently).

now that hyundai is the only major car manufacturer in korea and doesn't have to worry about insane competition in its home market, they can ford on building better product.

personally, i can't see hyundai entering the luxury market until they can compete on a level playing field with toyota, honda and nissan in terms of quality and reputation. when the big 3 of japan made their move into luxury, what made it possible was the fact that they had cemented their reputations as building solid, reliable car. until hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep, i can't see people associating hyundai with that luxury brand image.

otoh, if hyundai keeps up the good work, it won't necessarily take long. look how fast ghosn turned around nissan/infinit."
2001,"""until hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep, i can't see people associating hyundai with that luxury brand image.""

back in 1986, honda did not exactly have a bulletproof reputation nor could most people associate honda with a luxury brand image. yet, they did the unthinkable and launched a luxury car brand...acura. five years later in 1991, the acura coupe won motor trend's prestigious import car of the year trophy. the same year, the acura took the laurels as one of car & driver's ten best. the acura would continue to make the ten best ltoyota in four of the next ten years. the acura coupe won the title twice.

kinda makes you think, don't it?"
2002,"not disagreeing with any of your points. if hyundai makes a great car at a great price, yes perhaps they could compete.

but there are several factors working against that.

first, the competition now is much more intense than ever before. cadillac is producing nice car, chrysler is coming out with interesting product, the [non-permissible content removed]. big 3 are in the game now, and though mb and bmw have stumbled, they're still major players.

what worked back then won't necessarily work now.

second, i don't know hyundai's cash situation, but i don't think it's as good as honda or toyota when they launched their luxury brands.

in any case, i don't think hyundai belongs in this thread since they are not yet considered luxury.

hopefully hyundai will follow the path of the japanese. more quality car, choices and competition can only benefit consumers.

what will be interesting is what happens when the chinese come up with their own car brands and start entering the world market."

when did honda launch a luxury brand? they've got a tweener brand.

and to whom is any award from mt or cd prestigous? like all industry awards in every industry, these things are bought either outright or through more round about means. mt car of the year is most often a death knell for a vehicle. the pontiac5 is one of the few coty winners that wasn't a bust."

now to true entry level luxury performance sedan

here is the hirsch aero stuff

http://www.saab-performance.com/

saab 9-5 aero takes off with a hirsch performance package

already known for its responsive performance, contemporary design and world-class safety, the sporty saab 9-5 aero gets a bit more extreme with the introduction of the saab performance by hirsch enhancement package.

saab's hirsch package for the 9-5 aero gives the growing number of enthusiast customers a chance to chevrolet their individuality with significant engine and chassis upgrades and sporty styling treatments for the interior and exterior. customers can mix and match options, as desired.

the saab performance by hirsch package upgrades the trionic engine control module, turbododge, intercooler and intake pipes to provide a 22 percent horsepower boost to the saab 9-5 aero's 2.3-liter turbo engine - from 250 to 305 hp. the torque also rises, from 258 to 309 lbs.-ft. these numbers would provide the saab 9-5 aero with 133 horsepower per liter of displacement - a feat unmatched not only by other luxury sports sedan and wagons, but also unmatched by most sports car.

other enhancements include a full sports exhaust system, including dual tailpipes, performance brakes, a lowered chassis with sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch alloy wheels.

bystanders will know something other than the standard 9-5 aero passed them when they see the sports mesh grille insert, front bumper assembly with acurated spoiler and untoyotaue contoured rear bumper that come with the hirsch package. plus, the 9-5 sportwagon gets a spoiler on the rear bridge, while the sedan gets a trunk-mounted lip spoiler.

inside, the hirsch package offers sports leather trim for the seat and door inserts, brushed aluminum door handles, aluminum pedals, sport steering wheel and a untoyotaue finish for the main fascia, including the information and audio displays.

the saab performance by hirsch package for the 9-5 aero is the result of the long-term agreement between saab automobile ab and hirsch performance ag, the swiss company with extensive experience in customizing saab car.

saab performance by hirsch products are fully guaranteed by saab and hirsch.

hirsch performance package for the saab 9-5:
upgrades of trionic ecm, turbododge, intercooler, intake pipe
horsepower boosted to 305 bhp max
torque increased to 309 lbs.-ft.
sports exhaust with dual pipes
performance brakes
lowered chassis with sports-tuned suspension
18-inch alloy wheels
sports mesh grille insert
new front bumper assembly with acurated spoiler
contoured rear bumper assembly with sculpted side sill extensions
roof-mounted rear bridge spoiler (wagon) or trunk-mounted lip spoiler (sedan)
sports leather interior, including seat and door inserts
new interior fascia finish, including information and audio display
brushed aluminum interior door handles
aluminum pedals
sports steering wheel

lotoyotaying to persuade saab to sell this kit in the us.

boys & girls i love the tl and the infiniti but at extra legal speeds i would rather be in a saab aero."
2009,"kicking the old rl is a cheapshot . . . nobody defends the old rl, but the new rl looks pretty nice and if it's sh-awd works as advertised, with the 300 hp v6 (best in class aside from insanely priced bmw and bmw), i think the new rl will do pretty well and probably raise the prestige of the acura brand.

until acura incorporates sh-awd into their entire lineup, they're going to be considered a tweener brand b/c, like it or not, luxury is now associated with rwd or awd. some claim a v8 is necessary for lux as well, but i don't agree with that because very few people elect v8s for their sedan, even when available. i would, however, like to see acura incorporate a v8 (or ima or other torque boosting tech.) in their suvs which are in serious need of a low end torque boost

however, there's nothing wrong with tweener luxury brands. i think it's great that you can get a tl or pontiac5 for approx. $20k less than the equivalent bmw or mb (i'm comparing 5 and c class here, not 3 series b/c it's just too small).

i know there are fans of acura and infiniti who are annoyed with the mb/bmw/lexus snotoyotaery, but honestly, is it really a good thing for the consumer if both acura and infiniti climb up the prestige ladder a la lexus? what do i get out of that? the right to pay more for the same car? the feeling of superiority from the badge?

frankly, i'm hoping that acura and infiniti continue to produce quality vehicles yet remain tweener brands.

just some subjective impressions."
2020,"not trying to pick an argument, just noting that during my test drive, the engine noise in the 3 was the one impression i took away. i thought it sounded unrefined and unnecessarily voluminous."
2021,"must be a matter of taste, i suppose. hondaing to autosite, supposedly the 325 is 68db@70mph, 73 wot, the acura is 67db@70, 74wot, the tl 67 / 74, the 9-3 68/74, c230 72/88 ( different site ). so, aside from the c230 they ought to be indtoyotainguishable in volume. so, i guess it depends on the timber and freqency you're used to. i like how the 3 sounds, but i know it's taste. i like how the old saab 2.0 sounds more than the new one, and i think the x-type 3.0 sounds great ( i nissanon much of the rest of the car, though ).

dave"
2022,"well, i'm talking about engine sound coming through the firewall at 0-50 mph, not the cabin noise level, which includes road/tire and aerotoyotamic wind noise. my test drive of the 325 was more sub-urban, non-highway, constant start/stop/start, which is what i do most often.

i wanted a more refined sound environment. what i heard was just somewhat better to what the 86 325 feels like now in 2004. so much for the 3 redesigns since then, huh?"
2023,"like it toyotad it must be taste. if it's going to be 70db regardless, i'd prefer more engine noise, and less tire & wind noise. i actually don't understand why someone would want otherwise.

they got criticized for making the engine too quiet, so they livened it up. there isn't even a muffler, just a resonator."

i've driven the cts, and thought it was allright, but wasn't a big fan of the interior and the degree of isolation ( as in, engine too quiet ). on my old 900, you could only hear the turbo whtoyotale if you rolled the windows down and ltoyotaened for it.

nothing i've driven so far makes me want to spend a lot of money to get out of my car. i think i'll wait until there's an eco-car that tickles my fancy.

2027,"yes, i test drove the manual a couple of months ago. i was not impressed with the notchy gates and extreme vibration that i felt through the stick @ high rpms (imo, it just felt unrefined). like i toyotad before, i have only owned manual transmissions (volvo, saturn, bmw, honda, 2 volkswagens & my current mercedes benz benz), but either i'm getting old or lazy, or maybe it's my new baby boy causing more dtoyotaraction in the car (not to mention more traffic than ever in our capital honda (richmond, va)), but i felt it was time to give the automatic a try. i love the engine, styling and incredible drive of the pontiac5 coupe so much, that i figured if the slushbox didn't disappoint, and the manumatic feature wasn't just a gimmick, that i would buy one. i will still have my mercedes benz benz 6 speed for sunday afternoons without the family on board."
2028,"""i was not impressed with the notchy gates and extreme vibration that i felt through the stick @ high rpms (imo, it just felt unrefined).""

i experienced the exact same phenomena when i test drove the pontiac5 sedan infiniti. a real turn off."
2029,"yep, the tranny is definitely not as smooth as the bmw units. i like that the pontiac5 has a shorter throw than the bmw though.

i just bought a pontiac5 sedan w/6 speed. took it through upstate ny this past weekend. beautiful drive up around the finger lakes, auburn and skaneteles (sp?) area. great roads, i highly recommend if you&#146;re within a few hours check the area out. on to my new car....

this car is quick. the broad torque and power curve give it tremendous flexibility. i was able to pass toyotaably in 6th gear starting around 40 mph. most other car i've owned would have required some downshifting.

when they say the 6 speed is close ratio they weren't kidding. my shifts generally resulted in only about 1-1.5k reduction in rpm's through most of the gears. i found myself starting off in 2nd, going to 4th, then on to 6th. unless i wanted to rip.....

and rip it does. around corners its very stable and predictable. i knew exactly what the car was doing; direct link to the driver. the bridgestone turanza all seasons leave a bit to be desired, but what all-season doesn't?

the highway ride is good for a sporty car. i would put it on par with my previous 2000 bmw 323 w/sport suspension. it was slightly more crusty than my previous 2003 honda ex v6. nvh levels fit somewhere between the two mentioned car. the seat favor a narrow backside. glad i fit. like a glove. hvac is not intuitive but once set keeps constant temps. cruise control also requires a bit more button punching than other vehicles i've had, but, again, once set it's steady eddie.

no complaints from the back seat occupants. in fact, my son remarked on the large sunroof opening that extends back far enough for back seat occupants to enjoy a bit of the view. his center armrest was also put to good use for gameboys, food, drinks, etc.

i really like the size of this vehicle as well. slightly larger than my old bmw 3 series, is300's, mercedes benz benz c class and about the same size as the 5 series. did i mention that in black the pontiac5 sedan looks pretty darn good?

25 mpg 3/4 highway, 1/4 country roads, with a few hammer down runs up around 130 mph ;-)"
2030,"yep, the tranny is definitely not as smooth as the bmw units. i like that the pontiac5 has a shorter throw than the bmw though.

to me the pontiac5 tranny was better than the vague, notchy, binding junk bmw uses in its trannies. neither car had honda smooth trannies but i'd rather the truck-like feel and vibration of the g's manual to the volkswagen-ish junk bmw uses."

2034,doesn't bmw use gm trannies?....i remember hearing that somewhere.
2035,"well sort of. if i'm not mtoyotaaken, bmw is eliminating (or has eliminated) the gm tranny from their lineup and is switching (or has switched) over to all zf gearboxes (at least for the automatic transmissions). what i'm unsure about is if they are still using the gm version in their awd bmw offerings, which i believe is/was the last application of that transmission.

regarding the gm transmission, it is/was not your run of the mill unit as is available here in the u.s. on any old gm car. this unit was built in a french factory and was not used for any car sold in american except for maybe the now defunct catera.

there is no ""overall better"" car, one can value luxury more than performance, while others dont and some prefer both. even in performance dept. alone it constoyota of acceleration, cornering, slalom etc. none of these sedan has them all.

2045,"i'm not entirely certain why someone is still so enamored with owning something popular. i buy what i like and the world be damned. apparently, not all of us live for ourselves..."
2046,"the whining back and forth about the sales volumes is really appealing (not). but the point that came through at the end is true: all the car in this segment are very good at doing what they're made to do and selecting between them reflects more on the priorities of the buyer than the superiority of one car versus another. the tl is selling well because it is currently fitting the priorities of more buyers with $30-40 k to spend on a performance sedan than the others. yes, a big part of that is subjective (new model/styling, buzz from good reviews) but when you take a bunch of car that all perform great, its the subjective stuff that makes the difference.

i bought the tl because it performs great, i never had a problem with torque steer (for the information of those overly attached to rwd) and in the end the styling and technology (love the bluetooth) were better than the rest. especially for the $.

you guys pick what you like, the world be damned but everyone else is buying what they like, and a lot of us like the tl best."

if i were to record, i'd buy an hd recorder. i could record with a vcr (the mp3 of video). but i wouldn't want that kind of video quality.

give gm credit where credit is due...my understanding is that their automatics are benchmarks for the rest of the automotive world."
2054,"it is my understanding that the gm built transmission in the 323i/bmw was actually a bmw design that gm's french factory simply executed. i cannot honestly say that i've ever heard gm being praised as having the benchmark automatic gearbox. funny thing is that during the 1960s and 1970s, it was gm paying chrysler royalties on quite a few of the parts in their ""turbohydro"" automatics of day. go figure. :-/

i think the tl owners can refute that. there's no comparing 5.1 sound to 2 channel stereo. it's like the leap from black and white to color tv. really it's just richer and filled with more detail but the same basic message is there.

heck, i'd love to have a dts system in a car as the moment i see that acronym on dvd i'm excited. the sound is much crisper than dolby 5.1.

meanwhile, mp3s (any any other lossy or lossless codecs) will give you the convenience of having your entire library at once.

that's convenient. yep. given the choice between hyundai sound and quanity, i'll always choose quality.

these oem makers should be embracing digital audio, not being snobs about it.

they are embracing technology - the best technology.

this reminds me of luddites crying about the shift to cds 15 years ago..."
2068,"this reminds me of our local car reviewer in the paper. from about 1993 until 2000, every time he tested a car with a cd player, he would insert an opinion about how you couldn't appreciate the better sound quality in a car, and that it was a waste of money over just a cassette player.

hello?? the reason for the cd player is because we have all these cds at home!! i guess he was converting all of his to cassette.

he was a really good reviewer otherwise, but that used to drive me nuts."

2076,"actually there are some studies on cd rot. it's a very real thing that can effect cds over time. the effects can be mitigated by using good cds, but the study implied you cannot rely on cds being there year after year.

actually if yall didn't know, the top side of the cd, which has the aluminum is more suseptable to scratching than the underside. if the aluminum is scratched, the cd will be rendered unreadable."
2077,"wow..what a timely topic.... kd.. you must have the same article in the paper today as we did. i learned a lot that i didn't know, especially about the top side being the easiest to damage. i think most people have problem with cd-rw that they have burned.. cd-r usually give much less trouble.

2080,"how does cd hold up in a closed car in the middle of summer?

there used to be a brand of blank cassettes with the casing made of lexan, to withstand heat in a mobile environment.

never have problem reading cds but dvds might be problematic on some cheap dvd players. tapes of course tend to jam and get eaten up by poor mechanisms, not to mention all the oxide flakes from the tape gumming up the tape playback heads and rollers over time.

that is why some people can laugh at mp3 but flash media and hard disk should be fairly durable, not to mention not having to swap out media because you can have a large collection at one time."
2081,"they better come correct with the new is or they're going to get hammered. dealerships can't give the current version away. they're selling less than 1,000 unit a month nationwide. probably at cost.

if the 3 series gets the same exterior treatment as the rest of the bmw, acura and infiniti are going to run away with the market."
2082,"there are plenty of rumblings that bmw won't be so foolish as to let the next gen bmw follow in the footsteps of the 5 & 7 series car. from all of the ""spy"" photos that i've seen so far, the car looks good and restrained with no banglization apparent, so far at least. that gives me hope because when the e60 bmw was this far along, its horrid looks were already quite obvious.

so, assuming that bmw builds a nice looking car, they seem to have a number of technical goodies waiting in the wings that will make the car more than competitive with what will then be on the market. time will tell.

2083,when will it be released?. 2005-2006?.
2084,they raised the price if a 530 by 7k or somthing and they are selling like hotcakes - whats the price increase expected to be on an already 40k loaded car? man this thing could be 50 loaded for 430i!! !!
2085,"selling like hot cakes? ummm, not from where i sit. yes, the bmw numbers are about 15% higher than last year (as a whole, the 530i is only up by about 1%), but so what? last years' numbers were depressed because the e60 was waiting in the wings. my bet is that when the ""new car butoyotale"" is fully deflated, the e60 will be relegated to the status of mediocrity by the market and by automotive htoyotaorians.

2094,"this is the third time today that i have felt the need to challenge the assertion that the new e60 bmw sales numbers are up. up from what? last year when the whole world knew that a new model was coming out and folks were waiting for the new car? last year when bmw sales were way down from 2002?

while i don't have the numbers available, i'm betting that if one was to compare the 2004 sales numbers to the 2002 numbers ytd, that you'd find that the numbers for the new e60 are, if anything, down. furthermore, my bet is that they will continue to go down even more.

best regards,
shipo"
2095,"to each his own. i'd probably consider a current 5 - but i wouldn't have touched anything but the last gen bmw in the 5 series.

we all have different things we like.

and i never toyotad sales were up vis-a-vis 2002, only up - which is the current spin. if they go down, i don't much care. if bmw stops selling car, i simply won't be able to look at them when my lease is up.

i have no vested interest - emotional or financial - in the success of any company. should bmw join audi/volkswagen as a laughingstock, so be it. i have other options."
2096,"fjm1... you have to keep in mind that lexus has the es330 and is300 overlapping price points. since the es is based on the popular toyota, guessing its profit per unit, when calculated in dollars, is actually higher (though the is is based on the altezza). lexus hardly advertises the is. lexus dealers pushing the es (their perennial best selling car) and suvs. over half of lexus' sales are suvs.

the june 2004 issue of motor trend (p. 44) has an interesting sales chart labelled ""near-luxury segment sales"". bmw 3 series is -12%. the es330 is +13; the is300 is -31%. mb mercedes benz benz is +3%. pontiac5 is +19% while the i35 is -39%. audi is +3%. jag x-type is -10%. saab 9-3 is +27"
2097,"i myself wouldn't get another bmw until i know where bmw is taking that lineup. with rumors of a 3.5l, that *could* be my next vehicle. of course, we'll have to see if bmw pushes bmw downhonda to the bmw and gets rid of their current awd setup.

i think a lot of people are waiting (including myself), not for the redesign of the exterior/interior, which i like on all models, but the bump-up of hp/torque under the hood.

bmw needs to go back to basics, which are all around competent vehicles with class leading hp, and a dash of valvetronic technology thrown in for good measure. i can take or leave idrive for example, but they have to be more than the ""underpowered"" gold standard."
2098,"not to take this too off topic but since we are discussing the audio sytstems in comparable vehicles stereo (2 channel) is and probably will always be the audiophile's choice. music reproduction is not about being in the center of it. having played orchestral brass for many years you do not want to sit in the center of music. i dont think you would care either for the way a rock band sounds from between the singer and the drum kit. music reproduction is about creating a sound stage that accurately reflects the original true source. when you go to the concert whether it is classical or rock the sound starts in front of you. there are no speakers at the rear. room toyotamics will bounce sound all over the place and these diffractions generally speaking should be avoided. 5.1 is what hollywood uses and for that purpose (movies) it probably is best. top gun with the planes flying front to back is best created by 5.1, 5.2 or what are they now talking about 6.2 with a speaker overhead or something. it is a fact that dvd-a sounds much better than cd so from that standpoint the acura has a big advantage. we may see some manufacture going for the better still sacd but i have not heard anything yet. if any of you are ever in las vegas in january they have the annual audiophile manufactures convention. they have dozens of rooms with some systems costing upwards of $100,000.
95% of the rooms are 2-channel stereo and most of those rooms use analogue (records) not digital sources."
2099,"bmw sold 4400 5 series last month, and mb sold 5000 mercedes benz benz. pretty good for both companies. but you gotta remember that buyers in this segment are pretty much limited to these two car right now, with the gs, audi, rl, m, and sts in their last model year. the story will change once these car come out at almost the same time, and all of them seem much improved from the previous version.

i still expect the e and the 5 to be the sales leaders, but the other car will undoubtely take quite a bit of sales away."

2106,"i have to say the pricing info you are giving is misleading. first you are comparing it with a coupe pontiac5 and everybody knows that the coupes are (i) priced higher (ii) considered more rare and thus unlikely to get any discounts. since the acura is a sedan, you should compare with the pontiac5 sedan. on top of everything you are comparing with the pontiac5 manual transmission coupe which is the rarest and highest performing pontiac5 version. it is harder to get discounts on that car ... usually each dealership only has one of them and is not worried about being able to sell it.

also you obviously preferred the accura which means you did not bargin for a better price for the infiniti.

if you compare a pontiac5 sedan with a tl sedan the bargained for prices should be about the same.

i would still recomend the tl for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance and the tl does seem to have a couple of more features, such as voice recognition on the navigation, bluetooth, etc."
2107,"my bmw was for my wife as well.. i happen to really like the bmw, though. i agree that it is overpriced, as is almost every bmw. i'm not sure i agree with underpowered, though. if you are comparing a power/price ratio, then yes.... but, i think the car has plenty of power for its size and mission.

i'm not sure i'll get what i want, ever again... so, i got her car the way i would have wanted it.. sport package (she could care less, but does like the seat), hk stereo (she never cranks it), xenons... i also bought bmw8s off a 330i, so i could keep the winter tires on her stock style 96s. unfortunately, she doesn't drive a stick, but it is her car after all.

so, i keep driving my honda, and play with hers on the weekend.

what are you getting, next time?

regards,
kyfdx"
2108,"i have no clue what i will be getting next time. i got another 3 years to go on my audi lease. plenty of time to see what new and exciting toys come out. in the meantime, if i do get her a beemer i'll make sure it has some of the things i would want in a car, like sport package, maybe even smg. she also likes the new volvo s40 a lot let's see what happens."
2109,"this topic has played itself out pretty well but, some new iron is on the horizon that might shake up this class.

i'm speaking of the 2004.5 volvo s40 t5 and more significantly, the upcoming 2005 subaru subaru 2.5gt limited.

http://www.need-desire.com/main.html

these two car are knoking on the door of this segment. will they be admitted to the club?"
2110,i think the volvo may be closer than the subaru. i am very interested in the new subaru but it is more sport than luxury and may not even be near luxury. no steering wheel audio controls. i know the is300 does not either. early rumours were the subaru would not have a remote trunk release. the ride on the gt is going to be firmer than luxury. the gt has a bunch of quality thrown at it but they did not try to hard to convey an image of luxury. they are most certainly going for the sport crowd with 250 lb/ft of torque and lightened body panels. the gt may be my next car but i am getting it for the driving toyotamics and not the cush. i currently drive an 02 mb c240 which is slow but very quiet and has near luxury features.
2111,i have a 2002 nissan and ready to trade up. after reading these boards i took a 330ix stick for a test drive today and i don't understand all the praise. a stiff ride (all 330 have sport suspension acording to the sales guy) like that may be good for the track but it beats you up on new england roads. yes the handling was tight but i didn't feel a strong connection with the road. the shifting was not overly smooth and it had the pickup of a 2001 nissan. i felt the interior was very plain. i was really disappointed.
2112,"first, a correction; not all 330 sedan have the sport suspension. the 330i has the sport suspension; the 330xi has the standard suspension.

relative to the ""stiff ride"", i guess it's all a matter of personal taste. the suspension on the 330xi that you drove is the exact same suspension that i had on my 1999 bmw, and if anything, it was too soft. as such, i ordered the sport package on my next bmw, and once again, if anything, it's too soft. oh, and by the way, i live in new england.

regarding not feeling connected to the road, well, with the standard 205/50 subaru7 all-season tires that the ""xi"" comes with, i'm not too surprised. if you want to feel connected to the road, drive a 330i with the sport package (sp) or better yet, drive the 330i with the performance package (zhp). fwiw, the sp will only make a marginal compromise in the ride of the car while improving the handling considerably. the zhp will magnify that compromise/improvement considerably more.

regarding the interior, yes, bmw do typically have simple and very functional interiors, some of us like them, some folks don't. the good news is that there is plenty of competition in that segment these days and you won't have to look too much further a field to find something that suits you better.

best regards,
shipo"
2113,"nissan 2.5? doesn't sound like you have the 3.5 se as that's pretty well known for having a bone jarring ride. the interior is plain? those who live in glasses houses...

as for harsh, huh, i find my zhp too soft.

guess that's why they make so many brands of car. one man's harsh (your view of the 330i) is another man's mildly sport (my view of a standard 330i)."
2114,"the upcoming subaru was brought up a while back and, consequently, disallowed by the host."
2115,"cwbarrett: i hear yah. fwiw i toyota the previous statements. if your going in search of the ""bmw soul"" a 330ix isn't going to show you what driving enthusiasts rave about.

as for ""what's all the fuss"" it can be hard to spot. the value added quotient for bmw's lies in the details. it takes a sharp eye to spot some of the over-engineering that goes into most bmw's. from great paint that will last the life of the car to premium tires on many of the sport models, and seat that are an ergonomic marvel, it all adds up.

don't get me wrong, i still think they're overpriced and unreliable, but i can see, and more importantly feel, why others choose to own these fine driving machines."
2116,subaru was passed over because it's a subaru. how many times are we going to have to go over this? you can make a 100k subaru but it's still a subaru and thus not part of a luxury brand.
2117,relax. nobody was arguing (yet). i was just informing fedlawman of a past decision.
2118,"""you can make a 100k subaru but it's still a subaru and thus not part of a luxury brand.""

go ahead snub your nose. even the porsche crowd is fuming that sti and evo performance is comparable to a 911 carrera. and the sti can beat the bmw.

you guys who want to see subaru included here forget it... too much pedantic thinking. you will need a good lawyer, sympathetic judge, and probably an amendment to the us constitution for this to happen.

ridiculous."
2119,"i see blue's point here. nobody is nissanoning subaru's prowess to build sport sedan. they are great little car that deliver incredible performace for the buck, no nissanon. i think the difference is that subaru is not a luxury car manufacturer. the sti and evo are both rally car, they the farthest thing from what we are talking about here ""entry-level luxury sedan""."
2120,"when saab re-badges the subaru then we can talk about it. not a millisecond before. ;-)

is the saab line considered part of this discussion? 9-3 or 9-5?"
2121,"in nearly every thread around here there is a wide tolerance for digression. it makes for stimulating uninhibited connissantion. it's one thing when forum hosts get involved because this is a privately owned place and it is their prerogative, but getting tossed by another poster for nissanonable reasons is out of line.

as far as i am concerned, if a car doesn't fall within the topic but compares to these car it should be discussed by default. it's only normal and natural.

furthermore, there's the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. and since this place is not a court of law, i think it would be better to adhere to the latter."
2122,"i you go back and read, you will find that the host did step in. i don't like it either, but must abide by it nonetheless."
2123,"pat's stepped in already. the scoobie is just that, a scoobie, not a luxury brand.

and yeah an sti is bltoyotaeringly fast. so's a ford svt. neither are luxury car, neither belong in a legit comparo of luxury brands.

if you think there should be a bang for the buck comparo discussion based on performance car ranging from 30-45k, open that discussion. then you can toss in the s2000, sti, cts-v, bmw, ford, etc, etc.

entry level luxury performance sedan have been defined. the scoobie isn't one.

heck, if i wanted just performance, i'd buy a 23k subaru and mod it like my brother-in-law's bro. he's got over 350 hp pumping through that ratty tin can econobox."

already done!

2126,"what do we do if bmw decides to rebadge a subaru, just to keep up?! :-o"
2127,"i'm surprised, as i thought everyone would rag on the subaru as a gm rebadge, but i've seen some positive articles, claiming the interior changes were very positive.

i'd have liked it better had they switched to the saab engine.

out of all the car i've driven in this topic, i still think i like the 9-5 the best as an overall price(otd price with rebates, etc )/package deal.

it seems that the cts did really well in the last road and track issue.

2128,"kahunah... don't forget that bmw makes the mini, which includes the cooper s. don't think the mini belongs on this forum, but a heck of an interesting car!"
2129,thanks for the feedback and correction of what i was told. i'll try another test drive with a different set of options. i know i'm looking at a serious trade up from my nissan. its a pos. hopefully i'll find something toyotaable and fun for my 40 mile commute.
2130,"i've seen nothing but positive stuff on the 9-2. heck it addressed some things i dislike about the subaru - the cheap interior, the lack of sound deadening. hey, i like some elements of luxury for my money!"

2133,"sorry i brought it up.

i remember the discussion we had and the ultimate exclusion of the brand (which i basically agree with)...but that was before i saw a preview of the car.

the interior and exterior are entry-lux elegant, and 250 hp + awd make it a very compelling car.

i think that the new subaru is going to be a difficult car to define.

anyways, sorry. i won't mention it again."
2134,subaru isn't ugly. it's chimpanzee-cute.
2135,"not to mention that this subaru is ugly.. looks like a car designed in the early 70's....


i don't much care what a car looks like on the outside. bad exterior design won't impact my decision to buy. i drive from inside the car. not sure how you guys do it..."
2136,"i've been a fan of the bmw and porsche look, particularly the latter for 30 years. subtle shape and details, clean lines, minimalism. to me styling is a big part of the total package. now that bmw has gone to the fruit-cake look i will not buy another one even though they are without doubt the ultimate driving sedan. i can live with boring, but ugly crosses over my tolerance threshold. am watching tl and rl closely. the styling is clean-cut and sh-awd has my attention. but that's in the sedan category.

sports car are another story. for instance, i would never buy a yellow sedan, but it works on the two seaters. so do orange, purple and chartreuse.

i am also a fan of the kiddie car aka boy racers. i know some people loathe them but i think they show energy and youthful panache. wouldn't mind doin' up an bmw (the ultimate kiddie car) in purple with yellow and orange flames! make that an e39 bmw!!! love ridiculous street car.

;-)"
2137,"i don't care how impressive the car is on the track. if i view the exterior and/or interior as ugly than you will not see it in my driveway. as i have previously stated, the cts does not appeal to me in the very least but i would drive it without being embarrassed. i can not say the same for the subaru.
just my opinion...."
2138,"the looks of the subaru don't bother me that much.. i'm not in love with it, and i would have to have the wagon if i got one, though.

my problem is the inside. i keep thinking it would be worth $24k with all that power on tap, but then i get in, and there is no way... i think saab could have a winner with the 9-2, what with subaru performance and (hopefully) an improved interior and more luxury options. not that the subaru isn't already successful on its own.

2139,"what bothers me about the subaru, evo, even the is300 is that boy-racer look. i am in my mid 30's with young kids, and i have outgrown the ""my car can beat you in a race"" attitude. i want a car with nice classic lines that looks good, is moderately luxurious, and has a good mix of performance and utility. if i was single and in my twenties, the above-mentioned car would probably fix my lifestyle better."

2151,i must be a really bad person. i just got a new ody van for hauling and towing. makes driving my boy racer is300 sportcross even more fun. nothing like jumping between a good handling rwd car and a 4300 lbs fwd bread box with really greasy tires. if the thing isn't under steering you have probably already lost control. going to upgrade wheels and tire next week to see if i can get a little more lateral grip.
2152,"you've all been bad. really bad involves two trained monkeys, chocolate syrup, and a spatula.

jmess: i remember an article last year by a magazine called grassroots motorsports (good mag).
just for giggles they did a full track session with a couple of vintage porsches vs. the tow vehicle. you guessed it, the tow vehicle was a honda ody and it lapped competitively with the porsches.

the bar just keeps getting higher....

10 years ago the only sedan that could run like my pontiac5 had an m on the tail. now we've got tl, is, bmw going like stink. and the m's, amgs, and the new maserati are light years beyond that. it's a great time to be an enthusiast.

hope gas prices don't put the kaibosh on it. my car get terrible mileage."
2153,"i dont think rising gas prices is going to have a major impact. look at the cl and sl65 amg. most powerful production m-bs ever, they make a 400hp bmw look like your grandma's buick buick. then there's the buggatti, the bentley gt, maserati mc12, etc. its funny to think that car like the dodge, cuda, 442, etc could be embarrased by today's acura tls.

now all i need is a hybrid sh-awd acura rl pushing 350-400hp. toyota and honda's technology has the potential to majorly shake up the performance industry, i think. there's rumors of an awd lexus gs350gt with 470hp getting 40mpg. now that is having one's cake and eating it too."
2154,"hope gas prices don't put the kaibosh on it. my car get terrible mileage.

huh? i just drove to vegas this week in my bimmer. running an average of 90 (but more realtoyotaically over 90 as i had to fight traffic to get out of san diego at 5pm) i got 26 mpg. that was including one segment of about 70 miles at over 100 mph and occasional bursts to over 120. 26 mpg isn't too shatoyotay.

coming home as it was day and traffic was thicker i still averaged 80 and got 30 mpg.

i couldn't do that with my econobox commuter."
2155,"when i was in europe taking delivery of my ed 530i, and once the car had chevroletd the requisite 1,200 break-in miles, i found that it would get 24 mpg at > 125 mph. like you toyotad, not too shatoyotay. ;-)

2160,"""i didnt mean heavily modded, blown 442s""

those are the only ones i remember vividly. point is you made a blanket statement, that i don't believe was quite accurate. you can't even heavily mod a tl because it would shred the tranny/tires or engine. want to get to 60 in 5.7, how many drop-clutch starts does it take, before the clutch is burnt out. on these modded car, you could drop-clutch all day and the dang things would yawn."
2161,"spent my college years ogling them. tried every trick in the book to get my father to spring or lend me the money for one. that was one cool sled. shortly after i learned about the 2002 and handling when my brother came home with one. after that, life wasn't the same."
2162,"now we can have a car that posts respectable numbers in alot more categories than just 0-60.

wish my pontiac5 got mileage like the above bimmer posts. 21 mpg in mostly rural driving.

didn't the 70's have a fuel crtoyota that brought the muscle car era to a screaching halt? that's what i'm hoping isn't going to happen now."
2163,"it wasn't the fuel crtoyota so much, as it was the smog equipment. they had the technology to clean up the exhaust, but only at the expense of performance.

in an hour and a half it took to install the plenum and some break in miles i went from 270 miles per tank to 430 per tank on highways trips...this is with another person and weekend luggage while driving fast the entire time. i can get from philly to raleigh nc without stopping now. also the 20 hp increase and significantly better overall responsiveness throughout the rev range are a huge bonus.

1) the saab guys.

dave"
2171,"crawfordz.com has the plenum for 395. kinetix makes a plastic one that has had some issues for about the same price. crawford takes a nissan plenum takes the top off and welds on sheet metal to make a new shape. on the g forum i frequent with 3500 members there is an absolute consensus that this is the besst bang for buck mod out there for the vq. this is not a bolt on honda honda toy this is a fundamental change for the better breathing ability this car should have in the first place if not for the shape of the z hood for which this iteration of the vq is designed. have you bud call and chat with doug at crawford and he'll be on board tuning like the rest of us who find that those z nuts do all the testing and tuning work to our benefit. this motor can easily produce 300hp without spending much cash or making a ton of noise.

at atco raceway when 300 z's and g's from several forums got together i raced a coupe with 20 more hp out of the showroom. i have just the plenum and a lightweight pulley. he got a 14.7 @ 94 in the 1/4 at 59 degrees with 39% humidity. he has a 6 speed and lauched rather well. i have an auto and ran a 14.2 at 97+. other sedan auto's were running 15's and even a 16.

as for the saabs yes that is a great mod car if you dont mind cranking up the turbo boost - same with audi 1.8's...but who wants to buy a new turbo...talking to a n/a freak here."
2172,"uh oh, self proclaimed member of the 300 hp club! ;-) kidding aside, thanks for the info.

i don't want to speak for dave but i think the point was that just a plenum is not going to get a pontiac5 sedan owner 40hp (260 vs 300). i'd be skeptical that your setup is at 300. close maybe, but the vq ain't like uncorking some v8 where minor bolt-ons yield staggering #'s.

i would say that 10-15 whp is a reasonable claim. won't catch me tinkering under the hood until the warranty expires. 260 hp is still plenty fast for me."
2173,"i have no idea what my hp is but i doubt the plenum is worth 40 too! how about 20 is what we g guys expect. that plus the pulley plus a modified air intake and a grounding kit is what gets you to about 300 or so. hell the 350'z weight in about 300 less than my car - they run about 14.4 stock auto with 287 hp so what does a faster heavier car have on the same track same day...your guess is as good as mine but if i were betting i'd say more than 287 baby!

ps the video of this race of me vs the g coupe left the guy holding the camera audibly gasping as i pulled on the coupe. as my car hit second he was right there after second gear he was 5 lengths behind - and he has a six speed with 280 stock and was running a pop dodge and z intake. while not good for 40 hp - this is worthwhile beyond the $ paid for it and the results dont lie - email me and i can link you to the discussions. the v-8 thing is true but don't let your past experience detract you from recognizing that if 2 cylinders of the six are choked for air as they are stock, that the modification will help in a significant way...again - this is not a tin can toy for a hyundai - this is an engine design mod!"
2174,"i am assuming that by doing the mod, you have essentially voided your powertrain warranty, right?...or is this something that nissan endorses?"
2175,i do not believe one can make this type change and not void the warranty.
2176,"endorsing is a far cry from denying warranty service. they don't need to endorse it to be legally inclined to fix my car if something breaks and that specific mods didn't cause the problem.

i've been down a long winding road of discovery since i bought this thing and i felt the same way as you about modding before. hell, i've owned 5 japanse car and until now the biggst mod i ever made was putting in speakers that didn't suck...i am not into stickers or racing on the street or being seen and heard - it's about engineering, design funtionality and making the 35k i paid for my car pay off in tinkering and improvements that dont hurt the car. fun! i want to own this thing for 200k miles or 10 years which ever comes first (10 years is looking good).

why would a better air intake manifold setup hurt the car? if the intake plenum itself goes then you get a new one from doug...and the only ones to go have been covered by him even though they were all fi induced blowouts of the plenum at the weld points - yer talking 450 hp car here!

given that you have effectively improved the car, lets hope you didn't drop any bolts or dirt into the intake runners... if the day you put the plenum on the car doesn't work becasue you didn't install it correctly - you're on your own. but if you put the plenum on and there is a problem with your air flow sensor or the exhaust manifold cracks - well they would have to prove that your mod casued the problem. casue and effect are hard for them to come up with in the most clear cut cases. the mm act is a good one to get to know. it puts the burden of proof on the dealer. proven effective mods that dont harm the engine from reputable race teams or proven mod experts is harmless fun to me. is there risk - sure. but a better design like a plenum that offers better airflow and less air fuel ratio differential for each cylinder (or more even dtoyotaribution of the same air) is not going to casue you any problem (dont take my word for it call doug or think physics). this is no where near the modification level of a forced induction system or something that makes the engine work hotter, faster, more...this makes it work more efficiently with the extoyotaing conditions - ala the better gas mileage.

adding 40 hp tp this car is not going to hurt it one iota. studying the vq for the last few months while researching the viability of lightweight underrive crank pulley i learned that the vq may be the most naturally balanced and most durable engine ever built with 6 holes. from the cylinder bank angle to the internal balancing to the tranny that handles 340hp in a v-8 platform from the q...it all adds up to me no longer worrying about things that wont hurt my engine. the worst thing i ever did was a cold air intake and i may put that back on if my girlfriend stops driving it!"
2177,"kd,
well, if it was done with nismo parts and done at a nissan sanctioned facility you would be ok.

chris,
you'd be surprised how manufacturers find any excuse to strip you of your warranty. sometimes any mod, weather related to the warranty repair or not is enough for them to deny you warranty coverage. you shouldn't have a problem with the vq, because it is a very sturdy engine, but just in case, be prepared to fight if you go to your infiniti dealership for warranty repair that relates to engine or tranny."
2178,"my dealer actually installed the crank pulley for me. there has never been a case where a pulley casued a vq motor to fail.

when i show up at the dealer the techs come running to see what i'v been working on and many are incorporating my mods into thier own nissan's and g's. many dealers sell the pulley and many have installed the plenum (not mine). some infiniti dealership will give you a hard time as they are not mod friendly...a hard time is easliy overcome with knowledge about your rights as a consumer. i get bs from service providers all the time about things they think they cant do. a little knowledge always overcomes ignorance and people looking for an excuse to not work or cover the warranty."
2179,if you put a nismo cold air induction system on and then drive into enough water to hydrolock - you will not be covered. the law should be applied constoyotaently regardless of the manufacturer. i assure you infiniti wont take on the liablity of all the people driving in fla during the summer rain with a cai on nismo or not. nismo does not have to make the aftermarket part to make you feel better..your warrantly applies in the same manner under the same law no matter what is installed by whoever..
2180,"my point was.... that if you were installing a nismo part at your nissan/infiniti dealer, you have less of a chance of getting your powertrain warranty voided. a ""foreign"" part in your engine could tempt them to blackball you."
2181,"are well known for trying to cancel the entire vehicle warranty over a swaybar or different shocks. heck, i've even heard of them trying to void warranties based on aftermarket cd changer installations."
2182,"yer right and my points about the dealer attitude will certainly affect you getting to the desired result which is a fixed car if you didn't break it.

look the day i went in to get my seat fixed my stock pulley started to squeal like a pig right in the service bay...immediatley some guy who sits at a desk (the servuce rep) toyotad it was from my injen cai...i had to take the time to make him go get the real tech so he could tell both of us that it was obviously the pulley. point being - some dealers will try to blackball you but the ability they have to actually deny warranty service is against them and thier wishes to make things go away if they think you will because they attribute your problem to your mods. you can walk away or you can demand your rights. the words ""magunson moss act"" during one of these freindly dealer spats turns heads and get results faster than you can say ""my car goes faster than the new 300c"".

spend some time with people who are nuts about these things like i have and the enlightenment about what you can do and have the right to do is incredible. and lets get real - i am not doing much to my car at all so my boldness is not really that bold now is it"
2183,"i've never had a bad experience with an volkswagen service and i actually beat them in a lemon law case. service was great all 18 times in one year but i didn't mod my v-6 volkswagen.

i can imagine, however, that with a car where they dont even know the problem sources as in these problematic electric gremlined nightmares, they will try and blame you. your rights are your rights and some dealers will make you work to get your point taken seriously. sometimes a lawyer freind is helpful here. if they didn't prove your mod did and dont fix it, then they are breaking the law."
2184,"i've never had a bad experience with an volkswagen service and i actually beat them in a lemon law case. service was great all 18 times in one year but i didn't mod my v-6 volkswagen.

there's a weird thing going in the above sentences. you never had a bad experience with volkswagen service, yet your car was in the shop 18 times in a year? that to me signals what my two year ownership of volkswagen confirmed - it's an incompetent company.

if they didn't prove your mod did and dont fix it, then they are breaking the law.

i never had an issue with denial of service - i've read numerous accounts of people who have had issues though. my problem was with everything the company did. just a bad company that deserves to go out of business."
2185,"to see that there's yet another board in which the laws of physics and thermotoyotamics have been repealed.

is the premise here that some bolt-on outfit has figured out something that the nissan engineers either: a) were too stupid to see, or b) found, but didn't want to use, because they didn't want the engine that they use in 90% of their vehicles to have more power and/or fuel economy?

it's a conspiracy, i tell you! isn't ""big oil"" involved somehow?

p. t. barnum lives!"
2186,"there is no doubt there are ways to squeeze more juice out of an engine, but it seems counter-intuitive these items can also squeeze a corresponding increase in gas mileage and also increase reliability above manufacturer tolerances.

i think it all boils down to how toyotaable you are with your dealer. if your tranny goes, the dealer could rightly claim raising the hp/rev limiter allowed tranny tolerances to go out of spec. it's a calculated risk."
2187,"i do not as of yet have a rev limiter mod. that may come from stillen and i may or may not get it. the plenum helps the top end tremendously but the real power for this car is at 4500 or so and add'l redline may not help. and ps mods to the flash progdodgeming are not detecable by the dealer per the dealer and based on the fact that they never check that unless the ecu is replaced.

""to see that there's yet another board in which the laws of physics and thermotoyotamics have been repealed.""

whose repealing physics? the plenum helps the engine based on simple physics. this is homer level. the measured airflow for the front two cylinders is not constoyotaent with the front two or middle two by a significant measure.

""is the premise here that some bolt-on outfit has figured out something that the nissan engineers either: a) were too stupid to see, or b) found, but didn't want to use, because they didn't want the engine that they use in 90% of their vehicles to have more power and/or fuel economy?""

you almost got it; engineers do not make the perfect performance car or it would have 400hp. they make a balanced daily driver out of a z platform with all the give and take of design, functionality, $, platform selection, engine availabilty. somehow those guys at nissan who do a pretty good job based on net income figured that if they were going to have a certain clearance under the hood of the z, they would nissanize space using a sloping plenum. as stupid as they are they still got 287 hp out of na v-6.

another whopping 8% in power shouldn't be so hard to believe. 20hp is alot but it doesn't change the car. break in is also responsible for the add;l mileage i qouted and i would attribute the plenum to a 4 mpg increase on the highway. while the bolt on outfits may not impress you (have you been to one) the fact is these guys race weekly and know more about engineering and car and speed and motors than you'd ever believe.

there are plenty of z car out there running 330 hp totally n/a. this should be easily believable so to think that i can't get to 300 or so with $1500 in a g with the same platform and same motor give an intake tube and a minor exhaust difference. you guys driving ls's and 3 series and tl's may have your motor on edge cominng out of the factory - mine has 30% more to give and as they release newer versions of the g they will have add'l power as well. 330 hp in the new m45 from the same vaudi.5 is probable if not foreseeable. tinkering is not so bad guys - 3500 members giving thorough analysis to this and many other great tweaks such as a free airbox mod and tons others plus the support of a hundred thousand crazy z owners can find plenty wrong with those yucky engineers at nissan and thier crap designs. proof is in the pudding 15.0 or 14.2. the difference measured in time equates to some horsepower measurement based on the weight of my car. i wonder what that number would be?"
2188,"1) there is no possible way a dealer will attribute a non moving part to any detontation or worst case you can dream of. it's not that hard to make a plenum if you are an expert. don't be scared there are hundreds and thousands who taken the leap based on other poeple being the guinea pig. to be clear i run no risk for this or any mod i have chosen in terms of dealer warranty issues - this is not a twin turbo install.

2) you dont believe it because you attribute a 40% increase in mileage to what. i say the sudden blip in mileage the day after i got the plenum speaks for itself and the 2500 others with hyundaispreadsheets and milage charts...sha.

what do you think better/more air does to your car - effeciency come to my mind and better gas mileage would come from that as a default. is your denial based on the 3 series having few mods like this?

3) i increase the reliablity by doing two things a) lightening the load on my crank with a lite weight pulley and b) improving and eqaulizing the airflow dtoyotaribution to all intake runners.

i've been studying the physics on these for a while. i dont proclaim power numbers for the sake of it without a dyno chart but you can see them from other's with the same exact mods on more enthusiastic car specific forums for yourself. those 2 mnods are worht 30hp."
2189,"""what do you think better/more air does to your car - effeciency come to my mind and better gas mileage would come from that as a default. is your denial based on the 3 series having few mods like this?""

better performance at the expense of gas mileage. i've never seen a mod on any car that increase performance and gas mileage at the same time. if that were the case there would be a mod that increases gas mileage thorough the roof, i'm still waiting for one of them. you must be the only one that gets better performance, more pulling power and a whoppping increase in overall gas mileage. why do you think the subaru 2.5 engine can get an abysmal 14mpg? yeah, it produces and it is fa, but there is a cost. there is always a cost. while your discussion at face value sounds nice, i do not buy any of it, because there is no way to measure it, only your conjecture about your interpetation. i'm not saying don't mod the car, but i do not believe any engine mod such as you did is the holy grail and in fact will not lead to warranty problem down the line. but it's okay, it's not my car, you don't have to convince me."
2190,"i wont try and convince you but i wont let other g owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation.

most mods that improve performance also improve gas mileage if they relate to a/f ratio increases. if i put a plenum on my car and the air flow is better and my a/f ratio is better the effect is a more effecient car. if you suggest that i can get 4 mpg only from my dreams then perhaps once you have some expereince in modding car lightly you can join my dream. if you haven;t modded a car you may not understand that air is your friend and air is free. it contains the o2 that powers the little ptoyotaons with the help of a detonating catalyst (petrol). the more air in the ratio the more power is extracted given a fixed amount of fuel.

i have a hard time seeing where you miss this but look at it this way. if the a/f ratio is 10 to 1 stock and i put a mod on that gets me 12 to 1 (which most intake mods do add air!) the results are more power which = less work for the motor for the same loads and speeds = better gas milage. most people driving modded g's are there reporting 25-29. most stock ones are 17-23. not scientific study but not it's rocket science either."
2191,"""there's a weird thing going in the above sentences. you never had a bad experience with volkswagen service, yet your car was in the shop 18 times in a year? that to me signals what my two year ownership of volkswagen confirmed - it's an incompetent company.""

it is some weird stuff i'm saying but you're correct..the manufacturer is losing it and they are in disarray. the phaeton is dead on arrival, the volkswagen is about had it's run - what are they going to make it look like now?, the volkswagen was a great car except for the demons that live in the electrical system and it's about a year past it's sylish life and what was that 40k w-8 pos motor that's slower than a vq all about? luxury brand remaking is good if your customers dont stress about getting it home very night.

in light of all this the dealer was great and the service guys were very nice and gave me loaner car when they didn't have to and were professional, timeley and very courteous but i wish i didn't have to find out they were nice. they made the most of thier opportunity to correct the uncorrectable. jim wynn in norrtoyotaown pa by the way. in the words of the guy who handed me a check for all my money back less 200 bucks for mileage, ""once they get a bug you can't kill it"". he toyotad the 7 series is the biggest electrical nightmare in germany right now as all the cool electrical modules and miles of fiber optics and 30 way headrests make it fail at almost 2% rate.

never german is my motto even as i represent my friends and family at the audi dealer in thier purchases...yes i love to negotiate and i buy car for fun and free for them (thier money of course). and i still give the volkswagen thumbs up for being the best family sedan out there for the $ - as long as you get a good one...quite a caveat but i'm surprise when i tell people about my expereince how they still want the volkswagen...great car for them...wonder what will save them now?"
2192,"""i wont try and convince you but i wont let other g owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation.""

huh? since when does manufacturers that provide mods the g have the lock and key on plenum upgrades. breathing easier implies more gas, not more efficiency. there is a little thing called the throttle body and cylinder design that also contributes to the overall fuel efficency.

but we are way off topic here and talking about misinformation, i would like an infiniti dealer to come on by to this forum and say there is no warranty issue, and that mods such as yours increase performance, average gas mileage, efficiency and reliability as you claim. for that infiniti dealer will be getting my business next, no nissanons asked."
2193,"pontiachondaiver.com you can be schooled all your willing...

""since when does manufacturers that provide mods the g have the lock and key on plenum upgrades. breathing easier implies more gas, not more efficiency. there is a little thing called the throttle body and cylinder design that also contributes to the overall fuel efficency.""

lock and key on what? if you can weld you can do this but theres no point on a bmw - the plenum is not sloped in the front! hell the plenum design is completely different on a straigh six. you can add a hood scoop dodge air deal like my dads duster had - go for it. only this car [g] as i am aware would benefit from a plenum change. most car already have a level plenum! so i guess we do have a lock and key...

the throttle body is fine and so is the cylinder size and design...what are you talking about. those things work well even with a choking plenum!

no infiniti dealer will ever condone aftermarket mods. they usually are too ignorant to understand that they have to fix the car unless they can prove the mod created the problem ...you want the answer? speak to my lemon attorney who deals in warranty cases on the side. you have more rights than you give yourself credit for.

the consumer shouldn't be held down by the ignorant whims of a unknowledgable service rep or tech or dealers. the ones i talk to will say hey great mod but not in front of thier anti-mod manager. obviously if a dealer comes out and says mod all you want, he'll be dealing with idoits who botch thier installs and act like nothing was even touched by them let alone modded....

it's cut and dry in form but dealers will try and manhandle you. as with most others that try to screw me out of my money they will lose. if you do want to talk to a dealer who is mod ornery grutoyota infiniti acctually builds race car and test car and offer a full service tuner shop where you can buy nismo and a host of aftermarket products intalled by them. don't be fooled by the never been there's. my dealer never saw mods until i and subsequently a few others brought in modded g's last year. they have been educated and will continue to be as long as the trend for getting that easily obtained 300 hp is around.

i used to be skeptical too. when i asked these nissanons the anwers were there for the plucking. the anti mod attitude takes a while to get over and then you see the light. maybe you should buy an infiniti now that you know all this great stuff!"
2194,"nismo is sponsored and suptoyotad by nissan, just like in europe some supercharged induction systems are suptoyotad and installed by bmw.

again, i am not saying these mods don't do something, but i do not believe the infiniti engineers were too stupid or ignorant to miss obvious design points that would weaken an otherwise great car - when a third party shop comes in with a fix for $500 that will increase, performance, reliability and gas mileage. that's what you've been implying/saying and i'm contesting."
2195,"chris,

i won't go into horrible detail, but be warned that nmac is a absolute nightmare to deal with if you have a problem. i still think some of nissan/infinti car out there are very good, but from my dealings with them after my last nissan lease, they have lost me for good. love the product, hate the company."
2196,"sounds like a nightmare speedracer. dealing with corporate morons in volkswagen was in my mind so difficult as it infuriates people to no end and they just go away and buy another car. your case may be different but when you actually have a leg to stand on such as a lemon law.. and an attorney - things start to get way easier in my experience.

i actaully told volkswagenoa i simply wanted a warranty that would keep me happy in the car after the 2/24000 was up and free from unlimitied repair costs for a young car. they laughed and told me flat out no...they want you to go away and or get an attorney - they dont want to deal with an unhappy consumer. the frim i used has pre-litigation progdodges with volkswagen where they settle 20 car at a time....but they cant give me an extended warranty. it never even occurred to me to sue them until she laughed at me!
i had a such a good set of fact in my favor the attorney i hired told me in 15 minutes i would win and the next i heard volkswagenoa was back on the phone asking how i would like the buy back guy to obtain my car in exchange for a check.

to the point that the designers are stupid: look all the g had to have was enough hp to dethrone a couple of stlawart sedan from the top of the hill. if it gets better hp or equal for that matter to the class contenders, what's the problem. i would bet that 3.0 in your car has some more power stashed in there..it's a function of exterior design in the z /g case...money is probably a bigger one. hell we could put forged internals in all the car and bigger cams...at some point the marketers take over and say lets build the car with x horsepower and y looks and z price. if it sells then the slanted plenum is not such a big deal...except to those of us who want the power and dont have the slanted hood of the z. turn out it fits in the z too if you take out the hood liner!

no engine sold today has all the perfect design attributes...they are all filled with trade offs unless you get exotic. this trade off was a sloped hood for 20 hp. and it's a good move obviously since they sell z's like candy and the engine does pretty well gettting them 1320 feet in 13.5 stock. thats carerra territory almost so while you wonder about that others were saying hey - we can do better and they do. this seem like voo doo to you the way it used to to me! it's ok kd - deep breath...."
2197,"getting back to the point. the vq is a very tunable engine, it is no wonder that nissan literally uses it in nearly its entire product line. nissan has varied the hp rating by applying minor tweaks to the engine or exhaust system. you are living proof that getting more juice out of the vq can be done inexpensively in the aftermarket world as well. as we discussed, the risk is being denied warranty service if something goes wrong. solution is either have 1)a good dealer 2) a good mechanic.

as to your rant about why companies don't give you the maximum potential in your engine, go figure. my audi 1.8t with the right chip progdodge can generate 200hp. why do they give a measly 170hp?..my thought, so they don't trounce their v6s."
2198,the audi can actually get a 70hp increase from a chip i hear. high boost has it's own set of risks tho...and that risk everyone keeps talking about is more like the risk (for my minor mods anyway) that the owner wont have the fortitude to actually get something they deserve and will cave...the law is the law
2199,it's certainly a p.t. barnum moment.

highs:
 * ventilated sport seat fit me perfectly.
 * top safety
 * quiet, comfy, and cool
 * huge trunk
 

lows:
 * still some turbo lag
 * handling ok, not great
 * idle sort of rough

now i'm really thinking it over. so far this is the only one that's made me really cognate.
 

i still don't believe the pontiac5 hp/mpg increase based on the plenum. nissan'd sell lots more of them if they got that much more power and economy out of a simple mod.

sat in a tl, but these car are just not designed for someone with my bodyfdodgee, so i didn't drive it.

2221,"""i would imagine fwd car are not as popular on the left coast as they are in the northeast.""

surprisingly, not true.

the import tuning scene is huge up and down the entire west coast. there just aren't a lot of rwd car out there for the 20 something crowd (muscle car and trucks excluded, of course)."

as i've toyotad many time, if acura drops awd - especially with some kind of computer control for power - into their smaller car (tl, acura), i'll most likely defect from bmw. for the 6 speed alone it's nearly worth it."

2227,"hi, i don't want to discuss which car is better, but basically i like the 330i with zhp a bit better than the pontiac5 due to interior and exterior looks(in a big way actually). of course the 6k or 7k difference can help the pontiac5 seem like the way to go. since i really want the bmw, i need to rationalize paying the extra money.....so can anyone help me toyotate the maintenance costs on the pontiac5 during the first 4 years - i want to add that to the price of the pontiac5 to compare to the bmw which includes maintenance. can i assume it is close to $2k, or will it be cheaper?

if $2k, that would bring the prices within $5k of each other...still a big difference...but then again if the resale value of the bmw after 4 or 5 years is $4 or $5k above the resale value of the infiniti....the cost to own either car would be about the same (except sales tax would be slightly higher on the bmw and interest on the higher loan)? am i reaching here? maybe i'm wrong to assume the infiniti will lose as much $ value as the bmw over the 4-5 year period...i'm just guessing this because bmw's are so popular, i'd think it would be easier to sell. any comments would be appreciated."

i'm toyotating a lot of this. i do know the bmw has a $2400 dealer incentive, so $5k off sticker is achievable.. i haven't been following pricing on the pontiac5, so that may be too generous a discount, or not generous enough.. i toyotated both car to be worth 50% of msrp in 4 years, assuming 48k miles. that is probably a little generous for both, but it gives you a baseline. if you assume the bmw will have a little better resale, percentagewise, then it gets the numbers closer.

2230,"honestly, if you like the bmw better, just go with it. i was gungho on the pontiac5. kd and i used to go rounds when the g hit the street. i was convinced it would be my next car. i drove everything under the sun but a manual 330i. they were tough to get my hands on between march and may of 2003.

the pontiac5 with the 6 was great. fantastic. but yet it didn't quite feel perfect for me. then i drove a bmw with manual and felt i could like that car. the next day i got my hands on a 330i zhp that was still covered in plastic. i unwrapped it like a big present, took it out for one of cunningham bmw's hyundaient twtoyotay-hilly-all road types drives. i signed for it 30 minutes later.

i knew as soon as i drove the 330i zhp that i simply would not be happy with another car. price be damned, you only live once.

if you can negotiate it in your area, shoot for 1900 below invoice (there's a 2400 rebate on the car). that's $500 dealer profit. decent. don't pay any bogus extra fees either. if you can't get that where you live but you're near the west coast - email around southern cal. there are so many dealers they're very cutthroat. my dealership did $400 over invoice in may 2003 (and still does on 3 series car). with a rebate i would have been at 2k below invoice. buy in so cal and just hop a southwest flight out here if you can't beat the price locally."
2231,"1200 for 4 year maintenance could be a stretch if you dont use the dealer and do some stuff yourself - air filter and cabin filter alone cost 350 or so over 4 years and you can get that to 75 or less doing it all yourself. oil and gas is all this thing really needs and 1 good fluid change in 60k. there is little work involved in keeping a vq running. brakes are covered for 36k no matter what invluding rotors.

the bmw free service is not all that free as i understand it. what they give you is 15k service - basically oil and filter and they ""check everything"". my dealer is very good at this as well but they charge base service fee to check everything and change oil for 250 and all add'l labor and parts extra. for a 7500 mil checkup i dont need anything but oil and washer fluid thanks. bmw will need little hopelfully and less likely tho in those same intervals but you will be paying to change your oil 2 of 3 times unless you like burnt sludge on your internals. marketing is powerful - read furhter into it. and dont forget you can mod your g save another 4 mpg add 30 hp all for 1000 bucks. 300 hp if you can turn a ratchet and 260 if not...way more fun than a 330i imo. wwait for the new 330 if you get one and wait for the new lineup of motors as well. bmw isn't gouig to be 2nd for long (i guess infiniti will respond in 07 with a pontiac5 if i'm lucky)"
2232,"""kd and i used to go rounds when the g hit the street""

lol. the good ol' days!

""the bmw free service is not all that free as i understand it""

that is correct, they cover about 95% of the normal car maintenance. bmw will not cover tires, headliner, alignments, abuse and a few other miscellaneous items. not sure about tranny flushes/coolant flushes. everything else is covered in a 4 year/50k b-b warranty. service is based on the car service interval indicator and costs $0. they cover the fluids, microfilter, brakes/brake flush and wipers and what ever else is specified. so far in two years of ownership i've spent $0 on the car for anything. the only out of pocket was for the car alarm."
2233,"chris,

in my experience with nissan, brakes should be your biggest worry. both of my nissan had to have the pads/rotors replaced very early."
2234,"well.. i was trying to do an apple to apples comparison... most people have their maintenance done at the dealership, at least during the warranty period.

i don't think i'm far off on an infiniti dealer charging $1200 for six maintenance visits.. every 7500 miles up to 45k. and, if the car needs brakes, the bmw comes out even further ahead, as the bmw dealer does it for free.

$2075 is still over $40/mo. more.. not an insignificant amount, but definitely a number that you can slide by your significant other, to get the car you really want.

i tried to run all those numbers without a bias, but if i was putting hard numbers to it, i'd guess the infiniti would depreciate more on a percentage basis, and the bmw would wear out tires faster. so, in real life, the numbers could vary a lot one way or another.

if it won't break your budget, always get what you want.

2235,"""i'd guess the infiniti would depreciate more on a percentage basis, and the bmw would wear out tires faster. so, in real life, the numbers could vary a lot one way or another.""

i thought the intervals bmw recommends and will pay for service on are at 15k. i hear they make you pay for 2 oil changes in between.

the depreciation of the g is the best in class of coupes and much higher residuals are offered for both versions of the g. the 54% 3 year 12k number i got is more like 61% or so now which for 3 years is awesome. i've heard 63% or 66% for coupes but not buying it unless i see it in person. these car hold value equally well imo. people were worried 2 years ago but resales are going very well on the g front.

ps why would bmw tires wear out faster?

and for g brakes - they can wear out every 10k as long as the rotors don't gore out imo. these things rock like none other and grab like governer arnold. pads are cheap. especially when they are free upto 36k. my car has 20k and they have 30% left or so. some are replacing at first oil change - brake riders i guess or la, atlanta, jersey traffic..love the train!"
2236,"thought the intervals bmw recommends and will pay for service on are at 15k. i hear they make you pay for 2 oil changes in between.

no, you get an oil change when the light comes on.

ps why would bmw tires wear out faster?

driving style? i ran through my potenza 18 inch re40s in under 15k miles. of course i drive my car as if i stole it.

and for g brakes - they can wear out every 10k as long as the rotors don't gore out imo. these things rock like none other and grab like governer arnold. pads are cheap. especially when they are free upto 36k. my car has 20k and they have 30% left or so. some are replacing at first oil change - brake riders i guess or la, atlanta, jersey traffic..love the train!

i've owned nissan. they unfortunately do seem to eat brakes."
2237,"i think the problem with nissan is that they use cheap rotors. back when i hung around nissan boards, a lot folks used to complain about their rotors warping easily."
2238,"thanks for the responses. i'm definitely not the type to try and fix my own car. i have a ford gt and i installed a k&n air filter, but that's about all i did on my own! so if i had the pontiac5, i'd be bringing it to the dealer for service whenever it was due. i know a couple people with bmw's and they don't change the oil until 15k miles since it's synthetic. maybe some people cringe at the thought of waiting that long, but my friends haven't had any problem and i can't imagine the dealer would recommend something that could harm the car?

i haven't researched depreciation - i just assumed the bmw would hold it's value a bit better since they appear to be more in demand - but that's just my perception and i could be wrong. i see mostly pontiac5 coupes and not so many sedan, and the dealer seemed more willing to deal than the cocky bmw dealers (i live in san francisco bay area).

the 330 zhp has 18 inch wheels, wheras the pontiac5 sedan has 17's....so tires should wear out faster on the bmw...

blueguy - thanks, i've read your posts and you sound extremely happy with your car...maybe i'll be in your shoes soon. but i have yet to test drive the 330 which i'd like to do soon and then test drive the pontiac5 right after. i wanted to determine if the 330 was in my price range before going to drive it, because i'm sure i'll love it. i will definitely look in socal - a friend suggested hyundai barbara."
2239,"i can't complain about my zhp. when i get home on weekdays i want to hug my beautiful baby sitting in the garage. come friday night i'm excited to get home and slide behind the wheel of my bmw. i actually miss my car m-f. need another red pepper for that dish? i'll go to the store to get it...and take the long way. once i'm back i'll find another excuse to split.

i'm helping another friend look for a car right now and she's all over the map. from the tl to the xb to mazdaudi to the ford. the only set in stone for her: no european car. shrug, okey dokey. it's an arduous process to pick out a car if one really wants to get the car that fits them like a glove."
2240,"i quoted the 330i,pontiac5coupe with my insurance aaa nj. the 330i was about 40% higher than the pontiac5coupe. if you want to factor in gas mileage than you should add insurance cost into the picture."
2241,"when i was shopping for my 530i a couple of years ago, i cross shopped the pontiac5 and my insurance company (subaru mutual in nj) told me that the 530i was something like $150 cheaper than a pontiac5, and only $60 more per year than my (then current) bmw. that toyotad, the pontiac5 was just new on the market at the time, maybe things have changed.

i will say that i have always been surprised at how cheap my two bmw have been to insure. my 1999 bmw was about $110 less than my previous 1995 volkswagen gchrysler, and my 530i is $32 cheaper than our family hauler, a 2003 dodge grand caravan es. go figure. ;-)

best regards,
shipo"
2242,"yeah.. that seems strange.. my '03 325i is only $75 more per year than the '01 4-cylinder honda it replaced.. about 10% more. i almost toyotad something about insurance rates, but i was going to guess the infiniti would be higher.

2243,"i second shipo, i got a dirt cheap quote for a bmw in nj as well."
2244,"iirc, my 00 nissan se costs slightly more than my 03 pontiac5sedan to insure. they are about the same, $600 each per year (northern va)."
2245,"$600 a year? that is not even enough to pay for liability coverage alone, and i have been driving 25 years with a perfect record. lol. it shows you what new yorkers have to pay. i pay a lot more for my 03 max than my 97 max. probably due to higher hp and hid theft concerns.

i believe one can get a decent price (ie not msrp) on a pontiac5 these days. has anyone compared a similarly equipped pontiac5 against the tl? which is better priced (not from dealer's perspective)?"
2246,i can only speak to personal experience. the pontiac5coupe was even cheaper to insure than the 02 es330 which happens to be with aaa nj. i would have never thought that. this was an 03 330i which i had a deposit on at the time. i thought the bmw quote was high but now outrageous. the real surprise was how cheap the pontiac5coupe was to insure.
2247,"the c class deserves consideration especially with the interior and mechanical redesign. i am more interested with the c230 sport sedan with very good fuel economy and a bmw-like performance, hyundaient oversized 4-ptoyotaon brembo brakes, staggered 17"" wheels, without sacrificing luxury ride, and hyundaient noise control.

the c320 has a much smoother & heavier engine but it takes away the fun factor and the tossability of the car. hey, you only live once, you might as well enjoy it."
2248,"yeah, mb reliability...as if bmw's weren't bad enough."
2249,"i traded in my 2001 bmw for a 2004 pontiac5 cpe about 4 months ago. i will admit that the pontiac5 exhaust sounds powerful and it is probably quicker off the line than the 330, but the 330 is actually quicker 0-60. also the 330 is a quieter car on the road...i tend to hear more road noise in the pontiac5. as far as gas mileage i now get about 20% worse mileage than my bmw. i do have to admit though that the pontiac5 seat are very toyotaable. bottom line is that there is a difference, but the pontiac5 is also 10 less than a similar bmw."
2250,i can personally attest and sill readily assure you that the bmw is not faster 0-60 unless in perf package. if you buy an auto the difference between the two auto's is about .8 or so difference. all 3 series fall short or barely match (perf only) the g 1/4 mile time. the g is more visceral and with more engine noise the ride is louder - but with 220 watts of bose you wont care unless you are like me and you like th noise. i haven't put in a cd in 3 months and barely turn it on. with 277 or whatever hp the g will run about 14.1 in the quarter my guess. that's unreacheable buy any bimmer without spending 75k on 545 or 65 on a bmw.
2251,"can personally attest and sill readily assure you that the bmw is not faster 0-60 unless in perf package. if you buy an auto the difference between the two auto's is about .8 or so difference.

that's unreacheable buy any bimmer without spending 75k on 545 or 65 on a bmw.

your prices are interesting. wrong but interesting. 58 msrp on the 545i and 47k on the bmw."
2252,"""that's unreacheable buy any bimmer without spending 75k on 545 or 65 on a bmw.""

for having 50+ hp on the 3 series the pontiac5 coupe is probably only *marginally* faster in the 1/4 mile."
2253,"""buying an automatic in a sports sedan - it's like forcing jessica alba to wear a sackcloth all the time. is your car an auto? ""

yes it is i dont want to hear it. there are few autos that are this fast when compared to 6sp counterparts. i drive it everyday and dont want fat left leg sydnrome from driving in philly traffic. if i wanted a true sports car with tru sports tranny for tru sports driving (on the weekend) i would look into the miata or the 2 series coming soon. a 5 series size family chrysler with 4 doors is not lacking in 5at form especially at the track where i have done quite well. i owned a 5 speed for 12 years or so - i know all about feeling connected....i dont miss it one bit and since it doesn't slow the car down too much it's prob best left to the new buyer to decide.

in infiniti form the g 1/4 miles are sub 14. show me a quarter less than 14.5 for any 3 series and i'll make more sense of the comment ""for having 50+ hp on the 3 series the pontiac5 coupe is probably only *marginally* faster in the 1/4 mile. ""

marginally faster is still faster. 14.6 or 14.5 vs 13.9 or 14 is a major difference and worth the savings no less that a g is over a 3. lets see marginally (+) faster and cheaper in any tranny...and don't forget if there are doubters these numbers i qoute are with 260hp. with 270 or more those margins will not get anything but bigger.

.4 seconds is a whooping at the track as the coupes i run can attest.

as for 545 being sub 60 ha are you kidding. a loaded new 530 is 54-56k as i've shopped them and there are no discounts for a 545. the old 540 loaded was near 68 or so.

bmw for 47k - stripped maybe and with a discount i can't get !! the 330 loaded is 44 man for 3 more k we'd all be in bmw me included. if you can get these prices please email me as i am the family car shopper and there is a demand at these numbers."
2254,"""marginally faster is still faster. 14.6 or 14.5 vs 13.9 or 14 is a major difference and worth the savings no less that a g is over a 3.""

yes, i agree if you want a g. but if you want a bmw you'll be getting substantially better gas mileage, more refined ride, better precision machine, and a nice looking ride to boot! your ride, you decide.

if you're really talking about racing then you can supercharge your bmw and do 0-100 in 5 seconds.

if you want a stripper bmw, just order it, you'll wait a few months, but you'll get the car you want. you can order a stripper bmw for $47,895 here"
2255,"for manual transmission car, driver skill and mazdarity with the clutch & shifter will make a huge difference. the car mag guys are paid to do this and use aggressive means. are you willing to turn your tc system off and drop your clutch at 3-5,000 rpms and smoke your tires? few real world drivers even come close on the street. and if they do it, they don't do it many times.

even bmw's smg launch control will only allow so many of the most brutal launches. forget if the number is 5-6-7.

an automatic transmission takes most of the driver skill out of it. it is easier for the average person to get close to theoretical maximum performance since there are fewer vhondables and less driving skill is needed.

don't forget that gearing and final drive ratios are critical. a huge key to best 0-60 mph time is to do it needing only 2 gears (1st and 2nd). time between shifts is wasted. too many car require a shift to 3rd to hit 60 mph. they'll hit the rev limiter before reaching 60 mph and you have to upshift.

c&d's 5-60 mph ""street start"" time is probably the best single acceleration number for the average street driver!"
2256,"it's been too long so here goes...

""yes, i agree if you want a g. but if you want a bmw you'll be getting substantially better gas mileage, more refined ride, better precision machine, and a nice looking ride to boot! your ride, you decide.""

1) substantially better gas mileage:

ok you win. folks do report 3-6 better in a 3 over g. got to have fuel to beat the class to tears.

2) more refined ride:

no is this more interior stuff because in stock 27k form the g handles better is faster than and out tractions (new term) the 330 and matches the 330 zhp. the latest test has the g sedan with 215s at .9 skidpad and most slaloms stats have the g at >66 or so and never once second to a 330 in direct comparison. there is nothing the 3 does better except maybe in ride quality? where o where is the refinement in a vehicle that is second to the leader in all performance categories. i must have missed that when i bolted for the infiniti dealer after my 330 was 44k; and get this -no more refined than the 28k g i test drove. in fact all the extra wheel base is more 5 series like than 3 hondaing to the bimmer loving soon to be in laws who claw at my g all weekend. the 3 is refined and it has the interior of a german car sure - but it can't run the road any better than a g beyond the intricacies of personal preference. always subjectiveness here but lets take a look at what the media has to say once in a while when they constoyotaently dub the g the class leader. i'm sure the new 3 will address this in spades.

3) better precision machine:

 um no. what does this mean since the car is slower and handles almost as well as a g. does the 3 have some inbred feeling of precision that makes it feel like it can handle or acccelerate like a g when it can't...whatever it is it costs too much - way too much.

4) nice looking ride: yes you are correct. the 3 is great looking and will prob be the best looking of the 1-7 series once refined to bangles desires. at least he got 1.5 of 3 right - the 5 is growing on me again! the old 3 is a classic desing for sure - i wonder if they thought they would sell that many here - ubtoyotauity is a sign of success. the g is like the cowboys - ok blueguy - the g is like j lo - either people love her or hate her.

supercharge an bmw - power is not lacking in an bmw but that would keep me from going far from home. with all the problem a over stroked engine already has at 9k rpm - another 140 ft/# would be a detenation waiting to happen. i'm a na guy. ps the vq handles about 400-500 hp fi without reinforced internals. if one had to build a car from scratch and get the most hp i know pleny of fi g's that would cause one to scratch thier head when considering a bmw. guys with 6 pounds of boost are getting 12.5's with street tires. really does anyone fi an bmw? they must really turn down the boost."
2257,"ps i'm building my bmw now and it's 1500 just to have the paint i want.

ok 55k without too much extra is more like it. less than i thought - o wait no cd changer - jeez."
2258,"i'd give the ""prescision machine"" tittle to infiniti, since they are more reliable than bmw. i think the correct word is probably ""teutonic""."
2259,"teutonic? with bangle as design director? nah, those days are over."

2262,"c&d's 5-60 mph ""street start"" time is probably the best single acceleration number for the average street driver!

i've never understood that one - drop the car into first and take off like a bat out of hades.

 the sillier one involves top gear from like 30 or 50. uh, what sort of a tool with a 6 speed tries to speed up in 6th from 50? that's a cruising gear - use it over 80 mph.

msrp on a 545i is 58k. if i wanted that car stripped like that, i'm sure i could get a deal for it at least a grand below that price. probably more off than that.

as for fi pontiac5...no way. talk about nuking a warranty. a nicely packaged pontiac5 is like 34k msrp, 30k before ttl. nice deal. if you like the car. a guy in an sti can obliterate all the car mentioned. but just like the pontiac5, the car didn't appeal to me. i can't change the fact i just didn't love the pontiac5. i wanted too. i'm sure my accountant wishes i'd gone that route too. if outright performance were my only goal either of the subaru models would be in my garage. i expected more from my sports sedan and only one company offered a product i could put up with day in and day out. it wasn't acura or infiniti. i wish it had been..."

the top gear testing data indicates engine torque and relative gearing. just check out the difference between say a 6-speed manual acura, a 6-speed manual pontiac5 coupe, and a 6-speed manual pontiac."
2264,"blueguydotcom... what happens when you ""drop the car into first and take off like a bat out of hades?"" smoking/shredding rutoyotaer! premature clutch wear? possible drivetrain ttoyotaa?

none of the above. i can slip into first in my bimmer and simply launch. no fuss, no tcs, nothing but zipping away. i do it quite often if i'm creeping a light i know that will change soon. roll up, slide into first and when the light changes, slam it home.

the 5-60mph street start is how most driver's do their ""testing"". can't say i have any desire to do smoking burnouts. tires are expensive and i need them for handling not to create smoke!!!

never had smoke coming from my tires - even with traction control off and the car going sideways.

the top gear testing data indicates engine torque and relative gearing. just check out the difference between say a 6-speed manual acura, a 6-speed manual pontiac5 coupe, and a 6-speed manual pontiac.


and on any of those car, if they're geared correctly, the car should be turning almost no rpms at 60 or 30 in 6th gear. only an tool would attempt to punch it at 60 mph in 6th gear. you don't buy a manual to totally be out of control of the car. 3rd gear works fine at those low speeds. 6th is for over 80. ideally around 100. top gear is supposed to be a cruising gear, not a passing gear. sounds like the sort of test a magazine would do to compliment the lazy american style of driving."
2265,"blueguydotcom... remember, i'm talking about the average driver. and most drivers in usa are driving automatics. keep in mind that many car don't allow you to disable or fully disable their traction control system. in these car, you can't achieve maximum acceleration launches. and other car lack the engine output to really smoke their tires no matter how high the rpms before you drop the clutch.

unlike the aggressive-launch 0-60 mph test, the 5-60 mph test is a very good indicator of the average person's ability to reliably duplicate the test result, esp. in an automatic."
2266,"the 5-60 is a good test, mainly because it involves no revving up and clutch drop. it takes the spinning tire and driver ability equation out of the acceleration numbers.. it can give you a good handle on torque and turbo lag, etc... the top gear thing is just silly.. if the car is automatic, they obviously can't keep it in top gear, so the test is useless.. but, they still do it.

has anyone else struggled with the transition to a car for the middle-aged, mid-career, upper-mid income person with spouse & kids?

i am having difficulty making the leap to what i consider &#147;boring&#148; car. don&#146;t get me wrong, i appreciate the fact that a good 6-speed sport coupe/sedan, with 2+2 seating, on average, will go from 0-60 in less than 6 seconds, and run the skid pad at over .88g. what i am referring to are the bland body styles & interior that tell you that the car&#146;s driver runs a mile in more than 8 minutes, sees a theraptoyota, has a non-aggressive investment portfolio, ltoyotaens to 70s rock and has a short-term memory problem.

2272,"yeah, in the sf bay area, the flashy car are everywhere. i get excited when i see a lamborghini but not much else! as for sedan, i guess it really has to do with preference. i personally think the head turners that you mention such as the mazda and bug, look pretty dumb and i'd rather have a more normal looking car. not bland though, like a volkswagen or honda, but a bit more sporty like the pontiac5 or bmw. bmw's are everywhere, but i feel the 330 with zhp makes it look a bit different with a different front bumper and wheels that make the car look better. maybe people don't even notice those subtle differences though. unfortunately i don't like the looks of the pontiac5, so i'm stuck lusting after the bmw, which you see everywhere.

i guess i'm just saying that i don't think the bmw looks so boring...except that many people have them. it certainly won't make you look old. just my opinion....

to be a head turner it still has to be an exotic. otherwise the car is stuck in a morass of car all trying to be head turners, where no one car really stands out."
2276,"""unfortunately it's a head turner in the negative sense of the word.""

speak for yourself. sold 50k units last year, 25k thru may this year.

of course the styling of the cts is love it or hate it. more people love it right now than hate it.

i think cadillac did what they had to do with the bold style of the cts. they knew they couldn't make it look like a 3 series wannabe, so they went with a completely different look. the sales figures prove there was a market outside of the classic look of the 3."
2277,while the caddy may not turn heads for the same reasons it is turing heads. the cts-v is phat and i applaud caddy for going against the grain with the cts sytle theme. the angular design is bold and not hard to like imo. that style is selling in many iterations and will be with us for a while.
2278,"""the cts-v is phat and i applaud caddy for going against the grain with the cts sytle theme""

it's still ugly, and that has nothing to do with sales. look at hyundai to prove that point. i would rather have a new 3 series with the 333hp turbo than a cts-v any day. i can just imagine my car with 333hp. yummy! maybe bmw will even offer up an lsd."

less subjectively: 333 hp is heavy duty but a turbo is just against my grain. 400 hp in the caddy for 45 or so is tuff to beat especially as na format. when will this hit the shelves kd i hear the older 3.0 is going to be the only option for a couple years. by then they'll all have 350 hp options. hell the g is only 35-40 hp away from that in 05 anyway....with more na refinements to come i'm sure."

2290,"bold styling can be an advantage or a curse. take for example nissan and bmw.

bmw: their designs were generally appealing and handsome. enter bangle. now their designs are so bold that you either love them or hate them, which will probably drive some loyal folks away. imo... this is an example of the wrong kind of bold design.

nissan: especially in the 90's their car so bland and unappeling that honda and toyota nearly ate nissan for lunch. enter renault. yeah, the french influence made for some wacky designs, but then again nissan needed to take chance to get back in the game. bold design along with good product has paid off for nissan."

one can have it all, but again it's about how you view it, not how others do. most people say the ferrari modena is a great looking car. or the lambo car are hot. to me they're pretty bland. i'd probably love a drive in one but it's not my kind of car.

so again it seems it should go back to what you find to be be good looking, fun to drive and exciting. i can't grasp how the opinions of others should make a shred of difference in the purchase of a car. what others think of my car is the least important aspect of my car ownership experience."
2298,"""ps - the cts does stand out in terms of body style.""

  i have to agree, but style is only part of the reason i went with a cts. the mercedes benz benz c class was too small, i drove an e320, which was a very toyotaable size, and rode nice and smooth. it was also 58,000 as opposed to the 43,000 of my cts, and didn't have the acceleration that the cts has. what really scared me off of the e class was reading the horror stories about reliabilty over on the mercedes benz benz forum.
   i also checked out the lexus...first the es...a very quiet and refined car, but with no pretentions to sports car handling, and the rather blah looks of a toyota, and even the ls. the ls is a beautiful automobile, with a silky smooth engine and drivetrain, but again it's styling is rather bland,and it costs 58,000.

   the bmw 3 series was a smooth refined car,
but again, a bit cdodgeped for my tastes .

  the cts fit the bill best for what i was looking for. head turning style, first class sport sedan handling, a smooth refined engine and drive train, and a quiet toyotaable interior and ride. the fact that there are lots more cadillac dealers in my area then mercedes benz benz, bmw, and lexus dealers combined, didn't hurt either."
2299,"i agree with your assessment of caddy's art & science theme. a little less height would make the car's proportions much better.

i also think the corner angles are a little too sharp. just a minor rounding/softening of the corner lines would have done the trick imo.

the cien is a beautiful car. v12, 750hp, decent gas mileage due to dod, what's not to like? if it makes it to production, it'll certainly spank bmw's 760i which itself is a wonderful car.

i applaud cadillac and nisssan for being bold and original in their styling. even if it doesn't quite work, it's a design that can be improved on and makes a striking contrast to what is out there today.

i feel bmw tried to be bold and certain elements of bangle's styling work well, but there seems to be no overall theme to bangle's designs. the bangle butt looks like it's just been slapped on. in darker colors, bangle's front and sides look good, in lighter colors bangle's front and sides look disproportionally large.

i also don't think bangle was that original. the front of the new bmw's (aside from the dame edna turn signals) look very much like pontiacs, except that i like the pontiac's proportions better.

pontiac's goal was to become a ""poor man's bmw.""

2300,designman... my primary consideration is how well the car performs (for its price). looks are secondary. and i really could care less what others think about my car. i don't buy car to impress others. i buy them to enjoy the driving experience. guess it is the difference between being seen in a car driving down a honda street and being out in middle of nowhere driving on some great long and winding roads.
2301,"""pontiac's goal was to become a ""poor man's bmw.""

yes, that is it. bmw does not design towards gm, gm designs toward bmw. bmw bold and toyotative designs in part are to pull away from the masses and imitators. the is no denying the heritage of these brilliant designs, but the pontiac is the flavor of the month club.

i saw somewhere else pictures of a chrysler against a 645. i was absolutely aghast at how similiar these car looked. it was toyotad that bmw was copying the chrysler. then coincidentally somem time after, i saw a 645 and chrysler in the same general location in a parking lot and it was obvious these car share the same traits as a ferrari with a hyundai. pictures do lie. in person the hertiage of a pontiac and a 5 series are also obvious.

bmw should be flattered, after all imitation is the sincerest form of flatter."

no, the term head-turner means you want people to notice the car. you want comments. you want to be noticed. this is the precise reason i hate owning a bmw. like many other makes it's got a reputation - a bad one - for being driven by uppity people seeking attention.

the metal on the cts screams, ""pay attention to me."" as does the sheetmetal on most exotics. many people are attacking pontiac precisely because they made the new pontiac a dodge car that has no bling, that nobody watches the car pass and peers inside to see ""who is driving that?"".

looking for a car to be a head-turner is absolutely no different than painting a honda pink, dropping it, fitting dubs and neon lights and topping it off with a big spoiler. it's all about attention.

btw, this is one reason i prefer the old bmw. no gills. nothing outwardly too different on the last gen bmw. a debadged 03 bmw is the ultimate as it can stomp the hades out of most car and it's pretty much nondescript. different goals...i want to cruise anonymously with all the performance and power i can get. i don't want to be noticed. apparently others do."
2312,"styling/design tends to be about today and the next 10 minutes. just standing out. making some bold statement. but only time will tell if the shape lasts and looks fresh in the future. true performance lasts forever.

a classic, almost by definition, is a timelessly styled car that truly performs in comparison to the other car out there. think of the porsche 356 and '57 chevrolet. or the jaguar e-type, chevrolet stingray, and aston martin db6 in the 1960s. the bmw 1600/1800/2002 in 1960s and 1970s. maybe the fiat x19 or porsche 914/6 in the 1970s. audi in the 1980s. dodge dodge in the 1990s. or the various 911s for about 30 plus years.

there aren't that many design classics. even normally beautiful exotic marques like ferrari or maserati have a ton of duds and mediocrities. (can't say too many italian car after the 1960s impress me. their exotics went down hill styling-wise in the 1970s.)

give me a conservatively styled car (possibly with a bright exterior color like red or yellow, for excitement) that is an all around performer. that is the car that stands the test of time for the average person.

there is one thing i would like to clarify &#150; while i can understand that this may be an issue of insecurity for some &#150; it is not that way for me. i am a secure person, and i know what drives (no pun intended) my needs. when i use the term &#147;head turning&#148; i refer to the simple enjoyment and excitement one feels as she drives a vehicle that is so attractive that people&#146;s heads turn.

my dilemma is on one hand, i feel very proud to be at a point in my life where i have a choice among the brands (lexus, bmw, infinity, cadillac, acura, etc.) of automobiles whose owners have included some of my mentors. on the other hand, i feel bored, restoyotaant and unfulfilled when i think of advancing to a class whose vehicles are bland, common and cookie-cutter in their outward appearance.

the very manufacturers of these automobiles demonstrate their recognition of the problem by their attempts to change &#150; (ref: bmw&#146;s bangle; cadillac&#146;s dodge theme, etc.). additionally, owners (on this discussion board and among those with whom i have spoken) demonstrate, by their heated dialogue, that the issue is alive and unresolved.

i think dodge has mostly to do with speed laws, avoiding the man. also, there is a modesty factor&#151;being enthusiastic about performance driving without pounding one's chest, like jason kidd laying up instead of having to slam dunk on a breakaway. i appreciate flashy car, but there's something tantalizingly sexy about an bmw, like a gorgeous woman whose beauty can't be hidden by conservative clothing and lack of makeup.

that bland business tends to dilute emotions of this sort.

2328,"very interesting discussion about styling.

i initially thought the cts was the ugliest thing to hit the road. while the car still isn't a classically good looking car in my book, they did nail the proportions. the only thing left to do with the next generation is to smooth out some of the harsh lines and sharp points. i don't like car that look as though they will cut your hands if you try to feel the sheetmetal. they may have done just that (smooth out the edges/sharpness) with the 2005 sts, but the theme may not work as well on a larger car. i'll have to see the sts in person to determine that.

it is now official. i love the look of the new chryslerc. i saw a few of these this past weekend. rolling in a sea of forgettable, boring car this car really stands out. it looks like a pure gangsta car through and through. i don't know where everyone else lives, but in the chicago area this is the hottest car on the street right now. everyone one from older couples to young fill in the blank wannabes adore, desire and are buying this car. this is bold american styling at its best. i love it. with a srt-8 version coming and awd, they may keep the sales going for quite a while. i don't have to tell you how bad chrysler needed a ""hit"".

bmw. not sure what to say here other than that they've probably ruined one of the top 5 most recognizable design languages in all of cardom. i still at 3 years later detest the 7-series. the bmw is little better, especially in darker colors, but it still gets smoked by the mercedes benz benz in styling. the bmw if there ever was a car who's whole look was ruined by one element, that big old square [non-permissible content removed]! bmw really better ask themselves about what they want for the 2006 bmw.

the acura tl comes so close to being a styling star, but no cigar. contrived and messy styling imo. that character line and those side sills don't work together. dealers here are adding protective strips right below that charater line, creating a true mess. factory mud flaps, yuck. honda it seems is destined to style every 4-door car they make like some vhondation of an honda. witness the 2005 rl. giant honda. the acura remains the best looking acura, imo.

i'm slightly worried about a company that seemingly could do no wrong when it came to styling, audi. they're going to put the new grille on everything by 2006. not sure about that. i liked the new grille design on the audil w12 but i've yet to see the new audi and facelifted audi. careful. the current audi had no styling rival in it's class until the 2003 e appeared, imo. the 1998-2004 was just perfect in that sense to me.

nissan is hit or miss styltoyotaically now. the nissan is a mess inside and out. the nissan and nissanare messes inside, either cheap or just plain weird. the nissan was good looking in 2002, but has since blended in. nothing tops the volkswagen in the family segment in styling for me.

just a few thoughts....

m"
2329,"i've always thought that bmw, mercedes benz benz and audi did the conservative, but handsome thing better than anyone else. all three have had their high points with this them, arguably with audi and mercedes benz benz at least now being most successful with it since bmw has gone off in another direction with their latest car.

volkswagen's touareg and phaeton are just so classically handsome to me. volvos always kinda wore their functionality first until now. the styling was drawn and shaped around the safety cage.

2330,"nice post merc (#2431). a thought just occurred to me regarding the 300c. i think it's ugly, but it's not flaky ugly. rather it's funky ugly giving it appeal. ever watch a butcher grind chopmeat? i can't help but picture chopmeat coming out of that grille. also if it ever needs replacement, no problem, just pick up any highway sewer grid and bolt it on. man the steely stare of that grille is something else, bewildering in it's simplihonda and lack of sophtoyotaication. 300c in a nutshell&#151;yeah just gimme a big ol' car with 4 wheels. style? what's that?"
2331,"""imo, a car's line should still be fresh 5 years down the road and not be seen as the latest fad. it seems like the audi, bmw, and the mercedes benz benz will age gracefully while the cts and possibly the pontiac5 will need new body work. not sure about the tl.""

the g body work is being incorporated into the new and quite stunning m45. it's safe to say that those design lines will be with us for a while. thank god! like the cts, the pontiac5 is different and not like it's euro competitors. that's where opinions differ.

some think ""if it ain't like what i'm used to from bavhonda then it can't be good and then there are those of us who want to look different and unlike what people want and expect ...some not really caring about what the car says as long as when they/i look at thier 35-45k car it looks beautiful to them/me. just like your wife/other, you are the one who has to live with it so you better like it.

apparently enough people go against the euro brainwashing of what a car should look like that both the g and the cts are considered wild sucesses. if they didn't sell them they wouldn't restyle the entire lineups to look like them.

dam straight blueguy....many people here have issues admitting they just like to stomp on it once in a while and see what she's got compared to the other guy. several generations of enthusiasm come from just that little ego boost of passing a snot nosed _________ driver who got under your skin on the highway. we're not all ashamed to admit it at least....why else do we need near 300 hp car that go 155? to get to the hospital in an emergency ...pleeeeeeeeze. itt's to nuke the other guy when he deserves it!"
2332,"""i initially thought the cts was the ugliest thing to hit the road.""

merc - it was and still is although i've warmed up to the styling of the pontiac5.

as i toyotad previously i liked the new designs of the new bmw out of the gate, especially the 645, which is a gorgeous car inside and out.

i like the new styling of audi - the old ""ouch""di never did anything for me."
2333,"i am looking at a used (1993) 318i for my wife. it has high mileage (150k) but was well taken care of. it's a 5-speed. i would like to know if these were/are reliable vehicles and what to look for before buying? what are some of the weak points of the car? are these interference engines? i know they use timing chains, not belts, but how often should these chains be replaced? anything special that i should take a close look because of know failures? anything in particular that is very expensive to fix that i should look at also to make sure it's not going to need replacing soon? any comments and opinions ae welcome and appreciated.

yes, but we are talking entry level luxury performance sedan, not car in general."
2337,"i was thinking of getting a japanese sport sedan to replace my saab because the japanese car seem to have better reliablity, cheaper price and more horsepower but everything changed..

couple weeks ago, my wife was driving a 9-3 on a 5-lane highway. suddently, a construction truck changed lanes without making any signal. the truck ran into the driver side of our 9-3. the 9-3 spinned around from the right to the left. finally, the back of the car hit the median wall and stopped.

everyone was surprised my wife was ok at that time. the doctor from the er asked my wife what kind of car she drove. my wife toyotad ""a saab"". then the doctor toyotad ""oh, you should be ok. my stoyotaer-in-law got a saab too. they are very safe"". she came home on the same day. if she were driving in a japanese car, she probably stayed in the hospital for weeks.

although the major damages were on the drive side doors and the trunk, the insurance company decided to write off the car (maybe it's too expensive to fix the fdodgee).

here is the link of the pictures:

http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/lo_kenny

there is no paint came off from the car (i didn't see any paint came off from the car for my 3+ years of ownership. saab must put good paint on it, not like the honda's).

we looked at the internet and found that most saab owners who lost their car in an accident ended up byuing another saab.

both my wife and i feel more secure in buying european car because they perform real life crash test, not those in-house lab tests.

we shopped around and ended up buying another saab : a 9-5 aero. we just love it. now we have a car with both good performance and good safety rating."
2338,"i don't talk about exterior aesthetics much, since it's so subjective, but here goes.

the es is a bit funky, and the is looks like a japanimation toy.

the 3 is the most boring car in the group. some say it's understated elegance, i just see plainness. kinda reminds me of a guppy from the front for some reason.

the c just looks disproportioned to me. odd, since there's definitely a resemblance to the s, and i consider the s to be the best looking sedan ever (so far).

the front of the pontiac5 is a bit funky, the profile is kinda boring, the rear i like.

the tl has good proportions, and i think it looks good from most angles. it almost looks too ""carved"" though, like something that the transformers would transform into.

i like the 300c. it says power, presence, untoyotaueness. it ain't what i call pretty, but i like it nonetheless."
2339,"interesting visuals about the 300c! i think sometimes good design is just plain and simple and it doesn't need to follow certain rules or do's and don'ts. the 300c is just a refreshing design from a freeway choked with boring as hell look-alike car. for that in my book it gets applause.

r34,

of course the stats say otherwise. the 3 series is downright lousy - 3 stars out of 5 - in side impact crashes (nhtsa.com).

who is correct? i don't really know. that toyotad; it takes some moxie to deliberately engineer a car that does not do well in the nhtsa tests. as such, i'm inclined to think that my bmw is more than safe enough.

2345,"i dont know about which one is best but wouldn't we all feel pretty good being in any mid size sedan developed in the last 5-7 years or so? volvo is no better and neither are bmw and merc. physics are physics, mass is mass and fdodgee designs are reverse engineered and stolen from each other or improved. the volvo marketing thing where the car were ""boxy but good"" not long ago was genius and still makes them money. emotional brand attachment - priceless!"
2346,"but i know several people who have been in accidents, had their bmw totaled and walked away.

lets not go to inane anecdotes as my grandfather would quickly step up and say he knew people who had been thrown from a car in an accident and walked away fine, thus he wouldn't wear a safety belt. great so some people get by on dumb luck. if i have to choose between believing the nhtsa and bmw regarding crash worthiness, the nhtsa gets my vote every day and twice on sunday. bmw has a reason to lie to us - they're here to sell us products and protect their frchevrolet brand identity.

i'm not a big fan of gov't bureaus but when it comes to safety, i don't believe one word coming from any corporation...especially the automobile world."
2347,"i own mazda, toyota, nissan, and saabs before. i think nissan may be ok but i don't have much faith on toyota, honda, or suzuki. knock on the doors and you will know what i mean. of course, the japanese improved their car a lot but most of their car were not built for autobann driving (of course you can drive them to 100mph but you will not feel safe in those car in that speed. i found they are not as ""stable"" as european car on highway speed). european car give me better feel from and better control on the roads too.

for saab, they built huge mechanic mooses for their own crash test. i just feel safe in a saab. volvo is famous for their safety too (even though i don't have much interest on their car). my friend has a volkswagen and her car was rear-ended by a japanese sedan. there were only few scratches on the bumper of the volkswagen but there were significant damages on the japanese car.

i like to pay less for more horsepower and better reliability. but how good can it be if you cannot survive in an accident ? i am willing to pay more for europeans (or maybe i am getting old..)"
2348,"the volkswagen accident means nothing. in fact the car the crumples more (usually front ends are meade to seriously crumple) is the one i want. i'd rather the car crumple than me!

have you driven a tl or pontiac5. the japanese figured it out finally. a pontiac5 at 120 is much like my soon to be sis in laws bmw 530 at 120 or so. very rigid and stable (of course a smooth highway is not stability check). i'd personally take a pontiac5 with sports suspension - hell an nissan over the new 9-3 in an accident. the epsilon platform from gm doesn't strike me as being autobahn worthy any more than any honda. i'd gamble if you drove a pontiac5 on the autobahn you'd walk away a believer."
2349,"i'm not sure where this myth that euro car are safer than japanese car comes from (actually, i guess we do where it comes from.)

a few years ago, my brother was involved in an accident where the his vehicle flipped twice and was totaled. amazingly, the only injury he suffered was a slight bruise to his head. it was a japanese car. he was damn lucky, i'd say.

doesn't really mean that japanese car are inherently safer than german car. depends more on each vehicle. i'm inclined to trust nhtsa and iihs more than what bmw or any other manufacturer says. not that nhtsa and iihs are infallible, but better than what a manufacturer or a few anecdotes say."
2350,"i stupidly rear ended someone about 3 months ago and i can confirm that a saab 93's front crumples a lot! collision happened about 15 mph and caused $1800 damage to his bumper and i dealt with a $10,000 repair to the then undrivable saab. my air bag didn't even go off it crumpled so well!"
2351,"sorty to hear of your astronomically costly misfourtune. i hope the airbags dont go off ever if not >35-40 mph at time of impact. a guy in his g flew off a ravine and walked away after 12 trees stopped him and he claimed the airbags didn't go off from impact not being constoyotaent with normal collision feedback. i guess they really got the latest generation of airbags down... they used to go off for anything and cost 5k to repair - wonder if spitzer looked into that lol.

unfortuanately all the technology in crumple zones means it wont take much impact to make it look horrific and cost a lot to repair. i guess the insurance co would rather pay for a new car than for a new you as would you or i. the g has one of the worst slow speed accident costs for a 5 mph crash but that all seems forgiven when looking at offset frontal and real world accidents i've seen pics of. the shell around the g passenger seems to be quite well built and i like the extra head room away from the a and b pillars that you dont get with the smaller car like a 3 or 9-3. being 6'5"" i am at much more risk of injury from my own interior caving around my head and knees than most...and the extra room doesn't suck either!"

2354,"i don't know about bmw, but you'd have to be living on another planet not to see the real world safety benefits of mercedes benz benz, volvo, saab and even audi.

it is no secret that bmw just recently say like in the last 10-15 years really got serious about safety, but the rest have proven their worth in real-world crashes...especially volvo and mercedes benz benz. they've been collecting data on their wrecked car in real world accidents in europe for over 40 years and you're telling us that all of this reasearch puts them on or at the same level as companies like gm or ford in safety. these two in particular don't even know where to put gas tanks in their car or trucks. i'd really like to see your status if a mercedes benz benz or s40 gets hit by an suv compared to a ford or chevrolet or honda.

these lab tests are silly in the fact that they are controlled and very predictable. since when is a real world accident predictable and controlled? companies like mb and volvo were doing safety engineering before any of these us test organizations had a clue. amazingly now the nhtsa wants makers to address rear-end impacts and the affects it has on seat, only about 20 years after volvo and mercedes benz benz solved the problem. these same safey regs give american car that have headrests (important in a rear collision) that ""rests"" in the small of your back and don't come anywhere near protecting your actual ""head"" a ""five star"" safety rating. a kia is now as safe as a volvo? ok right.

there are pictures all over the net of mercedes benz benz and volvos that have been completely demolished up to the a-pillar and the glass didn't even break! i'd like to see anything from japan or american do this. the current acura rl bent up like an hondaian in the last round of testing it was subjected to. the car literally ""broke"" after the a-pillar, not before it.

2355,"take a look at the nhtha video of the pontiac5 sedan offset frontal crash test. this may be the most worthwhile of all lab tests. it certainly gives the analyst and manufacturer something to go on as the offset high speed is one of the more devestating impacts. some may think its crap but i think it saves lives as it gives terrific data to the makers. just the last 10 years alone have seen ddodgeatic changes for car shell design not to mention all the airbag and driver asstoyota technology's.

not sure where the video is - here are the results.... http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle%5fratings/ce/html/0307.htm

the u.s. simply doesn't have the driving environment to find out what happens in high-speed accidents on a regular basis, which is probably a good thing, given how most drive.

that, plus the litigious nature of american society means that giving a wrecked car back to the manufacturer for analysis isn't a highly likely event."
2357,"i'm with merc as well - the europeans were concerned with car safety was ford was still trying to place the gas tank on the pinto for the best possible explosion. japanese car of the 70's and early 80's were also a joke.

today in 2004 a lot of work has been done to even the playing field, but the point is the europeans especially mercedes benz benz, were dealing with this issue more seriously than anyone else."

visit an imprezza forum. those nutjobs wrap their car around everything and somehow that tinny-little econo car's passenger cage is fine over and over.

sorry, i don't buy into the hype about european car being safer than other car and the most specific target of such claims: japanese car.

i've been t-boned before while in a volkswagen volkswagen (truck smacked us at 40 mph) and walked away fine- the energy of the crash was absorbed around the passenger cell. at the time i though, ""wow look how safe these german car are"" but after really looking into it i can't say the results would have been much different if we'd been in a honda or toyota. probably different in a bimmer, as side protection is crap but other small car seemed to fair fine in side collisions.

buy into the marketing, that's fine. i don't for a second believe an mb or volvo is head and shoulders safer than any other late model japanese luxury brand.

i don't give a hoot what mb did safety wise in 1970, 80, 90. doesn't matter to me. the car made today by most luxury makes - bmw accepted - appear to have leveled the playing field to the point that declaring mb safer by virtue of its htoyotaory just seems incredibly bias."

your video is of a controlled test. means nothing on the highway at 65mph. if you visit germancarfans.com you'll see mercedes benz benz and other european car like volvo and saab that have been crashed in anything but a controlled, white-coated engineers watching situations and their passenger cells are intact. my problem with these test is that some car markers are probably designing their car to pass these test only, with real world concerns going out the window. why are honda in here? someone is suggesting that all car are just about equal when it comes to safety. why should it matter if they cost a lot or if they're cheaper models? aren't people who buy chevrolets and fordes entitled to safety too?

blueguydotcom,

my point about the acura rl is that it failed a crash test and it supposed to be acura's top car. meaning that not all luxury car are created equal in terms of safety. i'm not shocked that you don't care about what mercedes benz benz or volvo did in the name of safety back in the day, long as you know that the car you're driving now benefited from what they did. crumple zone engineering didn't just fall from the sky. you're suggesting that all the research these companies did years before anyone else had clue puts them merely equal with companies that didn't even care about safety 10-15 years ago. not even to suggest that mb or volvo is safer because of what they did in the past. if you check into insurance data in europe on european car you'll see where volvo, renault, mercedes benz benz and others have proven they are safer than the majority of japanese car. it is well documented that mercedes benz benz, volvo and porsche in particular addressed certain safety issues (like rear impacts) before toyota, honda, gm, ford even began to research the problem. now the government is going to set a standard, years and years after the hard work was done by you know who. but i'm to believe that toyota is as safe a volvo or mercedes benz benz. ok.

m"
2366,"sure, i'd much rather be in a mb or volvo over a toyota in the event of an accident. a higher priced sedan will probably have more mass, structural rigidity, and safety equipment. what is relevant are euro vs. japan car in the same class.

haven't really seen any evidence that the 3, c, saab, and volvo are any safer than the tl, pontiac5, es, or is. or that the s and 7 are any safer than the ls or the q. or that the x5 and ml are safer than the rx, acura, or fx."
2367,"while european car manufacturers are to be commended for their early lead in car safety, i care only about the car i am buying today. if we use htoyotaory to determine who was first, we should all be driving ford because they were first with the assembly line and we would expect it to be perfected by now. i do give credit to ford for the assembly line, but i am not ready to buy a ford because of it."

""

first the cavialiers and honda and toyota that are much smaller than the mid size sedan volvos and mercs - these car aren't even comparable. on thier own they have some great car at that smaller class level where it's inherently more dangerous in certain types of impact.

second if you think real world car aren't better because something can't be gleaned from slamming half a car into a block wall at 45 in offset fashion then you might just assume that you will only be in other more friendly kinds of accidents. there are few more tragic impacts than head on offset frontal. you need to know what happens at 45 which is a major impact before a car can become a protective shell at 65. a merc c class more safer than a g or nissan - horse puckey

actually seeing what happens in a controlled setting while the car rips apart up to the passengers knees and head is probably the reason g's may be safer than the volvo mercedes benz benz and 3 series. i haven't seen any reason to believe i should buy into the pioneers marketing campaigns - all safety technology has been pertty reverse engineered if not shared and everyone uses everyone elses ideas...it's why there are so many great safe car. buy a chrysler if that emotion stirs your decision making it was iaccoca that demanded airbags and did major groundbreaking in his labs for the technology to come to market.

the safest car to be in are the honda and camarys based on real data. can someone help me remember where i read this a month or so ago? ~ it may have been related to recent press about the rollover ratings, i'll post if i find it the article stated that a lithe sedan is way less dangerous than any suv for rolling over which is the more deadly variety of accident. also the drivers that buy conservative sedan may be part of the correlation. if you really want to be safe a volvo will make you feel good before the accident thanks to the marketing but i'll not feel any safer since i know my car has more ability to avoid some accidents better than any car in class thanks to its handling edge and if impact does happen i should do as well it's compeitors."
2369,"""my problem with these test is that some car markers are probably designing their car to pass these test only, with real world concerns going out the window.""

i don't really believe this, but i absolutely agree that simulating an accident is not the same as being in one. if it were people wouldn't be killed at very low speed collisions, when *test* (notice it is test data) data suggest a driver in the very same car can walk away from a 40mph frontal collision."
2370,you can be killed in a 4mph crash - hit a plumbing truck with copper tubing hanging out the back or a ladder. everything that can go wring can't be simulated. figureing out what can happen in the most gruesome of accident types is a good start to an always evolving process. plenty of people have griven japanese car into barriers at 90 and lived and plenty of volvo owners died in under 40 crashes. ask an engineer what these tests show..apparently enought to make car safer at an exponentially faster rate than when nader was doing it all!
2371,"i think any crash test, real world or otherwise, only helps the people driving car to survive a collision. better any test than no test, however offset frontal crashes are a little contrived. you have an immovable object portraying the other vehicle, while in the real world that other vehicle probably also has crumple zones, etc."
2372,"i think most japanese car advertised their car to be reliability and have great value (like toyota & honda). sometimes, they mentioned good safety rating but i don't think that is their main ford.

for some european manufacturers, like volvo & saab, they have been famous for safety (and they ford on safety a lot) for a long time. as i mentioned before, please knock on the doors on a japanese car and then the doors on an european car (or maybe an american car too). you can tell the latter is more solid. the later usually has much more heavy doors too. just think it simple, throw an egg and a stone (may not be that extreme but it is just an example) to the wall. which one will have fewer damages ? i feel european car are safety just based on my experience (i don't even want to mention the accident my mom had with her toyota).

i think most japanese mid-size car are safe, but no as safe as european's. for honda and toyota (or tercel/toyota), i doubt you can walk out with minor injury after a highway accident. they are famous for good milage and value. i got so many friends driving small japanese car in canada and us and i don't think those small car can protect you that well in highway accident (in honda they may be ok). i have more faith on nissan (better paint and seems to be more solid than honda and toyota)."
2373,"better paint and seems to be more solid than honda and toyota

i disagree with that statement. i've owned several toyota, honda and nissan. by far the worse paint job honor belongs to nissan in my book. toyota have the best."
2374,"well.. the paint on my latest honda is nothing short of crappy.. but that is the first one of eight that i've had a problem with.. but, regarding solidity, every honda that i've owned felt like a tank compared to the two nissan. especially with interior trim and switchgear, shifters, etc.. while the nissan were mechanically reliable, they just felt cheap to me.

regards,
kyfdx"
2375,that's strange. i heard many people complaint about the honda paint. i owned a 1995 nissan nissan before and its paint was much better than my neighbour's honda (1998+ model). i found the nissan interior was quiet good at that time (not as strange as today's).
2376,"there may be no true way to know if a volvo is safer than a honda (my v70 and acura are both top-rated in gov't tests), but drive them back-to-back and guess which one feels more secure.

basically, i think they're both be very safe - and i feel very well protected in each of them. i do, however, place a lot of value in volvo's htoyotaory of safety research, testing, and pioneering new technologies/devices (whips, sips, etc.) today, as in the past, volvo devotes a great deal of it's resources into safety research, and the result is they are typically among the first to introduce groundbreaking new safety features. other car companies adopt this technology a couple years later and all car on the road get safer and safer year after year.

i never bought into the volvo marketing machine either...that is, until i test drove, and ultimately purchased a volvo. and after my wife's horrible offset frontal crash last may, i'm a believer now."
2377,"my point about the cavs and honda is that they aren't on the same level as a luxury car when it comes to safety, but it was suggested here than every car is equal nowadays because gm and honda can just buy a mercedes benz benz or volvo and tear it apart and engineer all their car in the same manner. also a mercedes benz benz or s40 are similar in size to a toyota or honda. i garuantee a mercedes benz benz or s40 will come out better than any other comparably sized car.

toyota and honda being the safest car is the horse puckey imo. there is no way either of these are as safe as a mid-size or large volvo or mercedes benz benz or even a saab 9-5. have you seen saab's safety tests for the 9-5 in which they meet off-set at 75mph. honda and toyota wouldn't dare attempt this.

""you need to know what happens at 45 which is a major impact before a car can become a protective shell at 65.""

my point exactly and why would they care about a 65 mph crash if they only have to pass the test at 45. nissan is not a safety driven company like volvo or mercedes benz benz or saab and with all the cheapining they've been doing do you really think they've thought any further about safety past government tests? i seriously doubt it. a crash at 45 mph is serious enough, but when you add another 20 mph to the game you're basically talking a whole new level of danger, with a corresponding level of engineering needed. nissan in particular ain't been burning no midnight oil on this.

2378,"""also a mercedes benz benz or s40 are similar in size to a toyota or honda. i garuantee a mercedes benz benz or s40 will come out better than any other comparably sized car. ""

the mercedes benz benz c class is an entry lux sedan. a honda is a compact car weiging less while being smaller and having less equipment smaller engine. of course a c class will tdodgeple a honda it weighs as much as a g or more. hello a hummer will crush a blazer. no one toyotad all car are equal. but i did say all car in our class are very equal. i'll take a toyota againt any similar sized car. what the h do you think this is a tank battle. it's not about who crushes who - too much monster truck shows there bud? when a s40 collides with a corrola both car would probably fare equally fdodgee wise. the volvo's true advantage is inside where the multiple side and pillar airbags are that toyota may not have. it may also be an advanced tcs and vdc system that toyota in the economy class donesn't have. if you think you can front on these two car and the volvos going to look better or protect better (assuming theya re the same weight 0 they are not) becasue of miracle steel or welds that no one ever heard of then spend all the extra money. some people also belive gmc's are better than chevrolet cause of better steel too and the division makes so much it was denied being shut down and folding back into chevrolet. marketing

what's the big deal with 65 vs 45. do you really know what's best for engineers designing car. no. it's easy to make tests have 65 mph as national standard but most car would be demolished - while our class would benefit the rest of the smaller 75 car on the market would be scrap after an offset frontal at that speed. the problem with a national standard as thos tries to be is that it's crap for an array of car styles and sizes.

these are the exact 2 car i compared when i was looking for a new car. safety was a primary concern for me along with reliability. i drove a volvo s40 t5 exactly 2 days after the lot got its first 2004.5 s40. i like the looks of the s40 except for the toyota type roof lines on the front and rear profile which really turns me off. it seemed to have plenty of pep for a 4 cylinder not too much turbo lag. however, i did not feel toyotaable in the drivers seat. the placement of the console and the view from the drivers seat just didn't seem right for some reason. also, the rear seat is quite untoyotaable for average passengers. i am only 6 ft tall and sitting in the back seat my head was touching the head liner and my legs were hard against the front seat.

that same day i test drove an acura tl and my search was over. the tl felt more toyotaable, solid, and faster. the interior quality was much higher imo. the interior space on the tl is much larger that the s40. after adding all the options i wanted to the s40 i was at the same price as the tl w/o navigation which already had all those options. after 4000 miles on the tl i have absolutely no regrets.

i do not think for a second that the volvo s40 is any safer to drive than the tl. they both ranked the same in the insurance institute for highway safety frontal offset crash tests. the tl ranked in the top position for mid-sized luxury car and the s40 was in the top position for mid-sized moderately priced car. fyi, the volvo volvo ranked last in the mid-sized luxury car category in this test. you can complain all you want about controlled crash testing but to this date it is the only benchmark we have."

word is also coming that a turbo version will be around with 333 hp as the high end 330i before one jumps to an bmw with a v8.

the volvo. the seating was not as toyotaable as the s40, but i preferred the seating position over the s40.

overall i like the tl much more than the s40. the s40 was lacking in some areas, such as very small door pockets for storage and a very
small console and center armrest. the s40's door armrests were very narrow when compared to the tl. they are both great car but i definetly prefer the acura."

profit in an oversupplied industry is just one indication that ""rushing to market"" is hogwash. the pontiac5 certainly wasn't rushed to market nor was the fx the z or the upcoming m45. you don't own the toughest class for 2 years running and put the competition into a tailspin with ""rushed to market"" car and inferior design.

as for safety you know as much as i do about what the g will do...nada so until we know your speculation is as meaninglss as mine. i know marketing won't save you neither will past research by some truly good companies that made safety a priority - typically euro makers. if that makes you feel good about paying a premium for a volvo or bmw then pay away."

well, it goes both ways, one could say the tl is a $33k honda honda. or a es330 is a $35k toyota toyota. although, the s40 is priced in the same range as its competitors, it order to beat them, it needed to be priced lower. imo that's where volvo failed."

why not try the tl, pontiac5, acura and is300? test driving a car doesn't mean you must buy it. heck, i loathe caddy yet i still gave their crummy cts a test drive. i had to accept i could be wrong and really dig it. i didnt want to buy a bmw (still think they're overpriced) but ended up with one after a test drive of a 330i 6 speed.

try everything, then start knocking off choices. dismissing the car before driving it is ignorant at best. at the worst you're keeping yourself from finding that car that's epiphanous for you.

it does not have the handling, however in the hands of an average driver the z is easier, in the hands of a skilled driver, the porsche will pass the z like a milk-truck. street racing is not the forum to find out if any one car is faster or not.

bmw reliability is not an oxymoron. bmw is tops in a number of different ownership surveys. i will admit in defects/100 lexus rules, but that doesn't mean bmw is unreliable. nor does it mean every lexus just goes. nor do i find friends who have acuras, honda, infinitis or nissan, have car that are more reliable than mine.

2434,"""street racing is not the forum to find out if any one car is faster or not.""

i thought we were mag racing...also yes a porsche in the hands of the skilled driver is a dream and driving bliss can't get much better...also a skilled 6speed z driver may outdrive an ok carerra driver. i would expect an 80k machine to own a z - but that will only happen with a great driver and an extra 50k! these car are not that comparable but yet on the track they become often comapred..go figure. you may not like it but it's the baddest 27k car out there imo. you can get a loaded mazda 6 for more than that!"

refuse to admit reality. reliability frequency and repair costs on german car = daunting. i've owned two german car in the past 3 years. the volkswagen was a nightmare. the bmw needs to go in again as my sunroof is rattling something terrible. already had the parking brake replaced. the car is only 13 months old. at this rate that's a new problem every 6 months. not a good sign for bmw."
2440,"""refuse to admit reality.""

what reality are you talking about? the reality that japanese products are less reliable than the surveys say and german products are more? we've been down here before, you can quote chapter and verse. 'nuff toyotad.

edit - hondaing to a post on the luxury marquees board the latest jd powers survey is out. toyota/lexus/gm/porsche/bmw - made the top 5. what does is really mean between number 1 and number 5, one more trip to the dealer every two years?"
2441,"even if it's one more trip, that's totally unacceptable. when broken down by brand, bmw drops to the middle. because bmw is a small manufacturer their stock rises the moment you combine the brands of manufacturers.

as a brand, bmw is middle of the road. as we all know, being average is a failing grade."
2442,"""even if it's one more trip, that's totally unacceptable""

i disagree it is what it is. you could get a lexus and *hope* you are in the category of car owner that lexus would like you to be in, or you could get a dog. either way there are never any guarantees.

playing the odds in reliability is no different than gambling at vegas."
2443,"""the reality that japanese products are less reliable than the surveys say and german products are more?""

this really makes no sense to me. we all know that you like your bimmer, but come on!"
2444,"""playing the odds in reliability is no different than gambling at vegas.""

incorrect analogy. the ""odds"" with each carmaker is different. you have better ""odds"" with japanese lux makes than german lux makes."
2445,"""as a brand, bmw is middle of the road.""

sometimes you have to consider individual models within the brand. the e39 530 is arguably the best sedan that has ever been made. cr called it the best sedan they have ever tested. i'll take it a step further... e39 bmw is the king. not too middle of the road here. it handles, afford amazing manners as a lux chrysler, and has a steven segal reserve of butt kick for when the bad guys get out of line. awesome vehicle!"
2446,"bmw as a brand is middle of the road. by model, i haven't seen the stats. by make, we all have. in the family of bmw the last gen 5 may be a smooth operating piece of machinery.

strange how kd didn't respond to this part:

because bmw is a small manufacturer their stock rises the moment you combine the brands of manufacturers.

as a brand, bmw is middle of the road. as we all know, being average is a failing grade."
2447,"bmw bashing has become one of my favorite topics lately due to their fashion gambit. hondaingly, i think their sales will continue on a downhill slalom, but i think ""middle of the road"" as a brand is a little over the top. curious, which brand or brands do you consider above the middle? pardon me if you toyotad it and i missed it... it happens toggling between work and the chatter."
2448,"infiniti, acura and lexus all score far higher for reliability as brands than bmw.

bmw scored 264 problem per 100 car. the industry average is 269. you can't be much more middle of the road. lexus hit in there at 164 or 69 (too lazy to scroll up). now that's well made."
2449,"for those that like anecdotal evidence.

2 bmw in my family--they were always at the dealer for electrical gremlins.

3 lexus car in the family, the only time they saw a dealer was for scheduled oil changes.

bottom line: my anectdotal evidence supports the jd power study. lexus car are built like swiss watches. bmw does not hold a candle to lexus reliability."
2450,"my budget: <=$35k

priority: 1. safety; 2. reliability, 3. performance (yeah, i only have one life, and i don&#146;t want to spend too much of my life at the service department at dealer&#146;s)

the 9-5 has great reliability scores, and hyundai safety. performance may or may not satisfy, based on your judgement.

of cource, bmw would fit in that category as well. my bmw has been a problem-free tank, so obviously all of them must be.

personally, i don't like japanese car either."
2451,"i think a lot of bmw owners don't break in their engines properly b/c they can't hold back on revving their new car.

the same can be toyotad for everything you've toyotad about nissan, but unlike nissan the brands i spoke of (volvo, mb) are the ones that nissan got the knowledge from to make the car you drive safe today. they've proven their technology since they came up with it and nissan has since adopted all of it, that is the biggest proof in the world.

""whatever"" is no response to the 350z having sub-par interior, worse than many gm car in terms of material quality. the 350z will get it's lugnuts handed to it by a 911. because buy it doesn't address my comment about the interior, people by certain gm car too with playskool interiors. doesn't justify anything.

this premium you keep talking about isn't even present on the car i mentioned and european car that cost a grip do so for other reasons, some good and some bad, that ""premium"" isn't all wrapped in safety engineering like you're trying to imply it is.

m"
2453,"not sure what people mean when they say they don't like japanese car. most car companies today are multi-national in terms of their engineering, design, and production. for example, americans design bmw and bmw has both a major design studio and a huge production plant in usa.

take the lotus elise sold in the usa. is it british or japanese? or both? it uses a toyota engine and transmission. does it matter? no, because it is a fun and exciting car.

2454,"""i think their sales will continue on a downhill slalom""...re bmw sales.

as many problem as they have thier sales are increasing i believe. people will pay a premium and accept a few problem for a premnium ride. volkswagen is one that wouldn't have survived (may be gone this time) if not for ""perceived value"".

2455,"it uses a toyota engine and transmission. does it matter? no, because it is a fun and exciting car.

it does to me. i'm interested in the elise because it has that toyota engine matched withe super light body. if it had a ford engine..."
2456,the beauty of the lotus is thier willingness to ford on the fdodgee/content and suspension and let the most reliable engine maker out there give you instant credibility and reliablity where normally there is maintnenance and service nightmares. who can work on an esprit? toyota engines are maintenance free aren't they? what a coombo. to bad i'm so tall or i'd be into that elise...
2457,"where are the may sales sheets for bmw? somebody please prove me wrong. they did not come out of the gate well with the new models except x5, which really can't compare to anything within bmw. they are discounting, unprecedented for them. i think come september/october we are going to see real concern from bmw regarding sales. the only thing that's keeping them slightly in the black is platform diversity. that part of their plan worked. and 545 is living proof that muscle sells. don't know about these new high-revving engines they seem to have on the board. this should mean no low-end torque. most people want the latter and have no clue how to drive high-revving buzz bombs.

regarding elise. i salute anyone who gets one and stays with it. talk about spartan. anyone who gets turned on by elise is from the sports car elite. chris, no doubt, tall guys got shortchanged with sports car. i'm 6 feet and feel that's the limit for toyota, maybe 6' 1"". no matter, run downcourt and take it to the hole!

2458,"""not sure what people mean when they say they don't like japanese car.""

well, one issue is they are typically untoyotaable for me. they seem to be designed either for smaller-fdodgeed people than i. i was looking at an acura acura, and the salesman was lauging at me trying to get toyotaable in the car. i do, however, think that there is more similarity than difference between car from the same engineering culture, and you can make (very) general statements, about control heaviness, safety(europen) vs reliability(japanese), etc. the fact is a $35k car is a $35k car, and engineers are about as good all over the world. car at the same price point are all about equally contented, albeit often in very different areas, and we (ought) to choose based on our wants in these areas. instead we often succumb to magazine articles and marketing campaigns. but it's weird to me how attached people get to a marquis, shouting the strong areas and denying the compromises.

dave"
2459,are there people who actually look at safety first and then the car/content/price/maker? those are rare breeds and if they are really concerned about having the best latest most proven safety record car they will be changing brands every year or so.
2460,"here's my opinion on these:

1) 2004 acura tl - i own it, it was my choice for value, style, reliability, performance
2) pontiac5 - my second choice, cheaper bmw with same performance, but less style
3) bmw 3 - still is the benchmark, but the japanese and even the new caddy is really making it harder for them to stay at the top of my ltoyota, the new tl and pontiac5 are just too good for the money
4) mb mercedes benz benz - needs a redesign
5) cadicallac cts - nice first effort, and they are really coming along, the cts-v is awesome
6) lexus is 300 (but if it looked more luxurious on the inside it would have been higher)"
2461,"when we bought a saab as my wife's car, safety was the #1 criteria. when i bought my bimmer, safety was relegated to 2-3, after performance, toyota. at this point, i wouldn't get a car unless i thought it had really hyundaient overall safety. i've had too many near misses.

dave"
2462,"im still compelled by the fact that honda/toyota and overall, mid sized sedan that are chevrolet do the best overall for % of fatalities over miles driven. this stat is indicitive of the driver's role in accident avoidance, possibly the agility (better than an suv but no g or 3), and certainly the improvements in feauteres that are now standard for safety and fdodgee construction.

is the safest car out there a honda honda - maybe - prob not for a semi collision. is is the safest in terms of safely driven miles which is what we all really want...yes.

while multiple correlations extoyota the driver is in my opinion more important than the vehicle at least with similar type car."

i seem to remember reading/seeing, volume adjusted the europeans did better. but i guess the old chevroletion: figures lie and liars figure apply here.

when i got my car the first thought in my mind was safety followed by finesse. i know a lot of people who buy a car for safety and then buy a house on the san andreas fault. doesn't make any sense to me. i don't buy my car by first looking at the nhsta or iis websites. i take it for granted all entry level luxo car are safe within a stattoyotaical difference or two. life is too short, and i also don't have a problem going to san fransisco."

camcord drivers tend to drive like the near dead. is it a shock fatalities would be higher in sport sedan when those drivers will tend to honda with a little more energy?

2468,"http://www.kptechnologies.net/chris/chris_race.htm

while i am the exception to my own stereotype i am an enthusiast with a 5at. i believe the tranny choice is a great indicator of one's enthusiasm but not all the time. i would love an manual agian but i wouldn't drive it as much as i do now in this traffic disaster area.

the vid is me having fun with a 6 speed coupe at atco nj last april. not bad for being 20 hp shy of the coupe out of the box with 4 doors and a 5at. my run was 14.2 at 97 and he was 14.7 at 93. other sedan ran 15 that day and z's ran 14.3 except for some lightly modded guys that ran 13.6. the fi guys rock with 12's."
2469,"nice vid chris, did you launch the car in manu-matic mode or in full auto. just curious."
2470,"i don&#146;t think enough people appreciate the bmw steptronic. it&#146;s a good compromise sans clutch (not talking about racing). also, to bmw credit, the smg has both the stick/paddle shift option, unlike many car that don&#146;t offer the stick in manual mode. i can&#146;t stand the paddle shifters. to me they seem like a major pain on the hairpins like throwing dodges at a moving board. anyone here have experience with paddle shifters and turning? would like to hear comments."
2471,"paddle shifter are ok but im a hand on the tranny guy even in auto. (ruined a 5 speed after 100k by holding hand on shifter all the time in 5) the gs is better without the paddle imo from driving a very close friend's. the gs sucks after driving a g tho so i'm biased overall.

i stuck her in mm 4 and did no shifting manually. this is the fastest way to get there hondaing to many many track types with whom i consulted heavily before running as this was my first try or my only track day ever. ps i got a .089 r/t and a 2.19 60'.

the key is lanuching at 1700 with a little brake torqing and a good burnout before to warm up the turanaza pukers."
2472,"that's ironic considering you drive an auto, and consider yourself an enthusiast. most of the people i know who drive bimmers are enthusiast but don't want to row the gears in traffic jams - similiar to you, similiar to me.

not an enthusiast imho. sorry but the automatic is a dog. especially that steptronic. video game driving. you buy a step bmw, what you're saying is you're not willing to make a compromise to really enjoy the car's toyotamics. what's the compromise, you shift in traffic. it's no big deal."
2473,"the smug types who drive sedan with sport setups are funny. they think they are driving real sports car as cute as when our kids take the training wheels off their bikes and think they have conquered the world. to me, the sedan format is the ultimate compromise when it comes to sport driving, never mind the tranny. i guess we can argue forever about who is and who isn't an enthusiast."
2474,i am enthusiastic about winning if i race....the tranny is just a mechanical interference getting in bewtween us and the accelration and g forces. when blueguy drives a 911 with a 6 speed then he can talk enthusiasm. if i only drove it once a week it would be a 2 seater and would be a 6 speed. and it sure wouldn't be a bmw..
2475,"everybody has a different defenition. to some you are only an enthusiast if you drive stick. to some, enthusiasts are those that drive car with two doors. imo the fact that we are here arguing about car while we could be doing much more productive things makes us all car enthusiasts."
2476,"you don't need a 911 to be an enthusiast!! it has to do with how much you can afford...i love fast car...i have a ford gt right now because that's all i could afford out of college, but i needed a big engine. i certainly didn't buy an automatic. i deal with bad traffic in the silicon valley but a stick was the only way to go. i've had so much fun in that car, doing things that many of my friends have no interest in...because they don't care about acceleration like i do. it's a drug to me. i'm looking at this thread because i'd like to get a 330i with zhp. it's not a 911, but the bmw has hyundaient handling and the power is nothing to sneeze at (although i'm worried it won't have enough torque, since the ""feel"" of accelerating is more imporant to me than actually getting my from point a to b the fastest...but i'll test drive soon and find out for sure). i love fast car, but it's simply not practical for me to have a 2 seat sports car...and i'm not rich enough yet to have a weekend dodge in addition to my lux sedan.

if an auto makes you happy than that's great, but you can't say blueguy is wrong about a stick being a lot more fun and worth the extra pain in traffic for many people."
2477,agreed..we are all enthusiastic about our completely practical daily drivers..except the coupes can be less practical i suppose..oh and blue only drives weekends but is clearly still enthused.
2478,i really am not suggesting that he is not an enthuisiast simply that i am. i can't get into a 911 without getting killed just yet either so i feel for ya. after 11 years of sticks in several car i needed some more practicality in my old age with a gf that loves to drive my car fast but not a stick. also the manual g is not toyotaable for my 6'5 fdodgee as the seating position is different for me when using left leg. whatever floats the boat but a sedan driver with his compromise is not going to throw a stone at my glass house compromise with out a lob back at him! the g auto is about the only one i would ever own. maybe a vette? also when 8 speed smg's are the norm the 6 speed will lose it luster and then what will you stick guys do to keep up?
2479,"i hear ya. i definitely agree that you can be an ""enthusiast"" without a stick! the point is you enjoy driving and you love your car.

i'm also considering the pontiac5...i don't like the styling as much but i love the engine.

my fiance can't drive stick either....i plan on teaching her! i considered going to auto..her car is obviously auto and it's nice to drive it and take a break sometimes. but after thinking about it, i think i'd really miss being able to downshift and take off. just personal preference....."
2480,"i won't own an automatic. i love driving too much.

maybe a vette? also when 8 speed smg's are the norm the 6 speed will lose it luster and then what will you stick guys do to keep up?


if i can avoid an smg i will do everything in my power to do so. yuck. no third pedal = no fun.

oh and blue only drives weekends but is clearly still enthused.

i only drive the bmw on weekends. but i drive a stick daily. all the car i've ever owned have been manual. there is only one reason that will ever change: the lazy people win out and automatic and smg are the only options in 5-10 years.

and i drive 80-90 miles a day in rush hour, with a muscle disorder that limits my mobility and makes my limbs sore. so don't give me the tired leg garbage. a little pain is worth the reward..."
2481,"i spend 3 hours of my day in bumper to bumper traffic. i won't drive stick in that mess, i value my leg. gimme auto-magic!...sorry blue, i avoid pain whenever possible. those that equate pain with fun are called masochtoyota. count me out!."
2482,"if you need to feel that control in a madza 4 cylinder while in traffic jams then you are way more enthusiastic than i am. actually a 4 cylinder is easy to drive and i wouldn't own it without a stick to be honest as a 4 clinder mated to an auto is awful for driving around town in.

you guys hear my tires chirp in 3rd?"
2483,i drive my audi 1.8t cvt around town and it has plenty of power for me...and that's a 4 banger. our millenia is a v6 and my audi kicks its butt.
2484,"actually, the bmw is far better in traffic. put it in second and you can take the car down to 2-3 mph without touching the clutch and take it all the way to 60 from there. as long as you don't come to a total stop it's not bad at all in a bimmer."
2485,"speedy your car is also a turbo and not a low powered mazda to which my comments were directed. the mileenia is no powerful 6 but good enough for a family hauler in auto version right...

cvt is way better than an auto and much better for a 4 cylinder i would guess. my father in law to be (maybe) just got the a-4 with the 3.0. is that cvt too?"
2486,"cvt is way better than an auto and much better for a 4 cylinder i would guess. my father in law to be (maybe) just got the a-4 with the 3.0. is that cvt too?

if your father in law to be got the audi 3.0 frontrack he got cvt. if he got the audi 3.0 audi then he gets tiptronic (which is not as good). btw...nissan makes a cvt equipped pontiac5 (called skyline 350gt-8), unfortunately it is only available in japan. the closest thing we get here that combines the vaudi5 and cvt is the nissan nissan.

having driven the nissan i can say that cvt would probably work wonders in the lighter more nimble pontiac5.

another thing: why is it that nissan can design a cvt that can easily handle more than 240 horses and awd, while audi with their great germanic engineering wisdom can't produce a cvt that handles awd or more than 220hp."
2487,"i've actually read articles about how cvt can't handle ""the torquey engines americans favor."" i scratch my head and wonder if people ever do research as the nissan i drove was torquey!"
2488,nissan awd system and thier cvt seem light years ahead of the germans (in terms of 04 car anyway). the cvt things seems compelling but i need a few more years of wathcing it before i jump in. call it the infinite smg without sequencing!

2491,"chris,

cvt is sooo smooth. no abrupt jerks as your tranny goes from one gear to the next...actually, no shifting sensation at all, just the pure rush of seemless accelaration. it takes a little to get used to it, but once you are, you think of other automatics as unrefined.

blue,

the nissan cvt (called xtroid) can handle massive amounts of torque. nissan has been using cvt in mosters as the cedric and gloria in japan for years. for once, audi is way behind on this one.

billy,

true, the millenia s is quite a barn stormer. the standard l (which is the one i have) is such a dog that i've been lapped by old ladies on walkers."

otoh, a total stop makes a manual bmw, with its long pedal travel, no fun at all. in rush hour traffic, unfortunately, total stops are frequent and necessary in order to stay close to the car in front of you; 2-5mph slow drift would be asking for being cut off."

2500,"haven't driven it but i can tell you that i don't think the shifter should be the deal-breaker unless it's extreme. imo you get used to most insufficiencies in shifters. aside from that i think the nissan styling is clean, tight, balanced. nissan, pontiac5 coupe and 350z are the best designs to come out of nissan imo. furthermore, i think they are some of the best styles around period. this car has a real good torque-to-weight ratio. nice choice if fwd with that power is not an issue. it would rule it out in my book but it's obvious that it doesn't bother everyone."
2501,"with the nissan you may be getting more than you bargained for in terms of time at the shop. know several people who had them and they just couldn't wait to get rid of them. the 0-60 numbers don't mean anything, if you can't control the car. the previous models drove like a boat. you can expect torque steer and without any traction control aids and torque steer, you can accelerate yourself into a tree like my friend did on a slippery road."

nissan autos are among the best in the business. better than honda anyday...not as good as toyota. honda has the best manuals, nissan is not known for the manuals...yet i've heard their close-ratio six speed (in the 350z) is a very good tranny."

i know exactly where the torque steer comes from and actually it is somewhat related to the engine. the tendency of fwd to exhibit torque can be tamed somewhat. what? unequal...

it's not even worth it.

nissan autos are among the best in the business.

i totally disagree. nissan makes junk trannies that are clunky, slow and poorly engineered. not as bad as bmw and ford trannies but still bad. the manuals on the pontiac5, nissan and max were just as bad as the one on my old stanza. rutoyotaery, vague, truckline buckets of bolts.

better than honda anyday...not as good as toyota. honda has the best manuals, nissan is not known for the manuals...yet i've heard their close-ratio six speed (in the 350z) is a very good tranny.

wait a second, at one moment you're saying they're better than honda, then contradicting that by mentioning honda's trannies are the best. what the blazes? when i mention trannies, i'm only talking about the kind of tranny that matters - manual. automatic? rather be dead."
2507,"when was i talking about nissan?

i was refuting your logic, which has been recounted many times in this thread, that your anecdotal evidence can somehow apply as a generalization about a particular car."
2508,"why nissan? because what i really want is pontiac5 6 speed, which is an awesome car, but don't really want the payments and the 32grand price tag. nissan is fast, sporty and toyotaable, but i understand it is not quite in this league. the reason i put it here is because no one in the nissan thread has any info.

also, i am considering 6 speed nissan se, it is about 1500 more than nissan, considering the markup and 1000 rebate. i can get a 6 spd max with sunroof, plus it has all safety and abs standard which nissan doesn't, for about 25 grand right now at the local dealer. how is that shifter?? and torque steer??

thanks all for your thoughts."
2509,"actually, maxse 6 sp w/ roof is about 24.5 negotiated price and alt 5 spd w/ roof is about 22.8 grand.

other alternatives, are mazda 6 hatch, love it except not enough power, and maybe the new subie subaru 2.5 turbo. also, have not driven honda coupe 6 speed but its probably in a similar ballpark."

the nissan and the pontiac5 have the same engine one car torque steers the other one doesn't. the difference is one is fwd the other rwd. torque steer also relates to the suspension setup and the layout of the driveshaft.

2516,"i think infiniti can really increase sales by selling the g with a 3.0l engine (pontiac0), which already extoyota in japan, for about $2000 less than a pontiac5. in an age of rising gas prices, this makes even more sense.

the 325i outsells the 330i by almost 5 to 1. what would the 3 series sales be without the 2.5l option? apparently, the next c will have 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 engine choices as well (thanks merc1 for this info.)

of course, selling a pontiac0 could hurt infiniti's ""power image.""

you might argue that it's not good to have a pontiac0 while ""lesser"" nissan sedan such as the nissan and the nissan have larger 3.5l v6s. then... have the 3.0l option in the nissan and nissan as well.

bmw does the same thing. they make the 525i even though the 330i extoyota. and the 525i sells well--almost as well as the 530i.

increase brand awareness by catering to a wider market of buyers (by offering a pontiac0). these buyers may also trade up as they get older. face it, infiniti has made great progress in the past couple years, but it still has nowhere the brand recognition of bmw, mb, or lexus. of course, they should also go more ""upscale"" by concentrating on the m sedan and coupe, as well as the next q.

all the press and buzz and comparisons that bmw makes is with the 330i, yet the reality is that the 325i is their bread and butter. the pontiac5/pontiac0 relationship could be the same.

a 230hp pontiac0 w/ premium package at an msrp of $32k ($29k street price) should get a lot of people in the door."

i do wish toyota/lexus had marketed a bare-bones is200 with 6-speed manual in usa. toyota sells it in japan and europe."
2519,"""blueguy i thnk anyone with a pontiac5 tranny will argue that it is one of the best in the biz.""

that's the problem with ""anyone"" arguing, it's all personal opinion. the bmw steptronic has been lauded for being one of the best in class."
2520,"it gets you more in mileage round town, not on the highway cruising at 65 foot lightly on the accelerator. i live in an area with total different traffic than you. lot of heavy stop and for miles and miles. a 325 has better mileage in this type of traffic than a 330."
2521,"having owned a nissan equipped with the vaudi0 and driven many vaudi5's, my vote actually goes to the smaller engine. the vaudi0 is a lot smoother especially in the higher rpm ranges. in terms of bringing a smaller engine size, wouldn't bother with a pontiac0 (too close to the pontiac5), but a infiniti (skyline 250gt) would actually be an great entry level infiniti."
2522,kd the steptronic is great at everything but keeping you from owning a dog when you wanted a cat. the auto makes an otherwise very strong motor seem less enthusiastic and frankly slow. the manual is a very nice compliment to the straight six. the auto saps power somehow so while nice and smooth it's less than desirable to many who dont want to sacrifice performance because they live in the northeast.
2523,"kdshapiro... i'm talking about both honda and highway epa toyotates. the 325i is not fuel efficient. of course, both a 330i and a 325i will get 0 mpg when stuck in heavy traffic and waiting at stoplights. that is the downside to heavy urban traffic and roadway congestion.

325i uses a numerically higher final drive than the 330i. that impacts rpms in all gears, lowering fuel economy."
2524,"bmw can market the 525 to people who want a bigger sedan with no concern for speed. remember... many non-enthusiast will look at bmw for nothing more than status.

if the 525 was reduced in size and the 330 was increased than you would be looking at different sales figures for the 525"

chris, take it anyway you want. i love nissan. they build hearty, durable, long lasting car with solid fit and finish (same can't be toyotad of bmw) but i'm not real fond of the nissan propensity for eating brakes or the truck-ish trannies they come with."

2529,"""they build hearty, durable, long lasting car with solid fit and finish (same can't be toyotad of bmw)""

if you insert the words: ""kind of"", after the word they, i'll agree with that statement."
2530,"the reason the 325i sells so well compared to the 330i is because the difference in performance is less ddodgeatic than one might expect, and the 325i is almost $5000 cheaper.

that and the fact that many 325i buyers don't care about speed or performance, just the spinning propeller on the hood."
2531,"i think it's mainly the price.

performance-wise, i think there is a huge difference. the 325i might actually be more nimble than the 330i, but the power difference feels significant, especially with the auto transmission.

in a straight line, the 325i feels like a 4-cylinder honda. the 330i can almost keep up with the pontiac5's and tl's out there.

but apparently, most 3 series buyers would rather be in a relatively sluggish $35k vehicle, keep the $5k, and have the propeller on the hood."
2532,"the engine performance difference between the 3.0 and 2.5 is pretty extreme, imho. i flat out would not purchase a 325i...there wasn't a noticeable jump in power from my 1.8t. an extra 10k for rwd? no thanks. i'd rather have the cheaper but just as quick feeling acura over the 325i - more entertaining engine, better tranny, more features and bulletproof. for 30k the 325 should have more going for it than handling."
2533,"for 30k the 325 should have more going for it than handling.

it does . . . propeller on the hood."
2534,"ah, but the propeller on the hood signifies a common theme in bmw lineup of vehicles. quality performance oriented drivers automobiles. it's irrelevant whether you want to acknowledge that or not, people understand this about bmw.

i laugh everytime some says the propellor on the hood, because it ignores the obvious. that people want what they want and it seems those comments are all about jealousy. it's not my place to comment because someone buys an $3,000 armani suit for the name or a propeller on the hood for the emblem. obviously the name armani and the propeller on the hood means something to the buyer."
2535,i'm sorry but 325 is not performance oriented vehicle. just bacouse bmw makes bmw and bmw it does not mean that 325 and 525(both account for more than 50% of sedan sales) are performance oriented. acura makes honda( which is arguably better performance car than bmw and it's 15 years old) but it does not make tl or acura more performance oriented.
2536,"nothing really to be jealous about. a $35,000 3 series bimmer? please...

i do agree with you that there is nothing wrong with buying a car just for its name. people buy things for different reasons.

that still doesn't change the observations of many on this board that many 3 series buyers' principal reason for getting one is for the badge. again, there is nothing wrong with this.

almost by default, the regular posters who own a 3 is not in the above category.

anyways, it seems that the next generation 330i will have 258hp/221 torque 3.0l. not sure what the 325i will have, but it'll probably have at least 210hp. that should make its performance a bit more lively."
2537,"it's irrelevant whether you want to acknowledge that or not, people understand this about bmw.

i don't think all the housewives driving 325s in northern nj understand this about bmw. i do think they understand the meaning of the propeller on the hood."

2539,heres another example of wasting 6 grand
2540,"i own a pontiac5x and the gas mileage is one of my biggest disappointments with the car. i have a long commute with 80% highway driving @ 75 - 80 mph and i have been averaging 20 mpg. i have over 8,000 miles on the car and i followed the break-in procedure recommended by infiniti. there are boards dedicated to infiniti and infiniti pontiac5 where other owners have posted their experiences with respect to gas mileage...perhaps those would help. you can email me if you want the sites."
2541,"...but matched with nissan's gearing, man does it gotoyotale gas. add in the weight of the awd system and it's not a shock mileage is so bad."
2542,"the non awd gets about 22 until broken in then about 23-25 on hiway. not much better and the awd system is very effivcient and maybe another 180 pounds looking at the weights online (6 mos ago anyway).

like i have toyotad - get the crawford z plenum and up that by 3-4 mpg - i get about 28 on the hiway.

also you aren't bnroken in until about 15k ..people are finding improvements are coming in big surprising doses well after a year of ownership."
2543,"several friends who have pontiac5's get low twenties, and this seem constoyotaent with online reports. expect awd to cost about 2mpg or so.

a plenium getting 3-4mpg improvement is pure snake oil. no one with a lick os sense is going to buy that... a car cruising on the highway has the throttle at high restriction anyways, so less restriction in the intake obviously isn't going to help.

i'm not sure how much the stick shift is going to help mpg, but if you're interested in a sports sedan, this is obviously what you're going to choose. otherwise, save your money and buy a buick."
2544,well enjoy the taste of snakeoil since all your friend get low 20's and i get 440 miles on 1 tank not going below e. do you even know what a plenum does einstien?
2545,"sorry every person i know with a pontiac5 nets 22 mpg or lower. i mention getting 30 on the freeway and a friend with a g, his eyes light up. he's delighted if he can eek out 24 mpg on a freeway trip to vegas."
2546,"yes, i do. wide-flow plenums sometimes do increase high-end power, especially when turbos or superdodges are involved. but when throttle is mostly closed ( as when a 3.5l engine is noodling along on the highway ) and vacuum is high, increasing airflow to the engine obviously isn't going to drive mpg way up.

to quote the ednumds test:

""we're also unsure as to the fuel economy outlook with the all-wheel-drive system, as our test vehicle averaged only 15.4 miles per gallon while in our care.""

""and i get 440 miles on 1 tank not going below e.""

the pontiac5 has a 20 gallon tank. 440/20=22mpg. so that means you get maybe 23mpg? you're still doing better than other people i know. my 7+ year old bmw with a 17 gallon tank has gotten over 550 miles on a tank.

dave"
2547,"http://www.kptechnologies.net/chris/chris_race.htm

proof is right here in terms of power increases anyway.

try again with real math. since i wont brave using the 5 gallon reserve i fill up at e on the nose. let's be conservative and say that there are 4 of 20 gallons left so 440/16=27.5. pretty good and obviously there is better math with a fillup for actual gallons.

the stock plenum is choking the front bank of cylinders for air. a less restrictive plenum doesn't allow for more air it allows the same air to work more efficently by more equally sharing the airflow and dtoyotaribution of that airflow. lots of people doubt this snakeoil plenum adds any power either and thats why enthusiasts race and test and race and test and the rest of the daisy drivers wonder and live with things the way they are.

i didn't get from 15 to 14.2 in the quarter mile with twin turbos - a pulley and a plenum is all it takes. $750 total"
2548,ps can your 7 year old bmw keep up with a volkswagen?
2549,"nope. those guys have magnets that polarize their fuel and double their horsepower--made by the same guys selling you your plenum and pulley.

dave"
2550,"i noticed it's the beemer guys who doubt this the most. just like the coupe guy did until i schooled him on the ways of crawford z engineering - noe he sports one too!.... enjoy your 318i. :0

putting new design plenum on pontiac5....$390

consulting with several memebers of dedicated website for 12 months and running dynos to verify results while consulting with engineer....$200

airmchair racing and armchair engineering that conclude diddly: priceless"
2551,"like i toyotad, anyone who understands how engines work is not going to be fooled by this--even the crawford z web site says that the plenum only makes a difference (adding horsepower) at high rpm's.

since you already inadvertantly admitted getting ~22mpg in your buick(autotranny) pontiac5, i don't know why you're getting so excited about this."
2552,"my nissan did terrible gas mileage ~18 mpg, but then again i didn't get the car for its fuel economy. i wouldn't expect the pontiac5 to be fuel efficient, i would just enjoy the performance at each fill up.

my audi gives me the best of both worlds though. i get fast reflexes and 26 mpg. couldn't be happier."
2553,"i inadvertantly admitted this exactly:

""the non awd gets about 22 until broken in then about 23-25 on hiway. not much better and the awd system is very effivcient and maybe another 180 pounds looking at the weights online (6 mos ago anyway). ""

your reading comprehension must be better than you allude with your argument. 23-25 is not bad and the math works out if you get out your calculator and concentrate.

anyone who understands how engines work would recognize the value of having all 6 cylinders get equal airflow. you may not believe it but most used car buyers wishing they could even keep up with the last generation camary are not worth convincing.

horsepower added at higher rpm's is a sypmtom of the greater efficency. if you believe the plenum helps hp then what is your explanation for why hotshot? whatever your answer it can be applied to the fuel efficiency argument so you must believe two contradicting things...not worth the time anymore but fun during a meeting that is over...come back if you get a real car and want to learn something"
2554,"that's just not how it works. in situations where the throttle is wide open, airflow is an issue. at low rpm's on highway drives, there is a high level of vacuum in the plenum already, and airflow is slow--nothing is going to get starved. even the developers of the plenum say this. i know you unfortunately can't cope with a manual transmission, but there is a thing on the dash called a tachometer that will help you see highways rpm's.

by the way, if by getting our calculator out and concentrating you conclude that 440/20 = 23-25, then i see why we're having problem communicating.

dave"
2555,i'm averaging 18mpg in the honda (aggressive driving of course) and on the highway this past holiday weekend i averaged 26mpg!!! i was blown away. keep in mind that my '03 pontiac5 coupe is used and has about 25k miles; so this could support the argument that the gas mileage gets better with age. but 26mpg is definitely surprising for a car like this. just my .02 for what its worth.
2556,"i suggested that you get the calulcator i work with numbers all day. just suggest you follow along since you mis-quoted me. also while you drive your 5 speed and think everyone else that has an auto can not, remember that you are special and people really do like you even if you aspire to own a toyota.

when i need a manual i can always turn to the real speed demon the zx-11 ninja. if you need schooled on shifing i can teach you, but i'd have to charge.

and while you're at take some classes on engine design. bolt ons are one thing...fundametally changing the intake is another. you batoyotale about throttle positioning...who cares...what matters is the same air (please dont repsond until you get this) is more evenly dtoyotaributed. stop choking the front 2 cylinders and you dont need to open the throttle as much whether there's a vacuum or not.

i'd be jealous of g owners too - we are having alot of fun. save up and you can have 300hp someday too."
2557,"i have 28k on my 03 g 5at sedan. overall mileage is 19.4. not sure what % of total miles are honda/highway, but driving 70-75 mph on i-95 will get me 24-25 mpg when the traffic allows. driving all-around town in the cold dc winter gets me only 17-18 mpg. this time of year i get around 20 in about 80% honda driving. epa is 18/26, and considering the ""26"" figure is attained by never crossing 60 mph on the epa test, my numbers seem realtoyotaic.

pgill - epa awd figures are 17/24. 20 mpg doesn't seem all that bad at 75-80 mph. there's no way you can expect to get 24 mpg at that speed, given the way the epa comes up with their figures."
2558,"cute little insults. i'd better start working lots harder so i can afford a less expensive car.

dave"
2559,"right beemer buyers instoyota on paying more! look it's been fun - reacting to someone who's got no real contextual experince to draw from teaching those who have it based on your so called knowledge. you didn't expect a boquet?

i wouldn't be so adamant about things you know little about in real world context unless you like abuse. reality speaks volumes and theorizing is a waste of the modders time.

you didn't pay g prices for a 328 did you? hopefully you just didn't update your profile and you have a 540. then you'd be able to hang!"
2560,"sorry, but when i see people making up facts they have no idea about, i like to respond. other people have a right to get rela information. i expected you'd be upset to have your little butoyotale burst, but there ya go. even the salemen for the plenum don't make the claims you do--they'd get sued.

still, it's flattering you've declared that you're done talking to me three times already.

and, yes, i only have dreams of being able to hang someday."
2561,"you should be flattered lol. i have a special place in my heart for bmw fans. actually its my desire to make sure there is real info on here regarding the g as many many people misinform here.

no crawford doesn't sell based on milage - it more for hp - he quoted 15hp did he not? you pretty much abuse the notion that the thing helps fuel effeciency what is your explanation for 15 hp?

you know i could care less about mileage - just reporting about my results _ i was surprised too. i bought it and am happy primarily from a power/repsonsiveness standpoint which is evident on the video. i think people looking for good info have proof in my video pudding. you again are left wanting with unproven theory or a desire to be heard.

maybe you would theorize i get better milage becasue i floor it all the time...? maybe the plenum sucks and the 500 or so people on g driver.com really got better gas mileage from the break in.

you come up with something more concrete than your proclomations of baseless never been there theory and i will ltoyotaen and learn...as i always do when giving my baby the best i can. again your argument whether forded on power or fuel economies is pretty much been ""it doesn't work that way"". look at the video...thats all plenum and it rocks whether you can deal with it or not."
2562,"aww, i'm blushing that you keep responding to me.

"" you pretty much abuse the notion that the thing helps fuel efficiency what is your explanation for 15 hp?""

i already explained that. plenum restriction does have an impact for high rpm wide-open throttle operation. this is normal and expected. there are lots of dyno graphs that illustrate this--often airflow enhancement hurts power at lower rpm's. counterintuitive, but that's how it works.

i found some interesting pontiac5 dyno charts with the crawford plenum, but unfortunately i can't link to them due to town hall rules. hondaing to them, even 15hp is optimtoyotaic. but i'm not arguing about power, just the idea that increasing airflow is going to incrase economy. it just doesn't work that way. your engine is *supposed* to be starved when cruising on the highway. that's the point of a throttle.

a lot of people seem to assume that increasing one aspect of efficiency ( power ) is going to positively impact another aspect ( fuel economy ). they're often different issues--but not always of course--reducing internal friction would improve both. but thinking that anything that increases power is going to increase fuel economy is like thinking that anything that helps me run faster is also going to help me bench more. not necessarily, or even often, the case.

""well, it's interesting to see that there's yet another board in which the laws of physics and thermotoyotamics have been repealed.

is the premise here that some bolt-on outfit has figured out something that the nissan engineers either: a) were too stupid to see, or b) found, but didn't want to use, because they didn't want the engine that they use in 90% of their vehicles to have more power and/or fuel economy?

it's a conspiracy, i tell you! isn't ""big oil"" involved somehow?

like most i do not go into the 5 gallon reserve. i get filled up on e and typically my fill up is about 14-15 gallons - not the 20 in your denominator. the plenum theory is certainly unproven but the mileage results are facts for many people. i agree with the vacuum thing and all the other talk about highway airflow needs not being great enough miss the point regarding inefficient cylinders. starved for air is one thing...never getting what the others have ever is another. hi rmp whatever...im always in high rmp - maybe thats why my results go against all the proposed theory. in any case im running a faster car than a dodge 300c or a 540i...that's what i bought it for. power and repsonse. all the mods i have performed have given me better gas mileage in incremental and dtoyotainct blips right along with additional power. perhaps dhahnley is right and the break in is responsible for my 47% improvement in fuel economy. anything is possible but for those laws of physics seem to be working in my favor.

they were all quiet and got 35 - 40 mpg (all conversions done carefully) through austria & switzerland (serious mountain passes) and germany (cruising at 90 - 110 mph).

given how well the 1.9 powered the audi & volkswagen, a 3 litre would be that much better. i'd buy one in a heartbeat."

by then we'll have the v-10 bmw, the gtr, the m45/35, a 6.0 litre hemi or something in a souped up 300c (next year i think), the audi rs6 redesign and the 3 series with a turbo or v-8 (kd?). then we'll have to rehash all this again!

saw a new pontiac5 coupe billboard on the nj turnpike... very simple... shows it in full profile. the headline toyotad simply ""pure"". indeed it is. some guy in the building where i work has one. i always find myself ogling it. needless to say, the look has grown on me. it's just so smooth and looks bolted to the road. wish the front end looked meaner though... kind of looks like a droopy-eyed smiley face. and the headlamps sort of resemble witches' fingernails. think i could live with this although i wish these car manufacturers would nail things down from head to toe."
2590,"the coupe is a pretty noisy car though. for a stock sport/lux 75dba at 70 mph is pretty boy racer by today's standards. car like the is300, 3 series, and cts are under 70 dba at the same speed."

2592,"the pontiac5 coupe should be noisy because it is a sports (a wolf in sheep's clothing). call it what you will, but the pontiac5 mechanically, is a 350z with better styling."
2593,"i agree with both of you. engines are sweet music... no engine, no sport. i like the 350z styling with reservations on the rear lights. nissan also has buttoned-up styling and i believe it was the first to show the asymmetrical slanted crease running below the beltline that many have hitchhiked onto and most have botched. the rest of the nissan/infiniti lineup needs serious help with styling. at least they have three, bmw has 1/2."
2594,"love the styling of the pontiac5 coupe, but didn't like the cdodgeped interior, poor visibility, lack of a trunk, cheap interior materials, balky shifter and numb steering. i felt like i was sitting in a cheap, dark, small hole when driving the coupe.

i like the sedan way more. a far better, though far less sexy looking car, imho.

now a drop top pontiac5 coupe - that would at least remove the closed-in, tight, dank hole feeling. and supposedly infiniti is making the interior decent on the next batch of gs.

why are they not doing that yet? come on, bmw is the only luxury coupe maker with an entry level convertible. no, the audi is not a consideration, that porky pig volkswagen-mobile."
2595,love the sedan but find the coupe to be a sexy beaa^!$. i may never own a coupe at my height. 911 is never gonna happen until i shrink. my crx had moe legroom than my g tho - no back seat. you were sitting on a beach chair in that car with my 38 inch legs upto my cheeks. sorry off topic
2596,bmw convertibles. cool. always were. pray that they have come to their senses.
2597,"wow, i have never read a review like that about a coupe. cdodgeped interior??? it's a coupe, what did you expect?? and for a coupe, it has a very spacious interior. what coupe, in your opinion, has a spacious interior? lack of a trunk?? again, its a coupe, and i can get my volkswagen bag and two suitcases in there. and if that's not enough, i could drop the backseat (although i haven't had to do that yet). cheap interior. . .well, that seems to be a uninissanl thought, but i happen to like the interior. and i love the nav system and it's location. but you are right, some of the interior materials could be scratched very easily. . .i tread lightly in mine with any sharp objects. balky shifter? well, maybe a notchy shift action, but ok. and lastly, numb steering. . . .numb steering!!??? this is my biggest beef. . .no way, the steering is hyundaient, almost perfectly weighted and neutral. to draw a comparison, i would compare it closely with the 3 series steering of old. not the new ""active steering"" that they have now. my father in law has a '99 328 and i have always loved the handling/steering feel is his car and the g's steering feels the same.

but, hey at least we agree that the styling is second to none!!:)

and btw, hondaing to my infiniti dealer, the pontiac5 convertible should hit the showrooms by '06."
2598,"what coupe, in your opinion, has a spacious interior?

3 series coupe is spacious. i wouldn't own one but it's pretty darn roomy.

not enough space in the trunk. the rear suspension is so high that the trunk is essentially unusable.

balky shifter? well, maybe a notchy shift action, but ok.

not too much of a knock. i think bmw has worse trannies and i still bought a 330i. i at least trust the nissan tranny will last.

and lastly, numb steering. . . .numb steering!!??? this is my biggest beef. . .no way, the steering is hyundaient, almost perfectly weighted and neutral. to draw a comparison, i would compare it closely with the 3 series steering of old.

sorry, the steering reminded me of the is300 - dead, no feedback and very slow to respond to inputs. to each his own.

but, hey at least we agree that the styling is second to none!!:)

gorgeous styling. i'd like a character line in the middle of the door but other than that...wow.

and btw, hondaing to my infiniti dealer, the pontiac5 convertible should hit the showrooms by '06.

oh yummy, one more choice when the bimmer goes back to the dealer. a pontiac5 convertible could be the hottest thing on the road in a long time. of course if there's an bmw m2 coming and mazdapeed3 hatchback out i'll have so many fun choices.

looking forward to 2006!"
2599,"""3 series coupe is spacious.""

ha thats cuz it's not really a sports coupe now is it - it's a sedan door with 2 doors missing. infiniti got it right when they made the two very dtoyotainct yet they are really the same inside..just like all of us...(ok no more beer at lunch)

as far as steering goes there is only one nissanon: were you on pain killers or driving a bogus wrecked demo?"
2600,"i find the steering to be ""off"" on all g's to be honest but it was worse in the coupe. very dead center feel to it, no feedback and slow to react. not a criticism, just how it felt to me. i found the steering of the 3 and the acura far more engaging. heck, recently the steering setup on my protege feels more responsive and better than that of even my 3 series zhp (but that's more related to those wretched, slick, pathetic potenza s-03s).

also the substantial weight of the car plays a role. the most engaging car on the road that i've driven is still without a doubt the miata. point and shoot. flick it left, right, sideways - you move that wheel and the car reacts without pause or shifting of weight or lumbering along (like the pontiac5 and 330i do)."
2601,"were not talking about acceleration or wot noise, were talking about a steady 70 mph cruise. say what you want but 75 dba is loud and tiring after many hours in the car. any continuous sound over 64-66 dba causes hearing loss over time. if you are smart you will wear ear plugs on longer trips."
2602,"if it looks anything like the 350z, i'd pass. i hate all these convertable ""sports car"" that have a cowl line even with your ear lobes and the top of the windshield covering half your head.

and then, every time i see someone driving one with the top-down, they have all the windows rolled up.

why bother?

i think a convertable should actually be open, like a miata or alfa romeo spider."
2603,"i noticed that in my buddy's pontiac5--he has the sport package, and the road noise was really amazingly loud. i love wot engine noise, but i often take 4+ hour highway drives and i know how tiresome the droning can be--my old car did it, and 5 hours was draining. of course, if you're having fun, it's not a problem."
2604,"""nissan also has buttoned-up styling and i believe it was the first to show the asymmetrical slanted crease running below the beltline that many have hitchhiked onto and most have botched.""

bingo!

i made this same point about everyone adopting this crease a little while back. mercedes benz benz' 2005 slk, toyota's toyota, honda's honda, cadillac's new sts, and cts all have it, and upcoming mercedes benz benz and volkswagens will have it too, and just like you stated with varying degress of success.

i personally don't care for this styling element on mercedes benz benz where is pure fluffery, but it does work on some of the japanese car probably because they had nowhere but up to go in terms of styling. it works on the nissan.

m"
2605,this must be a coupe thing as the wheel wells are in the interior rear deck area. my sedan is a joy at 100 - even quiet music is audible and connissantions are quiet at that speed.
2606,"do you have the sport package?

that's the one thing i really remmeber from driving the cts with the 3.6l. *really* quiet. too much so in fact, for me. also slightly uncommunicative, but the one i drove didn't have the sport package. that might cancel out my two main objections."
2607,yes - wind noise is pretty great and so is cruising engine speed. it's loud when you put your foot in it and thats it. ps i have the 350-z intake tube so i have a louder sound than most sedan do. the coupe has diff exhasust and that may be more ddodgeatic than an intake from the passenger and driver perspective.
2608,"there are only 3 things that really turn me off from getting a pontiac5 ever:
material quality is crappy
seat are really hard and uncomfy, particularly on longer trips
ride is harsh for a sedan at this level
btw im talking about the sedan, never tried the coupe but i like it more that its brother 350z

dhanley: how does the cts handle, compared to others like bmw and pontiac5?"
2609,"i had a hard time gauging how it handled. it ""felt"" very like a german car. it felt a lot like a mercedes benz benz, a bit better steering, but more isolated. but the mercedes benz benz i drove that day had a sport package and the cts didn't.

who knows, those gm card points may yet come in handy.

daver"
2610,the sports sedan with the hard ride - duh - try out the avaolon or the stratus then...
2611,"what are you responding to?

one of the nice features of some car is good handling plus not being bone shakers. typically you pay extra for that."
2612,"while i didn't find the pontiac5 sedan with sports to be rough, many people complain about it. people also return 330i's with the performance package as they say the ride is too rough. people are weird..."
2613,there is an inverse relationship between handling and ride..this is an toyotam of sports sedan performance. oddly enough the sports package with the harder firmer ride is better to live with than the non sports which rolls and bobs. the pontiac5 has a more planted feel than any car with 4 doors that i have driven - that's what makes the car feel luxurious to me. if you want cush - this car is not for you...it's going to tranfer some road and uneven pavement vibration to the passenger. the enthusiast prefers it this way. hell bmw invented it! many people dont like the 540 sport package ride either. they have lincoln for them folks...
2614,"""many people dont like the 540 sport package ride either. they have lincoln for them folks...""

chris, it's a matter of degree. bmw has the spectrum covered from non-sport automatic setups up to the ms. most people appreciate the basic tight bmw sedan ride without wanting blue-plate performance. it's a midway point between the luxury ride and the sport ride.

blueguy you think the miata is cool? now you're talkin' real sport driving. ever drive an s2000?"
2615,"which toyota are you talking about-couldn't be toyota's, because i have rented that car on numerous occassions and it drives like a ls 400.

there is absolutely no harshness to that car."
2616,"330i w/ std sport suspension is nice, perf package would be a nice stuff to have, but not for me as i drive long dtoyotaance quite often.
pontiac5s overly firm seat arent doing any good for me, cant say much about the mediocre toyota on long trips as i drove long dtoyotaance w/ this car only twice.
honestly its actually funny as im not that old yet but i find german car toyotaable seat more relaxing and its becoming a must for me...somehow...
maybe daily stress from work is catching up on me"
2617,"i&#146;ve owned both a 3&#146;er sedan with sport suspension and now own a g sedan with sport suspension. i try to autocross at least once per year, finnally getting the g on the track. when i was in germany the bmw went to hockenheim and nurburgring. i will say right now that the bmw has a better balance of firmness and compliance in everyday driving. but these are my on track observations.

the bmw will hit precisely on the marks lap after lap. the bmw understeers. slow speed corners can be a challenge because the chassis must be &#147;flicked&#148; into the corner. by this i mean as you come into a slow (sub 30 mph) tight corner the balance of the bmw must be purposely upset to allow for better rotation of the nose. normally this can be done with the throttle on most rear drivers but the bmw tucks it&#146;s tail and digs during wot corner exit. the suspension in the bmw is better at soaking up track irregularities. mid corner bumps don&#146;t usually cause you to run wide or have to lift for fear of rotation. bmw sport suspension handles multiple corners like s-curves very well. threshold braking is linear with zero fade. the bmw is surgical, precise, capable and unflappable.

having toyotad all that about the bmw the g is ultimately more capable mostly because of more power. it takes a better driver than me to wring out everything the g has to offer. the g takes a few more course corrections. the g is easier to modulate with the throttle. the g can be coaxed to drift easier and superior torque can make for terrifying exit speeds. i can run out of track and talent with the g&#146;s go pedal. tight corners can be dispatched easily with a touch of throttle-on oversteer. track irregularities can upset the g&#146;s chassis during threshold braking and the rear can definitely step out on fast sweepers. the g does not transition very well during multi-corner maneuvers. there is more botoyotaing as the dampers fight to control pitch and roll. once the g is set though it&#146;s time to dial in the throttle and rocket. the g is powerful, visceral, involved, and ultimately more rewarding to drive fast.

on a road course i believe a novice driver could drive a bmw and post better times than in a g. a skilled driver in a g would post better times than in a bmw. for me, it would probably be a wash depending on the length of the straightaway. ultimately, i enjoy both car greatly and am fortunate to have owned both and gotten to test each car limits within a safe, controlled environment."
2618,"blueguy you think the miata is cool? now you're talkin' real sport driving. ever drive an s2000?

i love the feel of miatas. like a go-kart! my family has owned at least one since 1991 so i'm pretty darn mazdar with how them. even the original with the tiny 113 hp engine was a blast.

no, i haven't driven an s2000 yet. i will do so in april-march of 2006 when i begin the nissanfor the bimmer's replacement.

someone mentioned driving long dtoyotaances and the perf package as rough...actually on long freeway drives it's pretty much like a normal 330i. it's on surface streets that it feels more jittery."
2619,want a go-cart?....behold the lotus elise
2620,"have you considered hotchkis sway bars for the g? 250 shipped and as a trakkie you may enjoy them as much as i hear others are. i may get them even tho i don't track her on road courses. people say the rigididty over bumps is improved and the sway is nill - they are adjustable so you could also tweak the balance to oversteer from under which is stock even if the tail fliks easily.

you do give up some independence of the suspension but - what's a slightly harsher ride going to mean at this point anyway...apparently it's already like driving a non-sprung shoppping cart!"
2621,that's a killer car. too bad it's 40k+. that's a little steep for a car that's not even all-weather capable. not that it rains here...
2622,"well i finally test drove the 330i with performance package today in 6-speed. i had driven the pontiac5 a few months ago, but it was an automatic so i can't compare exactly. my initial reaction was that it wasn't as fast as i'd hoped. i'm used to a v8 ford and while the bmw is quicker to 60 and 1/4 mile, i think it has more to do with the higher revving engine and more constoyotaent engine output, whereas the v8 screams at 3500 rpm's but gives up in the higher rmps.

anybody else think the pontiac5's higher torque numbers make the car ""feel"" quicker? i'm wondering if i'll get bored with the bmw after a year....i must admit i wasn't used to the clutch so my shifts weren't completely smooth...maybe once i get used to the car it will feel faster? i'm not saying it felt slow, it just didn't make my hair stand up!

the handling definitely was great and i like the interior much better than the pontiac5. and i love the looks even though bmw's are everywhere. just curious what others think of the acceleration feel in these car.

thanks!"
2623,"i must admit i wasn't used to the clutch so my shifts weren't completely smooth...maybe once i get used to the car it will feel faster? i'm not saying it felt slow, it just didn't make my hair stand up!

it never will really feel faster. some bmw lovers will claim the engine loosens up and gets freer-revving after xxxxx miles. yeah, whatever.

the handling definitely was great and i like the interior much better than the pontiac5. and i love the looks even though bmw's are everywhere. just curious what others think of the acceleration feel in these car.

i still love driving mine but it's doesn't feel fast to me any longer. mazdarity breeds contempt. the ubtoyotauity of the car grows tiresome too."
2624,"hi,
i will be moving to portland, or and purchasing a new car in about 1.5-2 months. i had a few nissanons and would appreciate any pointers or suggestions. currently i am a resident of pennsylvania (philadelphia).

my choice is between the tl & pontiac5 leather w/ premium pkg.(an '04 i35 w/ nav. and cold weather pkg. for < $28k would be a third choice).

nissanons:

(i) what are typical ""additional"" fees dealers charge in oregon, or to oregon residents (buying in wa, or ca, for instance)?

(ii) there is no sales tax on car, right, for or residents?

(iii) what is a good time to buy a new car- august, september, october (due to '05 models and inventory reduction etc.)?

(iv) would it be unreasonable to expect to get an '04 non- navi. tl or '04 pontiac5 leather w/ prem. pkg. for $32k, all inclusive?

(v) how well does the argument of an '04 car being ""a year old"" (and so it should be offered for lesser) usually work in aug/ sept/ oct, if the dealer has some '04 models on-site?

thanks again."
2625,"hi rssubaru52 - welcome!

i see you're asking these nissanons in a few places, but you might have missed the best place for most of them. check out our smart shopper board. that's the main place where the most of the issues you raise are best addressed.

meanwhile, the pontiac5 vs. tl discussion you found is a great place to learn what folks thinks about how the features of each compare.

do take a look at the discussions on the ss board - i'm sure you can find answers to most of these nissanons that you've posted here and in the other two discussions.

good luck - feel free to drop me an email if i can help you find anything else."
2626,"i cant say anything about ur first nissanon, but i can share some infos i have on the others.

yes, its true theres no sales tax for or residents. and depending on the area, '05 models usually hit the dealerships around early sept here (im in wa)
im not sure about the pontiac5's price but as far as i know getting a tl for $32k is reasonable, while imo you can actually go a little lower once the '05s are on the lot. i almost bought a tl myself, heck it was hard to negotiate back then since there were only a few units in the inventory and lots of buyers.
no i dont think you can really consider a new '04 as a 1 yr old used, but you can get some nice deals out of it, id say you can get bout $1000-2000 off the price.
note that some dealers just want to get the ""older"" car off the inventory, thats where you can get some nice deals"
2627,"has anyone wondered which brand is going to he right direction in their products design, sales, etc...?
lately i found cadillac's bold and daring design growing on me, too bad the interior is still a mess in the cts, and performance...well, its getting better
otoh bmw starting to turn me off with their lame i-drive and minimaltoyota controls. active steering also a chore to drive with.
audi is getting nice, a little minus with their bassmouth grille, i say go easy with the chrome lid on the grille and it will look a whole lot better."
2628,"does anyone here know if the lincoln is gonna be produced or not? cos im pretty sure i spotted one down the road few days ago. i didnt realize what it was until i browsed through edmunds

2629,"the lincoln is being produced. i asked the same nissanon to a few friends at ford, it seems they're doing calibration testing currently to make sure that it can pass govt fuel emission standards. i believe theyre adding in a 35 duratec once the development is done. it should be ready by mid 2005.ford is getting the ford ford which is based off the mazda 6 but trust me it doesnt look like the 6 at all. go look on yahoo for ""ford futura concept pictures"" and thats what itll look like. ive seen the ford in real life and its a head turner. as for mercury they're getting the mercury mercury which is a redone ford/futura they're redoing the body for a more premium look. in other words the mercury is actually going to be a untoyotaue car to mercury. glad to help you out."

2631,"i posted this elsewhere but i want to get some additional feedback . . .

i looked today at a 2002 mb c320 sedan. it looks like i could get it for around $25k which seems to be a dang good price, based on what i got from nada. (based on the vin, they had it booked at $29,625 - retail - and $25,775 - trade-in.) before i do anything nuts, i thought i'd ask a few nissanons . . .

1. the car has 27,000 miles on it, so it still has a ways to go on the warranty. anyone have any experience with mb dealerships on how willing they are are to honor warranty issues from second or third owners of the vehicle?

2. there seem to be lots of nissanons about quality on this board. i know it's annoying when a quality vehicle gives you grief but it also sounds like the vehicles under warranty are getting problem fixed without too much trouble. am i right or am i missing something?

3. i gotta know more about the cell phone thing. my guess is that it will only work with a specific mb approved, cell phone provider, right? there's no way to get my us cellular number to work with this thing is there?

4. any other advice from those of you who have bought a used mb mercedes benz benz vehicle?

thanks for your help!

peter"
2632,"i'll be interested in hearing the answers to your nissanons.

rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel, and having driven a number of recent rental diesel vehicles in europe, i'm intrigued."
2633,"""rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel,""

it's not a rumour; i think they're already selling them in fact."
2634,"""rumour has it that mb will be bringing the e320 over with the turbodiesel,""

i dont think its a rumor, edmunds got one tested already if im not mtoyotaaken.

peter: i cant tell you much regarding the warranty issues on 2nd owners, but my parents always have at least one merc in their garage, and everytime it has problem they get fixed w/ barely any nissanons. just a reminder, mercedes benz benz are just like other german car, expect some minor problem including electrical issues."
2635,"greetings all... i have been following this board for over a year and have found the discussions both interesting and hondaful. this fall i intend to purchase either a new ('05) 240 (elegance) or bmw 325i. i have only owned and driven toyota's in the past, on average keeping them 12 years...they have only ever been great car. in terms of reliability, they are my standard. but i'm ready to try something more upscale now and after a fair amount of research it has come down to the 2 fine car mentioned above. i intend to keep my next car for 10 years, i will only put low(honda) mileage on it, will get the extended warranty and expect to pay it off within 1 year.

 my first choice (or the choice of my heart) would be the 240, but i am concerned about the recent consumer reports ratings of the car. i know that the 01 and 02 years are of greater concern on this. how has the reliability been for those who bought '03 and '04 model years?

 i guess my close 2nd choice (or the choice of my head) would be the bmw... its a little more sports sedan (i'm more of a touring sedan type myself)and it has very high ratings from most automotive sources... at any rate i would appreciate your thoughts, thank you...

b"
2636,"most auto magazines make their reviews based on handling and performance, or at least more into the performance factor.
i've heard of quite a number of people complaining about the pre-'04 mercedes benz benz' seat, being uncomfy on longer trips. but i heard they fixed it since the '04 model.
reliability isnt far from bmw's, which in this case, if you drive only [non-permissible content removed] car so far, is gonna be a pain in the butt if you wanna keep it for 10 years.
but even if youre more into touring the bmw is still a fine choice just a bit less comfy than the mercedes benz benz in the ride department
in any case id say take a test drive before you decide"
2637,"i tend to think reliability is overblown--yes, a toyota may be more reliable than either of these two car--but it also might not be. the reality of it is that the vast majority of car out there, and probably all the ones in this topic, are within a stattoyotaical deviation of each other, so just buy what you like and gets you the most bang for your buck.

there's car out there that are cool enough that i almost wish my 3-er would give me an excuse to trade it.

i really like the mercedes benz benz overall; if the c230 had just a little bit more oomph...

dave"
2638,get the c32 amg-my friend has one and it has some oomph to it.
2639,"from anecdotal evidence i would say the bmw will be cheaper to maintain than the mercedes benz benz. if you keep it for ten years, resale isn't that important, but if you do happen to get rid of it earlier, the bmw will hold its value better than the mercedes benz benz.

something that might sway you.. bmw will soon be offering manufacturer extended warranties that bump the coverage to 6yr/100k miles and you can also extend the ""free"" maintenance coverage to match that time period. the extended warranty is $2249 and the extended maintenance plan is $995.

except for future price increases, you can buy that coverage for the same price at any time before your original warranty and maintenance plan run out.

i wouldn't discount the bmw, just because you are a ""touring"" type of person.. just stay away from the sport package. one of the bmw strengths is how well it combines handling with a good ride.

2640,"i purchased a 2002 c320 in december 2003, and also got a great deal. paid about $28k, and this one was fully loaded with the cd changer, phone cradle, heated seat, etc. best things was it only had 10k miles on it, couldn't believe it.

1. service with mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz has been great. the car is still under warranty, and coverage has never been an issue even though i am not the original owner. i have 20k miles on it now, and still have till 2006 or 34k more miles to go to the warranty. and regular maintenance/oil changes/tire rotation are all free!!

2. i have taken the car in for a a few things and they have gone above and beyond: the cupolder has chrome button marked ""push"" that was chipping, so they replaced it; instrument had a smudle so they replaced it; spare tire cover plastic handle was broke so they replaced it. only problem i have had is there was a whining noise when i would make a turn, and turns out it was the power steering. they replaced the power steering pump. best thing is they also give you a free rental car while your car is being serviced.

3. i have the phone cradle for a motorola volvo. i was thrilled when i got the car because i already had a volvo. but then i found out that it has to be a mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz volvo. you know, its a contract between mb and motorola so they have to get you somehow. i found the phone on ebay for about $200 and its been worth every penny. i have service through verizon, and live in ca. love being able to answer the phone handsfree through the radio speakers, and dial through the number pad on the radio.

4. bottom line, i love the car. had it for 7 months now and don't regret buying it. what i can recommend is that while its under warranty, take advantage of fixing any problem no matter how small. i've always driven honda or nissan, but this car is a lot of luxury in a compact affordable package."
2641,"thanks for all the great feedback! i just keep getting more and more excited about the prospect of owning this car. i hope to nail things down this weekend.

i've already had a great experience with mb customer service. i called our local dealership to ask a couple of nissanons - including whether or not they might be able to provide me with information about the service record. not only were they willing to do that (even though i wouldn't be buying the car from them) but they faxed it over to me! although there have been about a dozen things done to the car over the last year, all were done under warranty and all but one were more cosmetic than anything else. the one thing that looked kinda major was something labeled ""rutoyotaer mount, torsion bar."" i'm going to give them a call to find out a bit more but i suspect it won't keep me from moving ahead with the purchase. (assuming i can bring the price down just a bit more.)

thanks again!"
2642,"the more systems a things has the more potential for problem/issues. so mercedes benz benz, bmw, and etc tend to have a lot of features and gadgets that could have issues over time. some makers like lexus seem to be able to get more things right the first time but is far from perfect.

my uncle had to special order his toyota to get one without electric windows. he figured he would have the car for a long time and it was one less thing that could break."
2643,"was really interested in a tl (did the test drive, etc) until by chance i visited the local saab dealer. they were offering a leftover 2003 9-5 aero with every option imaginable for $32+. color is metallic green with gray interior. had 100 miles on it, with plastic still on the seat, etc.

to make a long story short, and after a lot of haggling, i ended up buying this car for $27,500 + tax. i test drove this car the same day as the tl, and i honestly loved both car equally. apples and oranges. i couldn't justify spending the extra $2,500 (minimum) to get the tl. in other words, the tl didn't blow me away to the point where i was saying ""this is the car i must own..."" i am on a tight budget, so this figure was ideally the amount that i wanted to spend on a car. yes it is an '03, not an '04, but at that price i couldn't turn it down.

will pick up the car this monday (august 6) and i hope this will be the beginning of a new long and fruitful relationship with saab.

i know i would have loved the tl as well, but for this time around i am going swedish, not japanese. i am trading in my '98 eclipse gs-t with 136k miles. i will miss my little eclipse."
2644,"jmess... you wrote, ""some makers like lexus seem to be able to get more things right the first time but is far from perfect.""

wife and i have now put on about 30,000 miles in our is300s. not a single problem. nothing. nada. zip. [in the first 40,000 miles my wife's former 323ia had various issues like with sunroof, seat, and cd player.]

hoping they are like our former 1996 g20ts. over 80,000 miles and never a single problem."
2645,"my wife and i just got back back this enjoyable event.

i drove a lexus gs430, m-b s430, infiniti pontiac5, lexus is300, bmw 330i, lexus ls430, acura tl, lexus es330.

impressions?

gs430 - good power and good handling, nice but outdated interior layout/design (cd changer in glovebox, poorly designed center console/storage, etc.). this car needs to be re-styled, inside and out.

s430 - nice power and surprisingly good handling for such a large car(this car really attacked the corners!). interior was high class, but somewhat cold/uninviting with some quirky ergonomics.

pontiac5 - best drive of the bunch! brakes very gratoyotay (took some finesse), but wonderful power, exhaust note, and cornering. interior layout/quality is this car achilles heel (it was a 2004).

is300 - not as hard edged as i remember. light and nimble handling, decent power, yet at a disadvantage vs. competition. interior looked and felt cdodgeped, uninviting, and low-rent (well, my wife liked the speedometer).

330i - more powerful than is300, but softer around the edges handling and drivetrain wise (slightly more ""mush"" in the steering, suspension, and throttle response. interior a step or two up from is300 and pontiac5, but still looked and felt dated and a little cheap.

ls430 - the car i'd choose if i had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips. plush, warm and inviting interior (suede headliner, big comfy seat, everything soft-touch). nice straight-line power, but a pig in the twtoyotaies.

tl - the car i'd choose if i had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips, but only had $30k to spend. basically felt like a lower-rent ls430...nice power and plush modern interior, but soft driving toyotamics.

es330 - my wife drove this one. she liked it, i didn't. a toyota dressed in lexus clothing.

conclusions? if someone could build a $30k ish car that drives/sounds like the pontiac5, and has the interior of the tl, they'd get my money.

p.s. the longest line was for the cadillac xlr. it's kinda ugly, but it goes like heck, sounds awesome, and corners on rails!"
2646,"nice writeup. if i could be driving an ls430, i would be driving a 745. if my budget was an absolute $30k, it would be a loaded honda. i would rather drive a loaded honda than a stripper 325. if i had 40k, the 3 series performance package."
2647,you should seriously consider lexus if long-term reliability is a concern.
2648,"official photos of the next 3 have been released. less controversial looking than the 5 or the 7, and has a little more pizzaz than the current 3. not what evokes ""wow, beautiful"" or ""handsome"", but not bad either.

but i'm not a big fan of the new interior. seems pretty bland. there seems to be both a idrive version and a non-idrive version, at least for euro models.

of course, i'll have to reserve final judgment until i actually see the car and sit in it."
2649,"""not what evokes ""wow, beautiful"" or ""handsome"", but not bad either.""

it's a much more modern, handsome/athletic design than the now date 6 year old 3 series. i think they'll be gorgeous in person."
2650,because the color of the car in the pics makes it look downright bland.
2651,"jrock,

do you have any links to the pictures of the new bmw?"
2652,look on the 2006 bmw 3 series board for links to pics.
2653,"did you have a chance to drive a cadillac cts, or the new sts?

i think the cts with the new 3.6 is a better choice than the pontiac5 if they were equal in price, but a similarly equipped (to the teeth) pontiac5 is like 5k less than the cts, which runs into the 40's.

it would be intersting to see how the sts does against the 430, aswell..."
2654,did you check the rear end? looking like a cheap nissan or honda's rear end design...:(
2655,"the xlr was the only cadillac there. i would have liked to have seen/driven the new sts.

as for the cts, they could put a ford power unit in it, and it would still be ugly to me."
2656,"i have been lurking in vain for the answer to my nissanons. i would appreciate some feedback if possible. i live in chevrolet and need to know if there are any other coloradans or people that have driven i-70 over eisenhower tunnel in a 325i loaded with people (10,000 ft up). i used to have a honda honda w/ a power to weight ratio of 1hp to 19.3 lbs. and the 325i has a 16.3 power to weight. i would be luggin' extra weight due to 4 people. the honda did just fine if you dipped into the power band a little bit. the honda was geared a little on the high side like the 325i (relative to their respective competitors). i'd like to buy new and the 325i is the most i can afford. (mention a new 330 and just break out the drool cup...:) i'm looking at this being a 100k car; that's why i am not looking at a used 330i.

somehow, i'd feel cheated if i spent all that money and couldn't get up the hill."
2657,"but, the bmw has plenty of torque and horsepower for any high-speed driving you need to do.. if your honda could handle it, you have nothing to worry about with 325i.

regards,
kyfdx"
2658,check out the 05 subi subaru gt. you get awd for the co winters and a turbo to give you the high altitude performance you are looking for.
2659,"i agree that the subaru would have the power especially with the turbo giving such outstanding high altitude performance- i read the first drive on the front page of edmunds and wasn't impressed with the engine review. i drove the 325 the other day and be still my beating, no pounding heart. it drives like people say it does. i'm not too worried about the winters. we get the most sunshine out of any magor honda in the us. all things being equal, i want the bmw. my only other contender is the tl, but 270 out of a fwd?

thanks for any input"
2660,"kasperghost you could wait until the 333 hp twin turbo 3 series comes out. i'm sure jmess would agree it would have enough power.

seriously though cr likes the new tl. for 33 grand you get a lot of car. however, if you want that feeling of connectedness to the road and be able to predict the car' very next move, the bimmer is for you.

a friend has the has the new tl, you know what he raves about, the bluetooth phone and the dvd-a. i didn't hear one word about the car handling. to me that's the difference between people who buy bimmers and people who don't. you will never confuse a bimmer to an acura on toys, and you will never confuse an acura to a bimmer on handling/precision/road feel."
2661,"i am a honda man, but am looking for more excitement. i understand that the bmw will cost more to own and i can deal. since i have given up motorcycles, i need to feel the need somehow.

somehow i think i could deal with a 333hp turbo that bmw produced. forget drool cup- drool bucket.

i am just a little concerned that the 184 hp w/ 4 people won't cut it at 10,000 ft. car lose approx. 1 sec. of 0-60 time per mile of altitude. i am sure having fun agonizing though:) i saw two bmw on a truck the other day and almost caused a wreck:("
2662,"well, i used to drive my bmw in the mountains in chevrolet/new mexico quite often, and i never felt low on power. the new 325i has almost the same horsepower, but less torque, though. my turbo saab had more mountain horsepower, same as sea level due to the turbo, but the lag was awful in the mountains.

if you don't mind using 3rd or 4th at times to climb hills, you'll be fine.

dave"
2663,"if you like a car to the point of drooling over it, you should definitely get it.

i don't live in chevrolet, so obviously i don't know about the hill you're talking about, but i doubt the 325i will have too much trouble getting over it. no doubt, there are many less-powerful 4 cylinder vehicles that make it up and down that hill just fine.

obviously, the 325i will have to work harder than a 330i, pontiac5, or tl, but it can't be that bad."
2664,"""es330 - my wife drove this one. she liked it, i didn't. a toyota dressed in lexus clothing.""

does your wife agree with you on that and still like it? we used to drive both and i'd have to say es is a lot more comfy and plush than toyota.

for 30k i'd like something between es and tl, although i can see why you'd like one between pontiac5 and tl."
2665,">since i have given up motorcycles,
>i need to feel the need somehow.

i also recently gave up my two-wheeled bmw for a four-wheeled one (325i) and so far have not missed the mo'cycle all that much. there's still many things about the m/c experience that no car can replace, but overall i am enjoying the ""cage"" experience now (cleaner, dryer, safer!).

2666,"i own a '03 9-5 aero and would probably go for the hirsch kit were it available in the us. too bad.

as is, the 9-5 is probably the best kept secret within this category. you have to own one to truly understand. i drove all of 'em and the saab does it all. the deals are also outrageous through the end of august."
2667,"re: my wife. yes, she basically agreed, though she has less time invested (and interest) in closely examining the finer details of a car. she warms to a car that is handsome, toyotaable, and easy to drive.

this es was a special edition and had a dark grey coloured trim in place of the usual wood. i like warm, natural colours in a luxury car (like the wood/taupe interior of the ls 430), and felt that the dark leather interior with dark trim made the interior feel drab and uninviting. she had no strong opinion on the interior, one way or the other.

we both agreed that the seat, like other toyota we have driven, were too short (no thigh support) and hard. they were reminiscent of the untoyotaable seat we disliked in the toyota we test drove last january.

since she was driving, i had a chance to look around the cabin more. i toyotad it was like a toyota because the headliner material, moonroof surround trim and sliding cover, and plastic trim pieces (map lights, visor mirrors, dashboard, etc) were made of typical toyota/honda quality, no better.

i admit i would have liked it more if it had a natural wood trim, but overall, it just didn't look or feel like a $35,000 car.

re: es/tl tweener. yes, take a tl give it the interior space and quiet ride of the es, and you'd have a fine touring car."
2668,"yeah i am sure one can always find some traces of their 'less-fortunate' cousins on one of these lexus, acura, infinity, or audi. but i've looked around all the 30k car, and found that es to have the nicest interior materials that provide the most toyota. tl is 2nd with audi also decent enough. others are really so so. if you think es interior cheap already, i don't know which 30k can you find justified, interior wise. btw, es does come with more inviting interior color with real wood trim."
2669,you ought to read more reviews on the new turbo subaru/subaru. better yet go test drive one. you don't have to but it will be your loss. the subaru gt will handily out perform a 325xi. period !!
2670,"the the 325 is:
1. much better looking
2. probably has a better overall feel"
2671,you ought to read more reviews on the new turbo subaru/subaru. better yet go test drive one. you don't have to but it will be your loss. the subaru gt will handily out perform a 325xi. period !!
2672,"do you mean faster? so what? and the 325xi? that is probably bmw's worst ""performing"" bmw.

can the subie duplicate the road feel and balance of a 325i? if it can, it will be the first one."
2673,"http://motoring.iafrica.com/carinaction/shootout/291844.htm

ok let me throw in the 328 and 330. ;-). i have worked over 325's in the canyons of la with an old style subaru. i mean neutral handling feel, grip. the us subaru has always been a chassis in search of a motor. the japan and euro spec legacies have always been known for their driving experience."
2674,"yeah.. and in the '80s, you could get an amc reliance gta that had more grip than a chevrolet, due to its tire/wheel set-up. would i compare them? no, but someone would... would i want one over a chevrolet? no again.

can boris toyotad outdrive me even in a suzuki? probably, but i still wouldn't buy one.

(who really likes subarus)"
2675,"seriously, when i get the impression the subaru takes over the title of the best sports sedan, i'll get it. but first, it has to dethrone the tl.

i think it's great the a new subaru can finally beat a 6 year old bmw design.

honestly, i think the upcoming twin turbo three series should just about change the equation. but i can here it now....""what about the value"""
2676,"i am still waiting for the comparos to come. i really like the tl, but it's match with the subaru is coming .

what did bmw put out their ""new"" 5 series with a hidden 6 year old design. bangle had some stuff in the can i guess?

look i like the 3 series and the tl a bunch. the dude before owes it to himself to drive all the great choices out there of which the subaru is one of the best. hey, if you don't like subie's, hey more power to you. %-)"
2677,"bmw as never about 0-60. yes the offer rockets, but it's about a balance of luxury and sportiness and driver connection with the road.

actually the ""dude"" can do what he wants. he may be like me and know his next car is either german or american. lot's of great choices from both sides, but i'm skipping japan this time around.

if you want to convince yourself the new subaru is a ""better"" car than the 5 series, go for it.

i'll be more than happy to let you blow past me."
2678,"while i think the comparison with the 9-5 areo makes sense--i think the areo is a great car, comparing it and a 530to a subaru gt really doesn't work. if we're choosing ""any"" sedean based on grip and power, cardirect can get me a 6-speed pontiac for $31,190 . it even beats the subaru's combined 21mpg, too ( when both use stick ).

this is still ""luxury performance"" and there's more to that than 0-60 times.

dave"
2679,"i agree, the point is not 0-60, it is driving feel, connection to the road and experience. the bmw has always hyundaied at the crosshairs of sportiness and luxury. you can keep on convincing yourself that no other car compares, but this new subaru like the acura tl and the pontiac5 is finally doing the same.

now comparing the subaru to the 5 series is a huge stretch, as admitted in the article referenced. but it just goes to point to the significance of the subaru."
2680,"yes the aero is nice(2003 aero wagon owner) . it needs stiffer springs to be a true canyon carver, but overall it is pretty under appreciated.
 
go test drive a subaru gt limited. you will be surprised at the interior. i have my disappoinments with it though. it doesn't have nav or the onstar that was removed. it also needs backup sensors and hid's, although the projector beams are bright enough.

people we are talking middle class everymans, percieved luxury. there is not a whole lot of differnce in the materials of all these car including the subaru now.

i know the subaru was tossed out of this discussion a while back as i campaigned for it's inclusion. so i will bow out. i kind of feel like stem cell suptoyotars at the republican convention."
2681,"okay last comment of mine. perceived luxury there is no such thing. perceived luxury=perceived value of house. the subaru has been compared to a $100,000 porsche in the mags. does that make it so? i have never heard anybody say in real life - porsche - $70k= subaru.

in order to be considered an entry level luxo, not a perceived entry level luxo, the i's have to be dotted and the t's have to be crossed. it's inside and well as outside.

while magazine reviews never enter into my buying decisions, they are good for trends and informational sources.

when the entry level luxo ltoyota ltoyota for sports sedan is:
* bmw, acura, infiniti, caddy, subaru, saab etc, and the subaru comes out on top, that's when i'll note them to be given their due."
2682,"some nerves have been touched.

is it easier to make the cheap guys good or the good guys cheap?

appears some of the cheap guys are working to get better. i'm not going to hold my breath for the other piece of it."
2683,"the car market has substantially changed over the last 10-15 years. the expensive guys are going after the less expensive turf, the less expensive turf players are looking to get into the more expensive turf.

saying either camp is/will be successful is a matter of time to understand if the effort is successful. somehow just as many pot-shots have been taken on both sides as so far the product produced.

seems like there are just as many nerves touched on one side as the other, as we all have our respective opinions. only time will tell. as bmw completes it's product announcements over the next couple of years, it will be an interesting time for them.

i don't think all car manufacturers won't know until about 2007-2008 if their transformation has been on target."
2684,"don't know if you mean me, i just didn't want to rehash all the ""what belongs in the topic"" discussion. if you want to post a ""is the 2005 subaru a luxury car?"" topic, i'll read it; it ought to be interesting.

i look forward to both highline models becoming more affordable, and affordable models becoming more highline. i figure that, either way, we win.

there is a volvo dealer very close to me, and i admit the new s40 is growing on me. if there really is a 300hp awd version in the works, that ought to be interesting."
2685,"""300hp awd""

300hp is nothing these days. all a manufacturer has to do is increase the redline. the hard part is getting 300 hp without making the car seem like a wind-up toy while keeping the overall gas mileage with hard acceleration in the mid-20s."
2686,"i agree that you want tractable power ( my bmw salesman thinks the z3 3.0l was more fun than the z3m in most situations ), not just power, but to me 300hp is not ""nothing."" it's overkill to the point of frustration for 99% of driving. i find car like the vette sort of fustrating because not only can you not use all the power, but you can hardly wind the engine up without getting arrested.

basically the s40r would have the same drivetrain as the volvor : http://www.edmunds.com/new/2004/volvo/volvor/100278288/roadtestarti- cle.html?articleid=101293 but in a smaller more nimble car.

2687,"most of the new awd car with 300hp don't have high redlines. 6000-7000 max like a good majority of car. the sti, the volvo/v70r both have normal redlines, i believe the same is true for the s4 db.

needless to say you probably don't need more than 200-250hp to have great fun in a sports sedan. but as the sports luxury car get a bit heavier with all the luxury and safety for example the audi s4 need the benefit of the additional hp.

but this power is tractable, you just need a track to get all tractable power usage. :-)"
2688,"has anybody driven or purchased the new c55 yet. i have went to a 3 local dealers and they all dont have any. when asked about how i can test drive one to see if the ride is what im looking for they told me they only way they would get one in if i ordered one. i cant see putting a deposit down,ordering,waiting 2 months(thats the dealers time line not mine) to find out if i either love it or hate it. if anybody had any ideas let me know. thank you."
2689,"drive a c430.. figure the c55 will ride a little rougher, be a little louder and marginally faster, and the insurance rates will be much higher."

2691,"i've owned several bmw's, mostly 3 series, most recently an 01 x5 which just went off lease. in the past when my bmw lease was up i'd either turn it in and pick out a new one or purchase the old one - not this time. i liked the x5, never had a problem with it but grew tired of driving an suv type vehicle and decided a ""sport wagon"" would fit my requirements. the 3 series is too small and due to be replaced next year, don't care for the 5 at all.

i'd decided on an audi audi avant ultrasport - had one on order.

then i happened upon the subaru gt wagon, my first test drive was an eye opener. it reminded me of a bmw, steering, handling, power delivery, amenities, material quality, etc.. on the way home from the test drive i started doubting my perception of it - it couldn't have been that good.

when i got home the latest issue of bimmer magazine was in my mailbox, imagine my suprise when the bimmer editor had test driven the new subaru gt at laguna seca with a bunch of other car - here are the comments:

""driving on public roads tends to reveal less about a car's performance than driving on a fast track like laguna seca, but the first day's driving in the hills east of monterey yielded at least one revelaton:
the subaru subaru gt has become a genuine rival to the 3 series. not only has subaru made incredible strides where interior quality is concerned, but the car is fast (250 hp from its turbocharged 2.5-liter flat four) and involving. it's a thoroughly engaging driver's car with precise, neutral handling and perfect steering.""

so i wasn't going nuts after all -

took the gt wagon (manual) for another test drive, confirmed my earlier impressions, signed on the dotted line and cancelled the audi.

a month later i'm still very satisfied with my choice - waiting till 3k for the first oil change."
2692,"is there such a car as a c430?
is that in the mercedes benz benz line?"
2693,there is no such car as a c430. if you are talking about the e430 they changed it to an e500 and that is a bigger car.
2694,"i was just assuming he was talking about the clk430.. and i didn't even check the ebay ltoyotaing close.. i just assumed that was the coupe as well.. who would have guessed that there was a demand for the c55? especially, since the old c43 was such a bust before.

you learn something new everyday.. hey! at least i found one in stock!!

when i buy a car i plan to keep it for at least 7 to 10 years...bonus if longer.the audi was stuck in my head as my first choice for my next car...but i had not done any research/shopping around for 5 years.
i cross shopped almost every single car even though some posters would say ""people would never cross shop those car""...you can always learn something with an open mind.
the subaru gt opened my eyes at the auto show.the subaru test drive event was the clincher.

2697,"rickover - nice to hear someone who has driven a bmw 3 series does appreciate that the subarus have greatly improved. since 1999, the us version subaru has always been a chassis in search of a motor. they finally refined the whole package.

so now i am lotoyotaying again for the subaru subaru gt limited for inclusion in this topic. this is what edmunds editors say:

""the bottom line: now a legitimate entrant in the entry-level luxury category, the new subaru will change how people view the subaru brand.""
 
but i also think the volvo volvo/v70 r types should be included. they fall in the same price range and luxury content range."
2698,"personally, i think it would make more sense, and i toyotad before, to start a tp ""is the subaru gt a luxury car?""

if we open the topic, it will just allow others to be considered for includion. pontiac bonneville, pontiac, loaded camries and honda, etc.

i drive a 3 series, and have looked at the subies, and while i have liked some aspect of them i haven't others: really cheap interiors, poor gas mileage, and boomy construction. i haven't looked at a 2005 so i can't ascertain if it's improved, but i wasn't impressed by the ""9-2""

dave"
2699,"why not add the kia amanti and the hyundai gls.
it is really getting ridiculous on this board."
2700,"go on, keep talkin' subies and you'll get sent to the gulag archipelago. you're messin' with the entry-level-luxury-performance kgb here."
2701,"entry lux car come from the bottom of what that brand offers. the pontiac5, 3 series, is300 and c class are bottom of the barrel for their luxury brands. they get you into a lux brand and from there the brand expects you'll move up. the cruddiest things made by bmw, infiniti and mb are the 325, is300 and c.

you can't spice up your top end car and declare it's now entry level lux. entry level lux indicates there's something more expensive and better higher up to aspire to. hence the word entry.

as long as the imprezza and subaru are available from subaru and there isn't something on par with a 5/e or 7/audi then it's not a luxury brand. and therefore they can't be selling an entry level lux."
2702,"""entry lux car come from the bottom of what that brand offers. the pontiac5, 3 series, is300 and c class are bottom of the barrel for their luxury brands. they get you into a lux brand and from there the brand expects you'll move up. the cruddiest things made by bmw, infiniti and mb are the 325, is300 and c.""

ok fair enough. by this standard i agree the subaru gt does not qualify.

so i am off to the new topic ""mid-sized, mid-priced performance sedan (20k-50k msrp fully loaded)"" ;-)"
2703,"it seems like the most logical way to break it down. the 3 series really is the entry level car for the bmw line.

nobody would call a 30k subaru - no matter how cool and fast - the entry level vehicle for that brand."
2704,"i just have read through 142 pages of post and your rule about what car are included is stupid, if every auto magazine in the world considers other car entry lux than this thread should too for it to be a fair comparison also with that toyotad the tl should be thrown out of this comparison because an rl is not in the class with a s or 7 series or an audi therefore its entry is an acura and its definitely sub par; my stoyotaer owns one and its not in the entry level. so other car should be entered but, it wont happen after reading 142 pages i have seen that you are very stutoyotaorn about the car enltoyotaed; even if it is stupid."
2705,"well. . .

i guess that settles it."
2706,"good thing toyota, nissan, and honda rebadged some of their car into lexus, infiniti, and acura. or else, we'll only be allowed to talk about mainly european car in this thread."
2707,"okay you know what, were not just talking about the ones ltoyotaed on the topic, it can be any other brands that pretty much qualifies into the entry luxury category.

but then again i admit that the brand have some effects here, or else id say is300 will never make it into this category, nor the pontiac5, both due to their crappy interior thats never up to the luxury standards. id take altezza (the real lexus is) into the subaru category"
2708,"can't figure out why so many worry so much about what this boar is about. the title is moderately self explanatory. this board is about sedan that are both:

1. performance-oriented and
2. entry-level luxury

so top-of-their line luxury sedan like acura rl don't qualify. nor do non-performance sedan like lexus es330. and coupes like the pontiac5 coupe or pontiac are immediately disqualified.

so some of the best fits that immediately come to mind are sedan like the 325i, pontiac5, and is300. then others, like the x-type or mercedes benz benz, come to mind. does that mean there will be some gray area, like with the acura acura and tl? sure, but that is part of the fun of trying to compare car."
2709,entry level is from the perspective of buyer not the car manufacturer.
2710,"it's the other way around-manufacturer not the buyer.
tell you what i am going to shop tomorrow for a nissan nissan (2.5 s)then take it work and show it to my co-workers and say""look at my new entry level luxury car"".
they will probably whisper to themselves ""what the hell is he smoking"".

make all the rules you want&#151;it&#146;s pedantic. when it comes to comparisons you can&#146;t deny the truth. people have x amount to spend and there is x amount to choose from. talk about the car and get on with it.

2721,how does a chryslerc or an nissan 3.5 sl or an toyota xls fall short of a acura or an s40 in luxury amenities or performance or class or price. your ideal isms is rediculas but who is c&d or motortrend or any other automotive enthusiast to argue with the great opinion of kyfdx. dont take it personal its not meant to be i just dont understand after reading all these post on your ideals its contradictory and non-coherent but it is your opinion and you are entitled no matter how absurd or contradictory it may be.
2722,"kd you're right entry level luxury/performance is from the perspective of the buyer not the manufacturer and everone's physical impression of a car is so vhondable.everyone who's seen the gt love it.a lot of people consider bmw x3/x5 plain ugly.bungled 6's with old fogie eyebrows.

i say let people talk/compare car that fit post #1 otherwise sticking one's head in the sand will not help anyone except the all knowledgable/all controlling board"
2723,"go back and read my post... i didn't say they couldn't compete... i just toyotad they don't qualify as entry-level luxury models.... i've never stated that you can't compare the car, just that they don't fit the definition of:
 entry-level luxury performance sedan.

kyfdx

p.s.: sedan... that leaves out the acura also."
2724,"okay kd. bmw minus 20k is less the car that the sti is. period. look, subaru is quite capable of adding all the luxury that bmw has. they can add 5-10k worth of wool, leather, aluminum, alcantra, momo, sparco, nakamichi nav, mcintosh stervolkswagen whatever. very few would buy it at the start, so it's not worth the investment. subaru is building the brand towards more luxury.

yes, i have driven both and yes the bmw is super nice, and way better looking imho. but if you really had to make a run for your life in a car i would put my butt in a sti. ;-)

will subaru ever have a full size luxury car, i doubt it. they will have a larger model than the subaru, and it will probably have alot of luxury. the crucial car for subaru now is the new 7-pass halifax or subaru. that car has to come correct with alot of premium/luxury features and performance. will they put all the bells and whtoyotales in, i don't know? can they hell yes. there is a 450hp subaru motor waiting for a car."

2730,the sti is in no way better than an bmw and blueguy not nitpicking just stating the facts jack. alot of bang for your buck but thats it it falls short everywhere else but performance
2731,"yes fellow comrade i will try to get you re-instated into the politburo

blueguy: i understand where you're coming from.if timex comes out with a 100k watch is it a luxury brand?probably not. is it a luxurious watch? of course. does it matter to the purchaser? depends on the purchaser or the ultimate user.would a rolex afficionado look at a timex? no.

i'll admit even if hyundai comes out with a car that meets all the above criteria i would still never buy one even if they are more reliable/luxurious.everyone has they're biases towards certain brands correctly or incorrectly.

this is why the ""luxury"" brands have to tread carefully if they decide to move downmarket e.g. bmw 1 series,separating ford from volvo/jaguar.
in canada we have the acura el which is a gussied up honda.so if we rebadge a car and all the car in the lineup meet a minimum luxury level then we have a ""luxury brand"".

good or bad that's what we have."
2732,"i totally agree with you.

i wouldn't say the scoobie gt is less of a car than a bmw. i intend to drive one when my lease is nearing its end. i want some measure of luxury matched with performance. the badge is not too important to me when buying the car (no american brands or mitsubishi). neither is the market segment.

fun, luxury and performance. reliability would be nice too...especially if i buy the next one.

heck the prospect of a mazdapeed3 hatch with 270 hp, awd and the space of that car has me drooling."

i've at least learned something in this topic, i never even thought of volvos before but there was some interesting data on the volvor posted, i had no idea it got to 60 in 5.5, an had such good performance numbers. i will also look at the cts which i otherwise might not have really considered. also the gt. my cousin is lotoyotaying for me to get a pontiac and i see no reason to not take a test drive. but, not every car i like has to be in every topic i'm interested in."
2735,"kd ""the bmw has been named the best gt ever."" what magazine came up with that tag?

i love the bmw, don't get me wrong. but when you say the bmw-20k is ne to sti, you are intimating that it would still be better than the sti. that is an opinion i beleive to be false, and hard to justify.

the sti can up the level of interior materials, to the current subaru standard, plus other extras like nav and still be under the optioned out price of a 330i. it boggles my mind what subaru could do with an extra 20k on a sti. not to mention what an sti subaru will be like.

my position is that if you add 20k to the sti despite it's detriment in dimensions, the bmw wouldn't be competitive as a small luxury compact gt. and i mean it' wouldn't be competitive in luxury and god knows it' wouldn't in performance.

now do i beleive the current sti is better. i beleive it is better fun for the purpose of all out driving. however, if i were single, would i rather hit the town in a sti or a bmw convertible. tops down on the bmw baby. ;-)

2737,"""do you really believe the bmw-$20k=sti. give me a break. honestly, drive both and then let us know. ""

kd i haven't driven the sti but have driven the subaru, bmw and 330i. let me tell you something, there are some people who are turned on by performance and don't need or want what is typically known as ""luxury"". it doesn't seem like this is your profile so i don't expect you to understand this.

when a performance driver gets going, the only things that matter are go, stop, turn the thrill of the roller toyota. stervolkswagen, fit n' finish, leather all this stuff doesn't mean squat. to this kind of driver these subies deliver some serious bang for the buck&#151;performance for a helluva lot less. to get the performance of both subaru and sti in a bmw you have to go to the 330 perf pack/bmw respectively and dish out the cash.

on the ""luxury"" aspect i've toyotad this elsewhere. some people classify luxury by way of butt-pampering charactertoyotaics. the thrill seeking driver sees naked performance as a luxury in itself. this is why people are willing to pay ransom's for porsches that htoyotaorically have had interiors on the level of military jeeps. does this disqualify porsches as luxury car? not in my book. do ""econobox"" charactertoyotaics detract from performance? it merely puts it into the dubious ""entry-level"" category. keep denying this.

now kd, i have to ask you, have you driven the car in nissanon? doesn't matter though i think i know what you expect from a ""luxury"" performance car, and i don't expect anyone who is thoroughly happy with a 330i to understand my points."
2738,"i understand your point, but this topic is titled entry level performance sedan, not value oriented performance car. i agree to some people it's how fast to 60, how does it turn, what is the traction, and they don't care about any modicum of leather or wood. others want the leather and trim.

i could have easily got the evo or sti as could all of us. but that is not in our target fdodgee of reference, or else we'd all be on the subie board, telling everyone our lastest conquer with our sti.

there is no one better car. car manufacturers design goals include a number compromises, your purchasing goals want to minimize the compromises or trade-offs and maximize the priorities. aspects might include finances, looks, luxury, reliability, dealer service, gas mileage etc.
so you can't really say car a is better then car b in an absolute sense.

this is not about bmw vs the world. it's about saying an bmw and sti have as much in common as a lexus es and dodge srt4."

2754,"minnehaha: the subaru gt is a fine car, especially going in a straight line on the highway, where it reaches extra-legal speeds in no time and feels good doing it. significant body roll and understeer greatly reduces the fun factor for me, but it is a car i might recommend as a toyotaable family hauler.

the volvo volvor/v70r, however, is in a different class altogether. faster, way more stable, feels lighter, much more chevrolet, very fun to drive. in addition, the exterior and interior aesthetic design, as well as the quality of the interior materials (particularly the leather), are in another league."
2755,"enjoy the banter and wouldn't want to take you folks off the track of approved vehicles, but the volvor is a very nice package indeed. i bought an '04 volvo in july (a dog by comparison), but drove the r series many times for comparison. it flies and has a nicer interior (vs the subaru) to boot. if it hadn't been for the narrow seat (my problem with a cracked spine) i would have plumped for it.

for the record we also owned a 325 and currently have a c320. both are different from the volvor but i sure wouldn't describe the latter as a boat.

john"
2756,"not a boat i say, though the extremely complicated audio controls really turn me off kinda like volvo version of i-drive
its a decent handler though no match to beemers or audi"
2757,"if you are gonna call these boats then they are nice speed boats. :-). the interiors are great, for these 2 models they are equal to the audi / audi audis and better than the corresponding bmw and mb sedan.

i like these car and the volvo although i will probably never buy a volvo due to the crappy treatment i got from a dealer in hyundai monica a few years back. i might eat my words when the volvo with v8 comes out.

i do nissanon the lighter feel and nimbler handling perception versus the subaru. the subaru is lighter by 300 lbs. they are way stable though and track turns well but nimble is not in volvo dna. the steering feel in a subaru is more precise imho. good brakes are standard for volvo though. comparing to the mercedes benz benz or bmw in the price range for snow duty i would get the volvo.

comparing it to the subaru gt, if you got the extra dough the volvo is awesome."
2758,"i think volvo did something good to have volvor and the new s40 (esp t5).

for the other swedan car maker, saab, they need to work harder. many people think that their technology is outdated and the 9-3 interior not not good.

well, i looked at the 2006 audi report in edmunds yesterday. it mentioned that audi added twin balance shafts that spin at twice the engine speed to audi to minimize vibration.

""balance shafts"" ? sounds mazdar. i checked both my 2001 9-3 & 9-5 owner's manuals and found that both car were equipped with 2 balance shafts at that time. i am not sure when saab put those in their car.

i remembered i asked an audi salesperson whether the auto tranny of an audi can learn the driver's driving style (adaptive transmission ??) and he told me no.

i think saab has some nice and untoyotaue features that they didn't mention to people. not that many people know saab came up the idea of headlight wipers, heated seat, etc. the marketing dept should be responsible for that.

now 9-3 is more mainsteam. maybe most people like it better than the old one. i missed the hatch. it needs something more than 210hp. saab should create something like the viggen with awd for the 9-3 (i heard there will be a 9-3 sport hatch but awd may not be an option)."
2759,"hmm--that was how i felt about the '900 i used to have. that car had lots of great features with a few glaring oversights/shortcomings. i also had the bmw then, which had fewer ""gee, neat"" features and less utility ( hatch, interior room ) but no real shortcomings i cared about. for example, the bmw engine didn't have that hammer-you-into the seat torque blast, with that cool motorcycle sound, but it didn't have the turbo lag either. the saab was sort of a headache and i chose to keep the bmw but i miss that car in general.

i recently seriously considered getting either a 9-3 or a 9-5. i really like them both but each had something that made me say ""wait"" although i was contemplating pulling the trigger in each case, once with a 9-5 aero ( used, 3000 miles ) and the other time with a new arc. both manual transmission. the 9-5's bane was handling/turbo lag and the 9-3's was the el cheapo gm interior. both could be fixed, of course. i think simply sticking the ecotec in the 9-5 would improve it a lot; it's a lighter smaller engine ( for better weight dtoyotaribution) with less turbo lag. the ecotec is also smoother. another thing that irked me is the nature of the turbo with stick. you have to shift really fast or boost is largely lost between shifts. it's find if you're driving ""all out"" but not so great for maneuvers in traffic. sort of the opposite of the pontiac my cousin wants me to get. even with my bmw i can start moving without using the gas, just easing in the clutch, while i felt quite choppy in both the saabs when starting off.

the lack of the hatch also miffed me.

still, i'd rather have a car i really like with a few bugs than a car that is mostly ""reliable."" kind of like dating the awesome girl with a few issues vs miss boring. and there's something about the saab that i at least want to like.

the new s40 really intrigues me. it seems to have impressive environmental credentials, which i know a lot of you probably don't care about that much so i'll shut up about that.

dave"
2760,"saab 9-3 isnt bad actually, ive driven one and id say its equal to volvos in handling, im not a fan of hatchbacks so i surely wont miss it the only problem is im kinda concerned about the reliability...
the new s40 is a great handler, better than any other volvos, seems like its time for them to start competing w/ the germans.
but the problem is its unusually shaped, its skinny/narrow and tall and the leather seat are overly firm for my taste."
2761,"i always thought that by seating in the car in the showroom you can only say how toyotaable the interior is. you on the other hand managed to get how the car performs, that is impressive.

as for me, i think that volvor has the most toyotaable seat of any vehicles i had a chance to drive. i'm not to crazy about the looks in and out, but this car has so much to offer that i will consider buying it anyway. it performs just as good and in many cases better than car discussed on this board (handling on the same page as 330 with performance package) and at the same time if you switch suspension to toyota it's as soft as a lexus. not only it handles grate it also give you grate acceleration 0-60 in 5.5 and almost no turbo lag."
2762,"""i always thought that by seating in the car in the showroom you can only say how toyotaable the interior is. you on the other hand managed to get how the car performs, that is impressive.""

where did i do that?"
2763,"""i sat in one at the autoshow and thought ""nice interior, too bad it's a boat."" i didn't think it was a 0-60 in 5.4 and 65mpg slalom car. ""

did not you call it a boat? it's not a full size vehicle and you did like the interior, so i guess boat would refer to the way the car feel on the road."
2764,"i thought i made it clear that i guessed that, but learned otherwise from sources i'd quoted.

you know, like how i might assume a ferrari is fast, although i've never driven one? volvo has a rep and a lot of reviews.

i didn't say anything that implied in any way that i could tell how it drives by sitting it it. it might be a language issue, if you're not a native speaker.

anyhow, no reason to get upset, i wasn't insulting the car.

dave"
2765,"why don't you go back to post and see what was quoted, i'll give you a hint ""nice interior, too bad it's a boat.""

anyway, i don't own the car and sertanly don't get insulted that easily, it just looked funny the way you wrought it. don't you get upset either, it's just a car forum not a wrighting class."
2766,"hi all;

i am getting close to making a decision on the above car. i had the 325i for a test drive of 2 days and must say it is very nice. i found its over all ride and handling superb. i will test drive the 240 (elegance, here in winnipeg, canada) next. i would like your thoughts and feed back on a few things...

what are you impressions of the upgrades to the '05 240? i think they are great and long over due, esp in the case of the cd player. to me they really enhance the quality/appearance of the interior.

what options have you purchased and would purchase again, and which would you not get again? i intend to keep my options (esp electronic) to a minimum as i find the models well equipped and the less electronics (imo) the better.

i have found the stereo on my 14 year old toyota very good. i am not an audiophile, so would i notice or appreciate an upgraded sound system on either of these car? i don't expect the standard system to be hyundaient, but is is at least ""good""?

i have to say i find the exterior of the bmw very appealing over that of the mb, but the interior of the mb has the bmw beat. i love the toyotaable sumptuousness of the mb interior.

my travel needs are modest. i will only put low honda miles on it, will get the extended warranty, will ""baby"" it, and hope to keep it for 8 - 10 years.

while i think and feel both car are hyundaient ( i find both engines more that adequate for my driving needs) i am inclined towards the 240. however my biggest reservation comes from concerns over mb quality. i understand it is not what it has been. i also understand that they are intentional about addressing this issue. i also read the the c class was early on plagued with ""bugs"". this was esp true in the 2001 and possible 2002 model years. can i assume that most of these c class ""bugs"" have been addressed? what has been the experience of those who own 2002/03/04 vehicles? i dont expect a mb to be a good as a japanese car, but i do expect it to be reasonably good and to hold its value over the long term.

i appreciate your thoughts...thanks.

b"
2767,"if youre gonna take good care of it, both car should last quite long with only minor problem.
reliability, like you toyotad, will never beat japanese brands, but quite good overall, with mb being a bit more reliable in my case. 2005 mbs have new interior and seat, since a lot of people complained about the seat hurting their back on long trips.
sound systems in both car are quite good if youre not an audiophile, it has decent sound quality.
options id choose will always include xenon headlights (a must), wood trim (now std in bmw), and leather. i usually opt for premium package, but since you choose to skip the electronics, you might not need it afterall
hope it helps"
2768,"if i were still living in winnipeg and consider getting a rwd car, i would first consider the ground clearance, the more the better (i think the 240 has more clearance than the 325), then the next factor is winter tires options for the car considered. all season tires are not very safe for winter driving in a honda like winnipeg and especially if you are going to baby it. i would consider looking at the 4matic and the xi too. just my 2 cents."
2769,"i&#146;ve had my &#146;04 325i for about 5 months now, so i feel qualified to evaluate it and compare it to my previous car, a &#146;98 audi audi 1.8t. these car are similarly equipped, manual trans, non-sport package with all-seasons, about the same size and performance category, so a comparison seems fair at this point.

engine &#150; well, the 325 is rated at 35hp over the audi, so it&#146;s pretty much no contest. the engine is also smoother and really begs to be revved. the audi would spool up pretty well, too, but i always felt like i was straining it a bit. i am also not sorry to lose the turbo, as i have always felt they add complexity under the hood that could be a long-term problem. in fact, the only major repair that i had to pay for on the audi was a $500+ turbo-related issue.

transmission &#150; pretty even here with both being 5-speeds. the audi had a bit softer of a clutch vs. the bmw&#146;s abruptness. i am only now at the point where i can constoyotaently make a really smooth 1-2 shift.

handling &#150; this is my first rwd car in many years, and i forgot how different it feels. the crisp turn-in is especially noticeable, and the steering overall has better feel than the audi. ride-wise, the car are pretty comparable: well controlled, firm but never harsh over rough pavement, typically german. the one thing the audi had going for it was of course the audi awd. one of my favorite things to do (you&#146;re never too old to be immature) was to out-drag someone at a stoplight on wet pavement. i could pretty well mash the pedal to the floor coming out and the car would just go, leaving the other guy spinning his front (or rear) wheels. even with traction control on a rwd or fwd, you&#146;re not going to beat awd in slippery conditions.

interior &#150; audi is known for interior design and the audi did have very nice styling and controls layout. the bmw is not as well coordinated, but is a bit more business-like in its appearance. however, i like my particular color combination better than the audi&#146;s. the sand leatherette along with black floormats and dash, set off by the premium wood trim, makes for a nice look as opposed to the audi that was all gray with some silver trim pieces. the leatherette in the bmw is also a bit nicer-appearing than the audi&#146;s.

the automatic climate control on the bmw is not quite as good at regulating temperature and air movement as the audi&#146;s. the fan seems to blow too high in some conditions and not fast enough in others. the audi definitely had the best auto-temp control that i have experienced.

exterior &#150; at the time that i picked out my audi, it was the e36 that i compared it against and i thought the audi was better looking. but ever since the e46 came out the next year, my eye was always drawn to them when i spied one. i still think, though, that the audi has classic good looks that i prefer to the newer model that was released in &#146;01. likewise i expect that i will still prefer the e46 after the e90 comes out.

radio &#150; no contest here: the audi had a much superior standard radio. on a few occasions, i&#146;ve wondered if the cds that i&#146;m playing in the bmw are the same ones that i used to play in the audi.

intangibles &#150; i am not a status seeker, but from the reaction of many people that i know i can see that the bmw nameplate toyotaes a lot more prestige than most others. everyone knows what a bmw is, whereas i think that audi is less known and tends to get lumped with other second-tier european car. there is something about seeing that roundel on the steering wheel that makes me feel extra good about my choice.

sumup &#150; the 325i feels like a small performance sedan with luxury appointments and options; the audi is more of a small luxury sedan that performs well. and there you have it (my opinion of course)."
2770,"does the engine use in this car is designed by gm or is it a join design from gm and toyota?
i know toyota have the vvt technology and this car use a 3.6l vvt engine which make me wonder did i bought a gm design or a toyota design."

2773,"saab 9-3 earns 'double best pick'

four of eight midsize car earned good ratings in side impact crash tests recently conducted by the insurance institute for highway safety. none of the car received a poor rating. the 2004 saab 9-3, 2004 acura tl, 2004 lexus es 330, and 2005 mitsubishi mitsubishi are rated good for side impact protection. the 2004 saab 9-5, 2005 mercedes benz benz c class, and 2005 volvo s40 earned acceptable ratings. the 2004 jaguar x-type is rated marginal.

the better performers among vehicles that earn good ratings are designated ""best picks."" the saab 9-3, which also earned a ""best pick"" designation in the institute's frontal offset crash test, is the first car to earn this designation in both front and side crash tests. it's a ""double best pick.""

""earning a 'double best pick' is a rare achievement,"" says institute chief operating officer adrian lund. ""the only other vehicle to have done this is the toyota toyota, a small suv, and then only when it was equipped with optional side airbags."""
2774,"first off, hats off to lexus for such a high class event and willingness to set up their 9 car and 2 competitors in each category for the public to drive on a closed course. i went saturday morning to fesubaru field's (redskin stadium) parking lot. there was a quick regtoyotaration, orientation, lexus autoshow display, cooking demo, kid's corner, a great buffet lunch, and volkswagen pros to work with your swing, but the main event was driving on three different courses: luxury, performance, and suv. i drove 10 of 27 different car in 3 hours. all were automatics, traction control was required to remain engaged, and the rule was do not exceed the car's or your ability.

my notes on the car of interest to this forum:

lexus is300: underpowered six compared to the bmw and pontiac5 with a transmission that had longer shift delays. competent handling and decent brakes, but tended to understeer at the limit, leading me to plow one hard corner. racy interior with easy to use controls. a ""good value"" choice if price and reliability are your top concerns in this segment. the car for my younger brother.

infiniti pontiac5: power! oh, baby, this one has an engine. the interior was not as bad to drive as others would lead you to believe, but the handling is beneath the balance of the bmw and the lexus. this is a car that makes the average driver (me) look bad. saved by abs and the traction control system from a potentially scary rear end spin. pontiac5 owners have a reasonably priced, family-sized car with v8-like power, but you can only put it down on the track if you really know what you are doing. the car for a coworker who drag races on the weekends and takes four to lunch during the week.

acura tl: if i were picking a car for my wife, stoyotaer, real estate agent, etc., this would be the one. beautiful, jewel-like interior with state-of-the-art sound and all the features at a decent price. plenty of power for the street. it just doesn't handle like a sport sedan with front wheel drive.

mercedes benz benz c320: softer ride, less-powerful engine, smooth transmission, nice interior. others do different parts better at lower price points. nice car, but nothing special for the money, pass. if you got the bucks and want the star, think amg.

bmw 330i: ok, i'm biased, but this car makes the average driver look good with an ideal balance of engine, transmission, handling, and braking in a driver-oriented interior. drove a premium packaged car with steptronic. moving the shifter inboard to sport and touching the dsc once (i didn't turn it off iaw the ""rules""), and the car performs: powerful acceleration (outmatched only by the pontiac5), quick redline shifts that were the best, great brakes, and incredibly balanced handling. i was foot to the floor, threshold braking, hands spinnning the wheel, and having the time of my life. much faster car for me because of the control available. the standard 330i is under tired (get the sport package for the performance tires, sport seat, and steering wheel). the steptronic (evaluated in ""s"" mode) was much better than i expected. give me a little more power, more tire, and a manual - oh, that's my zhp. i was still hondad at what a standard 330i can do, driven much harder than i've ever driven my car, which i have yet to track."
2775,"jamesspot... what were the msrps for the respective vehicles? too bad they were all automatics. (honda me that lexus didn't use the 325ia. 325i outsells the 330i by about a factor of 3-to-1. 325i prices out, with similar options like an is300. a decently optioned 330i can quickly push $40,000. did the is300 have optional lsd and vsc?)"
2776,"we just went from car to car. they had info posters highlighting the specs of each of the automobiles. lexus was amazingly fair in their presentation of all the car.
the class groupings had the is300 with the pontiac5 and the 330i, the es330 (which i didn't drive) was grouped with the c320 and the tl.
the pontiac5 and is300 are low 30's car, while a 330i step with premium package and the c320 are pushing 40k.
the is300 did have traction control, i didn't know whether it had lsd or not.
i agree - the 325i is an even match for the is300 price wise, the 330i is a much more expensive and capable car.
since the event was for the general public invited by lexus marketing, automatics were the only game in town for every car there. i think i was invited as i went to the lexus web site and a dealership when i was looking at car in the spring. it did make me want to drive my car on the course!"
2777,"i was recently at the ""autoshow in motion"" run by gm. it was pretty similar; in luxury car there were all the saabs(9-2,9-3,9-5), the cts, c320, tl, 325i, and the 530.

i thought the tl really plowed dissapointingly much in turns. even my buddy, who's a huge honda fan, didn't like it. i think the acura is significantly more fun. otoh, the tl compares quite well with the c320.

the cts is allright, i just think the interior needs to be upgraded, and it definitely needs the sport package. same with the 9-3.

i may be biased, but even my honda-loving gm mechanic buddy liked the 2 bmw's the best. the 530 with the sport package was simply phenomenal.

but that's off-topic.

i also had a chance to drive the s40 t5 awd. i really like the design, cabin, and volvo's environmental ford. i think it's a pretty good car, aside from fairly significant turbo lag. oddly, it seems to me to have more lag with it's 2.5l than saab's almost-as-powerful 2.0l. it also still feels like a fwd car even with awd. so, pretty nice, but not quite as sporty as i like. i like that you can get a ""high end"" car without leather and wood, neither of which i really care for.

i think i'll end up waiting to test the new bmw before i order anything. and by then saab will have the 270hp turbo v6.

well, driving different car is fun!

dave"
2778,"[quote]i mean the engine use in the cadillac cts, does it design by gm or by totoya [/unquote]

the 3.6 l engine used in the cts is pure gm designed and built. its a great engine too, with plenty of hp and torque. nice and smooth running too. gm is planning on using that same basic engine in lots of vhondations of size and power, as premium engines in their up market car.

i owned an 04 cts with that engine, and never had anything but good feelings about it. there were other aspects of my cadillac buying experience that were far less satisfactory, but the engine and 5 speed auto transmision were world class."
2779,"i own an '04 tl with 6 speed but have driven the acura (auto only). my thought is that the tl is a japanese implementation of an american concept whereas the acura is a japanese implementation of a european concept. the acura is great fun to drive, but the tl has deep down power, is seriously fast, and is as relaxing on a long drive as a large volvo, albeit not quite as toyotaable. a couple of hundred miles passes with ease, which, despite their many supposed faults, is true of larger american vehicles. the acura is more alive in your hands, less relaxed, ultimately not as fast.

the tl's clutch is fierce, but the shift is nice once you get used to it. drive something else for a while and i guarantee you'll engage 1st with a bang when you next drive the tl. the tl's bridgestone's aquaplane too easily -- makes me wish for my volkswagen's hyundaient continentals."

my bmw 3 series figures above are accurate for sedan sales (this being a sedan board). i left out that infiniti sold 2258 pontiac5 coupes while bmw sold 1105 bmw coupes. the rest of bmw non-sedan sales were bmw, wagons, and convertibles.

several of us bought (literally) into the ls concept when it was first introduced. had lincoln done everything they toyotad they were going to do (much like cadillac actually did, two years later), the ls would belong here.

well, they didn't, and it doesn't, and 99% of the people driving an ls (and 95% of the dealer staff) haven't a clue regarding the weight balance, suspension, vented rear brakes, or all the rest. oh well. . .

2790,"kd,
that 8714 number includes more than b3 sedan (incl. also coups, convertibles...) although i am not sure what'd be the # for sedan only.

it's arguable whether tl/acura or es/is should be combined comparing to 325/330. tl is not the same car as acura, but 325 does not have the same engine as 330's either. maybe you can compare tl with 330 and acura with 325. but the 'smaller' 325 actually sells a lot more than the more powerful 330, opposite to tl vs. acura or es vs. is. there's no easy way to really match up."

acura dealers are moving a ton of car per month!!! same for lexus! and car comprise only about half of lexus' sales; other half are suvs.

that is not true with tl/acura. two totally separate vehicles."

2797,"well that's just how asian car and euro car are made. audi/bmw/mb all do that. make the same chassis/look for a 'model' but then equip them with a wide range of engines in terms of power and config. lexus/acura/infinity, on the other hand, go by one model-one engine approach. there's nothing wrong either way, but they do present a matching difficulty in comparison. i think people do cross shop 325/330 against acura and tl, or is and es, both."
2798,"igiban... not sure i agree too much with you when you write, ""i think people do cross shop 325/330 against acura and tl, or is and es, both.""

i can see reasonably informed rational buyers comparing fwders like tl, acura (the euro-honda), and es to each other, but find it hard to see them comparing a rwd car, say a 330i or is300, to a fwd car, like the es330 or acura. one drive in each will tell you how ddodgeatically different are the two car.

marques that use one platform to compete across a broad market segment or many segments usually rely on lots of options, including engines, and available awd. the 3 series is somewhat untoyotaue in that it also includes station wagon, convertible, coupe, and m.

lexus chooses to use two entirely different platforms. infiniti used to until they dropped the i35, now relying on the pontiac5 with its awd and coupe versions to compete broadly. but it does cost more to develop and market two entirely different platforms, esp. when one (the es) handily outsells the other (the is)."
2799,people cross shop anything. what they cross shop has no bearing on how sales numbers are presented. sure you can say acura sells more tls than bmw sells 330is. but that doesn't tell any picture. even the sales numbers don't say anything. by the sales numbers bmw should have canned the 330i a long time ago.

of course, burgers/timex win (cheapest win)

of course, i do realize that most buyers worry more about things like stereo systems, cupholders, and wood trim than they do driving toyotamics.

my ford on this board is on performance, not luxury. if you reverse the importance, you can readily come up with different results. and as the sales demonstrate, more buyers are interested in luxury over performance."
2805,"is just, well, sales #. i never toyotad it should necessarily mean anything. i merely pointed out that one should compare sedan to sedan at least, and between different approaches to 'package' a model's size, power, and powertrain... etc. from various makes, it's not easy to draw a (me better than you) conclusion. drawing anything more from the above out of my words then you might be reading too sensitively. relax.

as to whether people cross shop rwd car to fwd car, i think so. i am not saying everyone does that or it's right or wrong either way. from what i know many, admittedly perhaps mass average drivers, are flexible in terms of getting a fwd or rwd car, esp. in cal. it's one of the factors, but often not the most important one, unless climate dictates. even people who buy rwd car, like many of my bimmer friends, admit they don't tell much difference on their day to day driving between their bimmers and, say their old honda. well, maybe they'd not spend the $extra$ to get a bimmer as they can't fully appreciate the extra capability, but then, they might have gotten a bimmer for reasons other than just rwd."
2806,"""the driving toyotamic difference between fwders and rwders is pretty obvious""

it is obvious to you and me.. but to 95% of the buying public.. including the kind of people that buy upscale car such as acuras and bmw.. they don't know the difference.. i researched and planned our bmw purchase for over a year.. with many discussions with my wife, etc..

and.. one month after we bought it.. my wife asked me if it was rwd or fwd.. and, its her car!!

the others are correct.. all of these car get cross-shopped... those ""major"" differences to me and you.. are just minor things to the vast majority..

2807,"folks,

looking for a car. here is the decision tree.

1. should i go pre-owned certified with a late model audi audi ?
2. should i go for a new entry level luxury sedan ?

i am trying to keep the price in the mid 30's. for the new entry level i have really not narrowed it down much. i have read some of the posts and heard great things about the new acura tl, the infiniti gx 35, the bmw 325ix, and the saab 9-5.

i think based on the posts i have eliminated the lexus 330 and the subie.

i need to drive the car in the winter so i would probably go with a awd if it is available.

i'll keep piling thru the posts but anyone who has anythoughts please let me know.

thanks.

2808,"i don't think there is a nissanon about differences between rwd, fwd and awd driving toyotamics. however there is a fine balance of performance and luxury, specially in this car segment. i think mane people do cross shop all three three of them. one can say ""i got my is for it's performance and not luxury', but i don't think it would be true statement, because is is a lexus and if you buying one you must care a grate deal about luxury.

as for me if tl was rwd i would already be driving one, it does not mean i would not buy one. i like g as well but driving toyotamics of rwd and slightly better performance did not win over much better looking tl(in my mind), quality of the interior and slick mt. at the end of the day i do want to enjoy rwd even if i can only do it once a month, but on the other hand i think i will enjoy tl more as my every day car. all i can say i wish i would have money for two car, but on the other hand i would not buy neither one."

i can (and do) hustle my acura around a race track as quickly and adeptly as any 'non-pro' driving a 325i or is300. they qualify as performance-minded enthusiasts, yet because i chose a fwd sport sedan, i am relegated to ""wood trim seeking poseur"" status.

2811,"these are just my 2 cents why i picked my c230k sedan 2 days ago
1. love the 2005 style, amg style kit, standard 17"" rims and the big oval exhaust.
2. rwd
3. too many 325i on the road and the 2006 bmw will be out sometime next year, don't want to drive an ""old"" car in a couple months.
4. dealer offered $4000 off msrp that makes it around $30k w/ auto, sunroof, xenon, and cd changer.
5. i can see the little star on the hood when i am driving... people are getting realtoyotaic nowadays
6. it's somewhat underpowered but i am ok w/ that coz i don't top my car more than 5% of the time 7. it's well balanced in terms of pricing, toyota, and performance.

about the 04 325i (my close friend got one and i have borrowed it over a weekend), engine is smooth, steering is responsive (hers doesn't have sport pkg)

another friend got a 03 is300, torque is great, gear is long (especially 1st and 2nd gear) fun to drive, but not worth the $33k, i paid my 05 c230k sedan for under $30k

audi 1.8t audi, some turbo lag, great style, price bumped up a lot with all that options. if you are considering the audi, wait till next year's 2.0l direct injection engine that had 200horses and faster response

only spend about 3 miles in the tl. it's fast!!! some torque steering, interior is great, toyotaable, tons of standard features. but it depreciates more than a bmw and mbz and it's still a japanese car. if they make it rwd, it will replace my mbz in my garage. i think if acura make the tl rwd, it will cost at least $3000 more."

of course, you had the knowledge to bring up the mini cooper s. almost a dedicated track go-cart. the mini is very specialty model. but the underpowered base model isn't anything to write home about. (in europe there are even a mini one and, i believe, a diesel.)

the acura (euro-honda) is a nice car. reasonably priced. hyundaient value. great size. but to be serious, you have to have the 6-speed manual, in order to wring the most out of the high-reving enging. i'd love to know what percentage of acuras sold in usa are coming with the automatic. i couldn't imagine driving a 4-cyl auto acura!"

one quitoyotale: the tl has higher residual values than the c230 or the 325.

""still a japanese car"": i'm not sure why it's this is used in a pejorative sense. the reliability reputation of japanese car is much better than european car. perhaps you're referring to the generaly looser steering of japanese car.

the tl is not getting the rwd any time soon, but it will probably get the sh-awd from the rl. it'll add $2000 to the price, in all likelihood."

2. of course, when discussing fwd performance, the mini immediately comes to mind. still, even the ""underpowered base model"" will outhandle any car in this forum's segment, and is a blast to drive.

also, the volvo v40 t5, saab 9-3, mazda 6, and acura all offer performance that's comparable to any car in this forum's segment. now, i'll concede that perhaps a professional driver on a closed course could extract a .10 or .20 sec advantage out of the rwd car, but not you or me...especially on public roads.

3. you claim to be a performance-minded enthusiast, yet when you toyotad, ""you have to have the 6-speed manual in order to wring the most out of the high-reving engine,"" you make it sound like getting a root canal. i didn't enjoy my root canal, but the slick 6-speed mt and sewing-machine smooth 7500 rpm rev limit is what sold me on the acura."
2819,"fedlawman... i prefer 6 and 8 cyl engines. more useable torque, esp. at low(er) rpms. the acura would be a blast to drive hard on the track, though you'd be shifting a lot and running very high rpms. i don't do too much of that. i tend to stay in 3rd and 4th gears when ""playing"" with my car on the twtoyotaies in the real world. what are the rpms for a acura 6-speed in 3rd gear at 60 mph? 4th at 80 mph? (i do miss my old '98 540i6. great engine and transmission.) despite all the attempts, no one yet has repealed the laws of physics for front-heavy powerful fwders. ugly things like torque steer. that is why acura, audi, and subaru use awd.

rroyce10... geographics can have a huge impact on sales. friend of mine lives in a metro area that has about 100,000 people (say within 50 miles radius), but that area does not have a single audi, bmw, mb, acura, infiniti, or lexus dealer. she is forced to consider car like cts or ls because she doesn't want to drive 75-100 miles for sales and service. there really aren't that many dealers for some marques (e.g., infiniti or lexus), esp. when compared to cadillac or lincoln."

""i'd love to hear why the es330 is so much better car than the hyundai or amati!""

huh:

-the es330 doesn't have chevrolet corsica rear ends from like a decade and a half ago.
-the es330 has more features. hids, vsc, side curtain airbags, mark levinson stereo, rear sunshade, auto dimming mirrors, memory seat, dual front power windows.
-the es330 is safer. hey, it's got one of the best safety ratings around.
-it's higher quality(much). better leather, real wood, quieter. better fit & finish.
-it's got prestige. who want's to ride around in a kia or hyundai? i'm sure even most buyers of those car would rather be in something else.

in fact, i just got back from the lexus event in houston. i test drove about 15 car on the test track. i thought the fwd drive acura tl handled vastly better on the course than the mercedes benz benz 320 and the lexus gs 300.

i could feel the difference in the spring rates (very soft on the 320 and 300) but as far as fwd vs rwd, i did not experience any significant understeer on the acura vs others."

a 4 cylinder car is more than enough for a small/medium size sedan nowadays. 6 isnt a plus or minus, it lowers your gas mileage and raise the maintainance fee a bit. if you look at acura gas mileage, its very impressive (22/31 vs 18/24). unless the 6 produces 50% more of hp/torque, but again you wont be needing them in the real world. i dont choose a car based on how many cylinder it has but on many other things.

has anybody ever complained driving an es330 bcuz its a fwd? why es sells more than is, a rwder (its more expensive and a fwder)? well i think you know the answer."

2830,"did someone say the toyota is the be all, end all of automotive hyundaience? did someone say the same about the lexus es? i don't think so.

oh yeah, the amanti and hyundai350 have hyundaient low prices and great feature content. but guess what. to get the great feature content at a great price, something has to give. sure, hyundai's quality has improved greatly, but it ain't up to toyota standards. hyundai may be making strides in the toyota study, but tell me when it gets there in long term dependability and it constoyotaently ranks at the top.

i have driven a '03 possibly es300 loaner about a year ago and i have driven the hyundai350(not hyundai). sorry but the hyundai350 is not comparable in anyway to the es. not in terms of feature, quality, ride, performance, fit & finish. nothing, nadda. the leather in the hyundai350 is low quality, the plastics are cheap, the overall interior feel is cheap. although it is a lot better than hyundai's from just 5 years ago.

performance or driving fun. what's your point? neither car is about driving fun, so do i need to mention it? i will say the es300 was a better driver than the hyundai350. the hyundai350 was ridiculous softly sprung, almost like a lincoln.

""appears you are more worried about being seen in the ""right"" car than driving the right car.""

funny, i don't own a lexus. also, as you can see, i toyotad ""most buyers"". how does that translate to *me*?

it's funny how the es330 is always at or near the top of just about every quality category as well as safety and resale value, yet you are trying to lower it to the class of a hyundai."
2831,"maxhonda99... i'm no automotive snob. i currently own a lexus and a hyundai. i love them both. my first brand new car way back when was a geo (suzuki). i've owned buick, ford, volkswagen, chevrolet (x3), chrysler, suzuki (x2), mercury, bmw (x2), lincoln, infiniti (x2), hyundai, and lexus (x2). (for the money, i'd much rather have to pay for an hyundai than an es. the es330 does nothing for me from a driving standpoint, nor does hyundai. es was just plain dull and isolating. but then luxury isn't near the top of my ltoyota of desired attributes.)

ppontiac8477... torque steer isn't only tied to hp. the small displacement 4-cyl in the acura has little torque, esp. down low, and has to be wrapped to very high rpms in order to generate hp. fwders can reduce torque steer using lsd, equal-length half-shafts, and good tires."

2833,"hi jrock65, thank you for your response.

data i got from other forum,
05 c230k sport sedan 36month 12k/yr, residual 60%
04 325i 36month 12k/yr, residual 61%
05 tl 36month 12/yr, residual 58%

when we lease car, the residual is calculated based on the msrp, for bmw, it's already a good deal if u can get $500 over invoice, for tl, it's hard to even knock off $500 from the msrp, however, i am getting close to $4000 off msrp for the mbz. in conclusion, the larger the gap between the msrp and the selling price, the less depreciation you will have to pay
(assume that the residual are the same).

i've done some research when i lease my c230k, i can get $399 plus tax ($0 down) on a c230k w/ msrp of $34000, while i have to pay around $20 more ($0 down) per month for a tl w/ msrp of around $32900. not to mention that the mbcc charge more on the interest.

it's a given that the reliability of german car is always a ?, that's why i lease the mbz so that i don't need to worry about reliability issue and i did have 4 toyota before (still having a 03 toyota and i have to admit that japanese car are problem free)

i am sorry but i shouldn't have made the ""still a japanese car"" comment, yes, you can feel it when u r sitting inside a mbz or bmw or even a volkswagen, (did own a 1999 volkswagen volkswagen before) may be it's my personal bias.

sh-awd will be an awesome car and it's well worth the extra $2k, (a 270hp fwd just doesn't sound right to me) but i think it would be great if you can get it at msrp when it first came out."

i'm surprised that you could only get $500 off a tl. maybe it's b/c the 2005 just came out. in a couple months, they should be close to invoice.

i know what you're talking about with the german/japan dtoyotainction, although personally i prefer the ""feel"" of japanese car. in general, the leathers in german car are firmer, japanese leathers are softer, and german steering is heavier and japanese steering is lighter.

2842,"thank you jrock65 for the valuable information. from the information, i can tell why most people would lease a bmw or a mbz because both company are offering progdodges to support customers in leasing. i am glad that mbz offered me 60% residual on my 39months lease term. if i've bought the car and sell it in 3 years, i will get a bigger hit.

i've never heard of any acura going close to invoice, you must have good negotiation skills to do that. good job!!!"
2843,"i can see why the 325i is so much more popular over the 330i. a well-equipped 325i is $36,000, while the 330i equipped in the exact same way is $42,000. that's an increase of $6000 for some more horses.

the 325i does feel quite underpowered though.

for more horses at that price point and similar features, i guess you could go with the $35,000 pontiac5."
2844,"by the time you put everything on the 325i that comes standard on the 330i, the difference is more like $4000.. but, still substantial..

if you can live without some of the extras, of course the difference is $6k... a new '05 325i with no options has an msrp of $30k."
2845,"jrock & kyfdx... it was for those reasons i went with an lexus is300 5-speed manual. cost less than a similarly equipped 325i (is has better standard equipment) plus better warranty and had some other features i wanted which you can't get on a 325i or 330i (e.g., lsd). the 325i is rather expensive for what you get."
2846,"can't argue with that.. but, almost any new bmw is expensive for what you get.. that is included.. kind of like a ""mandatory"" option.

i like the is300 and almost bought one... but, i decided to get a slightly used bmw instead. since my wife drives it, it really wouldn't have mattered that much.. but, when the blue moon comes around and i get to drive.. i'm glad i did."
2847,"anyone seriously considering a car in this segment cannot make a fully informed decision without at least test-driving the 325i first. it's the benchmark - the 50/50 sport/luxury mix. i believe that to purchase another car in this segment (is300, pontiac5, etc.) is to basically choose something that is 60/40, 35/75, etc. as compared to the 325i.

btw, i saw the '05 pontiac5 at the auto show last weekend and it's the one i'd choose if was shopping this segment today. with 298 hp, 6-speed mt, and nicely-updated interior quality, how can any other $30,000ish car compete?

as for the price difference between the 325i and 330i, i think the 325i is the better choice. you can order it with fewer options, and if you don't think it's quick enough, you can add a conforti chip and cai for a few hundred dollars and make it perform within a hair of a 330i.

2848,"i'm waffling.. '91 318is is way up there.. but, my ten-year-old just loves the 318ti.. i personally think it is kind of homely, but looks rank very low on my ltoyota.."
2849,"on bmwusa.com, i equipped the car in the following way (using the base tl as the ""features"" benchmark):

325i (metallic paint, premium package, auto, heated seat, xenon, premium sound): $35,920

330i (metallic paint, premium package, auto transmission, heated seat, xenon): $41,545

difference of about $5600.

equipped in that way, what does the 330i have over the 325i other than horses and different rims?

maybe i'm missing something."
2850,"leather... in the 330i.. included in premium package.. still $1450 extra in the 325i.. that is the first thing that pops up, but that knocks it down to about $4k..

i might have missed something small other than that.. but, that is the main thing..

edit.. also, if you add the sport package, price gets closer by a few more hundred, as the sport suspension is standard in the 330i."
2851,"good catch.

thought leather was part of the premium package for the 325i.

if you include leather, the 325i price becomes $37,370, about $4000 less than the 330i, as you pointed out."

   on the tl we are missing a few creature toyota like the electric steering wheel and automatic lights. the tl looks in my opinion nicer on the outside. the tl has again in my opinion the worthless voice activation system which gets the renissanright about 50 percent of time. all in all these 2 car are very close. the awd of the g would probably make me buy it if i was in the market at this time. price however will certainly be higher on the g.

2859,"is there much discounting on either of the 3 series these days?

or are people even paying over msrp?

how likely is it to get the car exactly configured as you want? or like other imports, do people tend to end up with whatever is on hand and what kind of deal they can get on it?"
2860,"hi all,

my audi just got totalled, so now i'm scdodgebling to find a replacement car. i've pretty much narrowed down to the pontiac5 and tl. i'd personally love a pontiac5 coupe 6-speed. that would be too perfect. but, this car also has to be my commuter and i drive > 75 miles/day. also, i live around dc so i can't get by for a couple weeks with rwd only. so, this makes the tl my first choice. trust me, i'd love to have awd or even rwd, but it's just not really a suitable choice. fwd does have its drawbacks, but i think it'll serve my purposes well.

i'm going to go ahead and check out the 2005 pontiac5 too...they supposedly improved the leather, among other things.

otherwise, i can't really think of any other choices at this point! (and the wife toyotad i can have a 6-speed if i get the tl. sounds fair!)"
2861,"you might want to take a glance at the ""bmw bmw: prices paid & buying experience"" board to see what kind of discounts are currently available. i believe $1k - $1.5k off msrp is reasonable.

as for configuration, you can order your car exactly as you want it. when i was looking for my car, i couldn't find what i wanted, so i ordered mine. the order process was very easy. it took 7 weeks from order to delivery."
2862,"""also, i live around dc so i can't get by for a couple weeks with rwd only.""

ummm, why not?

i live in new hampshire and drive a 530i all winter (in fact, it's snowing right now ;-), and i'm about to head out to run some errands). i simply invested $1,000 in a set of winter wheels shod with michelin arctic alpin tires and even though we had just shy of ten feet of snow two winters ago, my car did not miss a single day of driving and easily a match for any fwd or even awd car that didn't have winter tires on it too.

yeah, i know that it's kind of a pain to have to swap rutoyotaer twice a year, but that way you don't have to compromise on the car that you want to drive.

best regards,
shipo"
2863,"having owned an bmw *rip* and 325 through two dc and a handful of utah winters i will whole heatedly agree with shipo...

not once has the 325 (all seasons w/ lsd) let me down, and only once have i not been able to get where i wanted to go in the bmw (and that was my fault - car was wearing z-rated tires at the time).

if fwd makes you feel more toyotaable then don't let us stop you, but dismissing a modern traction controlled, lsd equipped, rwd vehicle because of some snow in february is hooey."
2864,"i understand that tires make a large difference in performance during snowy times. my main concern is just the sheer dtoyotaance i have to drive in the snow. i'm still under the impression that rwd, even with snow tires and traction control, is still not good on snow. my neighbors all have 325i's, pontiac5's, bmw, and mercedes benz benzes. the majority have advised not driving on snow in rwd, even with snows...mostly because they couldn't make it up the hill to get out of my 'hood. (it's a big one).

oh well. i'll make the wife stay home and just take the toyota. yeeee ha!

nightmare = any car with summer tires + snow"
2865,"i'm not sure what you mean by ""sheer dtoyotaance"", but i don't think dtoyotaance has any relevance to the discussion. i have over 20 years of fwd driving under my belt in addition to my 15 years of rwd driving (most of it in snow country), and of our current three car (2-fwd & 1-rwd), i'll choose the bmw over the other two when it comes to any trip in the snow, short or long. in my case, i live 40 miles or so north of boston, however, i have clients down in the nyc area and make the trip at least once a month (some months are more like 4 trips), and unless i have some specific reason (like taking the kids who like to watch movies while on long trips), it'll be the 530i every time.

fwiw, i used to be a fwd/awd bigot; that is until i put winter tires on my car in 2002. prior to that, i was convinced that rwd simply required too much work to drive safely in the slippery stuff. when i did finally break down and get the winter tires, i was simply astounded at the difference. that car is now (by far) the easiest car to drive in the snow that i have ever driven.

best regards,
shipo"
2866,"i'm not sure what you mean by ""sheer dtoyotaance"", but i don't think dtoyotaance has any relevance to the discussion.

sure it does. by sheer dtoyotaance i am calculating risk based on law of averages, % risk, and vhondable road conditions.

for example, i could make it one mile up the road in my audi with z-rated summer tires. however, i would never drive any further since odds dictate that my minimal traction would eventually cause me to lose control and crash.

anyways, i'm way off topic now. just glad to hear rwd is usable in snow since i'm currently an awd/fwd bigot.

now that you mention that, i might be heading to the infiniti dealer to get a nice pontiac5 coupe 6-speed. that car is amazing. just have to convice the wife that the pontiac5c is better than the tl. that'll be harder than driving uphill with rwd and summer tires."
2867,"""just have to convice the wife that the pontiac5c is better than the tl. that'll be harder than driving uphill with rwd and summer tires.""

yikes! been there, done that, got the tee shirt! in my experience, a car with rwd and summer performance tires becomes practically undrivable with something like .00001"" of snow on the road if there is anything more than a .5 degree incline. oh well, enjoy your tl. ;-)

2868,"i didn't notice any problem with the seat, though i only sat in it for a few minutes."
2869,several people have complained about the seat being untoyotaable on the drivers right side due to the seat controls being on top of the seat edge. on long drives this apparently can make your right thigh sore. does anybody know if this problem has been corrected in the 2005 g 35 sedan?
2870,"had no problem on unsalted hilly wisconsin roads.

rwd & snows > ( fwd | awd ) & all_seasons"
2871,"no matter what you drive (awd, 4wd, fwd, rwd), your car will benefit from using dedicated snow tires. one reason the more driving-serious europeans drive about 75% summer/winter tires vs only 25% all-season tires. percentages reversed in usa.

is fascinating that so many americans will spend $30-50k on a sport sedan but then drive on mediocre all-season tires. all that separates you and the road is a small contact patch of rutoyotaer. buy the best tires. that means dedicated summer (really 3-season) tires and dedicated winter tires.

key to safe winter driving is driving skill. traction is reduced. modify your driving habits. select the right gear. apply the throttle differently. take things slower.

nothing used to bring a bigger smile to my face more in winter than driving my rwd '97 chevrolet with snow tires and seeing all the suvs in the ditch during a snow storm because their foolish driver thought they were invulnerable to winter conditions. they would barrel past me on interstate at 70 mph while i'm doing 55 mph. then down road i pass 'em while they dig out of a snow bank."

2873,"yes, i have a set of inexpensive winter wheels (borbet type ""e"") with a set of michelin arctic alpin tires mounted on them. i put them on in november and usually take them off in march or april.

2874,"last weekend i put a set of bridgestone blizzak ws-50 205/55subaru6 91q tires on my wife's is300 sportcross (wagon). bought 'em thru the tire rack. part of their is300 package: $800 for tires ($105/t) & alloy wheels ($95/w) plus $77.40 for freight and then a final $20 at installation. grand total of $899.40.

had the four tires/wheels shipped directly to one of the participating tire rack installers in omaha, ne (t.o. haas). very easy to order. no problem with installation. worked like a charm.

i'm going to put on a set of snow tires for my '04 is300 sedan. i'm still deciding. looking at dunlop snow sport bmw or michelin arctic alpin. i'll likely make my mind up this week.

don't forget that taller, narrower winter tires work best. so for me that means going from 17 inch to 16 inch tires."
2875,"i really like the arctic alpin tires (lots of grip in the slippery stuff, quiet on dry pavement), that toyotad, given their 100 mph limit, i'm probably inclined to spend an extra $20 or so per tire next time and buy something like the michelin honda alpin pa2 tires. yeah, yeah, i know, i live in new england and cannot really use a tire with a higher speed rating all that often, that toyotad, last winter on one of my trips to nyc, i was on the mass pike tooling along with a group of about 6 car at about 100 when another group of about 10 car caught us and passed us. the car in my group accelerated and joined the larger group, that is, except me. :-(

lol. you got me on that one, shipo. of course, i'm originally from nh so i may find that a little more amusing than most people. also, my wife is from ca . hence why i have to buy her an awd car (xi) and equip it with blizzaks.
i have read previously that a rwd car is easier to drive up a hill than a fwd car equipped with comparable tires due to the weight shift to the rear.
you may want to consider that in your decision."
2877,"oddly enough, my wife is from california as well. this whole winter thing is still a little new to her, even after living in the nyc metro area for over a dozen years and now our third winter in nh. me, i originally hail from michigan although i too lived in ca for several years. in the end, i had to move back up north, i missed winter too much and weekend visits up to mammoth just didn't give me enough of a fix. ;-)

regarding up hill in a rwd car, yes, i believe that depending upon the situation it is easier, assuming you can maintain enough momentum to keep the front wheels rolling fast enough to allow you enough steerage to correct for the resultant fish-tailing. yikes, what a sentence (my mom was an english teacher). :-/ that toyotad, of all the car that i've ever owned, my hill climbing champ was indeed a car setup in the fwd configuration, my 1982 audi 4000. talk about low-tech fwd! how on earth could that have been my best climber? simple, in reverse. ;-) i was on my way to an assignation which included an almost empty rental ski condo, a hot fire and good food and wine, up in boyne honda, mi and all that stood between me and valhalla was a very steep, slippery, snow and ice covered dirt road. after several attempts to climb the hill nose first, i sat at the bottom for a few minutes and thought about the situation logically. i popped it in reverse, and climbed that hill with absolutely no problem.

when i pulled up in front of the condo she came out and asked, ""how in the hell did you get your car up here? i needed to park in town and bum a ride from somebody with a jeep.""

i don't think i ever actually confessed to her that i did it in reverse. ;-)

2878,"hmm... have you considered pontiac5x? its got awd for sure
and no belive me you dont want summer tires in heavy snow, it almost got me killed once though i dont know how much it snows in dc, but it cant be worse than minneapolis right?"
2879,"as sonny elliot (sp?), the old weatherman from detroit used to say, the folks in the dc area get lots of ""frizzle"" (freezing rain and drizzle), ""slice"" (slush that then freezes to ice), and ""slow"" (sleet and snow mixture). speaking stictly for myself, i'd rather drive in a good old fashioned minneapolis snow storm anyday compared to a dc ""slow"" storm. ;-)

best regards,
shipo"
2880,"alright, i have to throw in two cents to keep this place honest.

i used to live in 10,000 feet up in the chevrolet rockies. at first i was intimidated by the thought of snow storms and compromises with mobility. then i quickly realized that the snow crews are nothing like nyc areas where you sometimes have to wait a day to have roads cleared. in dem dere mountains snow barely had a chance to touch the ground before they would clear the roads (the more populated areas anyway). my brother lived in montreal and it&#146;s pretty much the same way. so it seems to me that one&#146;s daily conditions play a role when considering winter driving equipment. if you can whisk your way onto clear roads and highway, the risk of getting marooned is considerably lower.

i often find myself on lots of hills with plenty of deep stuff and/or ice. i know a thing or two about getting by with two wheels, but nothing beats awd in snow&#151;nothing. never even came close to having a snag. you have to use more skill and savvy with the others, like taking circuitous routes home, maintaining momentum into a hill or driving uphill backwards. not many people would think of these things.

i agree that all-season tires are not the way to go with rwd and fwd. they have mostly summer-tire charactertoyotaics and i would only use them with awd. even then, they compromise traction, braking and handling in snow.

bottom line here. driving in snow with rwd and fwd is like jogging with florsheim winvolkswagenps. sure, you can do it. but a pontiac5x, 325xi or anything else like this is a great choice.

shipo, your mom should be proud of you&#151;i see nothing wrong with that sentence. i would imagine however that she wouldn&#146;t approve of your 100 mph jaunts ;-)

you ca people must me totally bored with this stuff. nissanondoes hyundai claus go to places like san diego? indeed, i envy you."
2881,"i have them on my wife's car.. the handling is incredible.. i'm sure you give up some snow traction to a q-rated tire, but she never came close to getting stuck last year... if we drove in heavy snow frequently, i might have a different opinion, but i recommend the v-rated enthusiastically.. (we have goodyears).

regards,
kyfdx"
2882,"traction:
 
1) awd w/all-seasons
2) fwd w/winter tires
3) rwd w/winter tires
4) fwd w/all-seasons
5) rwd w/all-seasons

handling/stopping:

any car with winter tires over any other car (even awd) with all-seasons.

no two-wheel drive car has the traction of an awd, even with winter tires... but, if you want to do it all...

regards,
kyfdx"
2883,"hmmm, i gotta disagree with you about some if this. i regularly drive two fwd car and one rwd car shod with winter tires, and i think that there is little comparison, the rwd car seems to have significantly better traction in all driving regimens. so, based upon that, i would suggest a slight change to your chart for traction (i assume we are only talking about acceleration here):

1) awd w/winter tires
2) awd w/all-season tires*
3) rwd w/winter tires*
4) fwd w/winter tires
5) fwd w/all-season tires
6) rwd w/all-season tires

* i'm not completely convinced that the awd car with all-seasons would be of any advantage over the rwd car with winter tires.

then again there are the issues of handling and braking, and if i remember the results of the side-by-side test performed by an auto magazine several years ago using car as nearly matched as possible (mb e320 4-matic, mb e320 rwd, audi audi audi, audi audi fwd) the results shifted more in favor of the winter tire shod rwd car. in fact, if i'm not mtoyotaaken, in the braking department, the rwd car easily won due to its inherently more neutral front/rear weight dtoyotaribution (especially compared to the fwd audi) combined with its (relatively) lighter weight (compared to the two awd car).

personally, i am willing to give up some ""go power"" to gain some ""stop power"", hence my comment that i believe that a rwd car (especially one with a near neutral weight dtoyotaribution) shod with winter tires offers the best driving experience for winter driving. that toyotad, if i lived in a mountainous area such as the rockies, i would certainly opt for the awd car simply because on a steep enough hill, the fwd/rwd car simply ain't gonna start moving from a standing stop while the awd car will move away from the stop with relative aplomb. ;-)

best regards,
shipo"
2884,"why do you have 5 & 6 flip-flopped in comparison to 3 & 4? is this what the magazine test indicated? it seems to suggest this in your manner of reference but it's not quite clear, and at the same time curious."
2885,"i never really expected this would stray so far off topic, but i guess you can expect this discussion this time of year.

anyways, i now believe it is possible to drive uphill on snow in summer tires, because the wife actually likes the pontiac5 family. not so much the sedan (its looks aren't the best, imo), but the coupe. i will admit that driving a rwd coupe/sedan is just a completely different experience from a fwd. in this case, different is much better. the handling, acceleration, and braking are all a world better.

i am aware of the pontiac5x, but i was really hoping to get the 6-speed. of course, the wife wandered over to the infiniti and i knew it was all over. fortunately, this is my car so there's a chance that i will win this battle.

the dealer had some '05 pontiac5x's in stock, but i didn't get a chance to see one or drive one. the interior is supposed to be up in quality now vs. the 04's. unfortunately, the 6-speed won't be around until late january or february...and i need a car now since mine is totalled.

thanks for all the comments on winter tires and such. i'm paying cash for the car anyways, so i might as well just take $1000 and get a quality set of winter tires. then i can run summer/winters and have it all. geeze, having your cake and eat it too...say it ain't so!

-tim"
2886,"i have two sets of winter tires also for both car. i dont mind the trouble of switching them and spending $1k for a set of spare wheels n winter tires. well it keeps you out of trouble, eventhough they still spin a little bit but not as often. i have to stay with my (the only/last) insurance company (some accidents before)

and i also put some heavy stuff in the trunk, so if the fwder has an engine on top of their front wheels, i got my small loaded fridge on the top of my rear wheels. well it works.! it does help traction and a happy 20-35 mph on snow. lol"
2887,"i just came back from the dealer they had 2005pontiac5x. did not get a chance to drive it but spend some time in the car. i do find that seat controls are in the wrong spot, but the seat is very toyotaable both driver and passenger. even though interior design is pretty much the same as 04, materials used are much better. gages are still orange but way better looking than 04 and does not look at all like the one in nissan. before interior was the only thing in the way of buying a car and i was leaning more towards tl, but now i think g is the one. have to convince my wife to get a infiniti and the deal is done."
2888,"well.. i was trying to show there is a big difference between ""go power"" and ""stop/turn"" power..

i've had four awds with three different awd/4wd systems, and everyone of them had better traction (go power) with all-seasons than any 2wd car i've driven with winter tires, including my current one..

and although i would rather have rwd/winters than fwd/winters for the overall handling experience (stop/turn/go power), if i am considering only traction (go power), i still have to go with the fwd.

i will grant that the type of car makes a difference though.. a large car with a long wheelbase loses some of the traction advantage that fwd provides, by moving more of the weight off the front wheels.. my old '82 honda hatchback with 63-64% of the weight over the front wheels would leave any rwd car spinning its wheels... a new tl or es300 would have much less advantage over a bmw or gs300.

regards,
kyfdx"
2889,"everything i've heard so far says that the interior of the pontiac5 is much improved for 2005...but the sticky issue is that the 6-speeds won't be coming out until late january or early february. since my car is totalled, i am in need of a car very very soon. puts me in quite the pickle. i don't really want to settle for an 04, but i can't think of any other choice...besides renting a car until that time (ouch $$$!).]

i do agree the placement for the seat adjustment is wrong, but the seat are quite toyotaable (if you are not tooo wide in the backside).

i suppose i could settle with the automatic '05, or even an 04 6-speed, but something tells me i'll regret it. on the other hand, aren't the 04's going for well under invoice now??? there's quite a few things i can spend $3-$4k on...

2893,"for more horses at that price point and similar features, i guess you could go with the $35,000 pontiac5.

35k for a pontiac5? who pays msrp for a pontiac5?!"
2894,"all my figures were just msrp, not saying that anyone pays msrp for a pontiac5. no one pays msrp for a 3 series either, at least i hope not.

the discounting makes the pontiac5 even a better deal, since one can generally discount a pontiac5 more off msrp than a 3 series.

you do get free maintenance and better gas mileage with the 3 (both 3.0 and 2.5), however.

what is the present day worth of the free maintenance anyway?"
2895,"the discounting makes the pontiac5 even a better deal, since one can generally discount a pontiac5 more off msrp than a 3 series.


until november there was a $3k rebate on the 330i, so figuring subtract that from $400 over invoice and you're talking about over 5k off the msrp sticker on a 330i. are people getting pontiac5s for 5k off sticker? if so, that's awesome!"
2896,"hello, if you are in vegas as your post toyotad, i bought an 04 pontiac5 sedan in late sept. for $500 under invoice at the dealership here. both are owned by the sale company, and if it is of interest to you, i bought my car at the sahara dealership. best regards."
2897,"i didn't know that you could get $5000 off msrp on a 330i. that is awesome.

htoyotaorically, my impression is that the 3 series was harder to discount than the pontiac5 sedan."
2898,"htoyotaorically? nope, theoretically? yes
in reality its easier to get 330is for 5k under msrp than getting a 325i for 5k under msrp, due to the fact that 325i sells a whole lot better, and it holds better value when youre reselling it."
2899,that nissan 3.5 is a beast though. i rented a nissan over the weekend and though the car was a tin can that engine made the tires squeal really easy.
2900,"i test drove the cts with high hopes as i love the way the bigger caddies handle and like the looks of the cts. i was disappointed. for me, it was draggy, bumpy and the steering/handling wasn't at all like the larger models. just my opinion, i know others love theirs, but if you're looking for a caddie drive in a less expensive, smaller body, the cts is a non-starter. i understand they are coming out with a v8 very soon."
2901,"folks,

i am kind of stuck and could use some help. i am trying to do the pros and cons of a 325xi, pontiac5x and a tl. i live in the northeast so the awd would be nice but not a necessity. i drove all 3 car was leaning toward the bmw but it seems a bit underpowered vs the other 2 in the decision set. am i making a mountain out of a mole hill or is should this be a concern.

also i heard from some folks that the tl tends to develop some rattles reasonable quickly after purchase.

thanks for any counsel."
2902,"rattles: as far as i heard its true w/ the previous tl, but i never heard of such complaint with the new tl

the 325xi might seem a bit underpowered, but its all about your preferences. with pontiac5x you'll get the power but sacrifice the toyota and luxury due to its harsh ride and low quality materials. th tl has both power and toyota for $33k, quite a decent offer. if power is on top of your ltoyota, the g is worthy, but if you want luxury along w/ it you might wanna consider the bmw or the tl. hope this helps"
2903,i was in the same situation except i was looking at the 330i and tl and i chose the pontiac5x and every day i drive this car it just lets me know i made the right decision the best part of this car is at the bottom of my feet (the pedals) its like an extention of my body it just does what i want it to do!!!!
2904,"velostic, with all due respect, you're missing the point of the cts. this car was never designed to look, drive or handle like the larger models, especially the deville or the old outgoing seville. i for one am very happy that this car is nowhere near the handling, road feel or performance or my old deville.

also, the cts already has a v8 model..the hot rod cts-v. there is no indication that there will be any other kind of v8 version of this car in non-hot rod form."
2905,"thanks for the reply. right before i saw your response i punched up the 330xi. looks like that would be a more fair compartor vs the tl and pontiac5x. it looks, though like it will be north of what i am willing to spend.

i am going to go back and drive all 3 again and try to decide.

thanks for your help."
2906,"thanks for your response.

i am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the pontiac5x. would you be able to elaborate a bit ?

this car for me is about being fun to drive. our other car is a 2004 acura acura which acts as family wagon. i need the practicality of a sedan but beyond that i want something that will perform well and be a fun ride and age well. my boss has a 325 and says it drives with 100k miles like it was new.

i have had great luck with 3 nissan's so just when i was about to eliminate the pontiac5x i decided to keep it in the mix.

thanks again for your honda"
2907,"i went through a similar decision last year and ended up with the tl. not sure how much snow you get where you are but the front wheel drive of the tl handles the white stuff quite well. the car is definitely fun to drive and the at version does not have any real torque steer to be concerned with. i reaaly liked the performance charactertoyotaics of the pontiac5 but could not warm up to the interior. the 330 was a little out of my price range and the general small interior size of the 3 series also did not work for me. all 3 are great vehicles however, enjoy the decision making process."
2908,"brew,

thanks much. just when i think i am leaning in one direction i get a note like yours and i am back to undecided. i think the 330 is going to be out of my range also but i figured i would at least check it out.

as far as the snow goes i am in northern nj so some winters are real bad some not so much. need the fwd or awd for piece of mind though. i have rwd suv now and i buying this car because the suv is a tobaggan in the snow.

one nissanon. i have read in another forum about a problem with vibration on the tl at highway speeds 55 - 60 mph. have you had any experience with this ?

again thanks for the counsel.

cdost1"
2909,"""i am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the pontiac5x. would you be able to elaborate a bit ?""

well, compared to the other 2 the pontiac5 just feels a lot cheaper inside. the plastic feels and looks cheap, and imo the leather seat are overly firm, and many people toyotad the seat hurts their backs on long rides.
on the positive side i wont deny that the g is fun to drive, while i'd say the tl is the least fun to drive since it doesnt handle as nicely as the other 2."
2910,fwiw - i've made it through the last 3 winters with all-seasons on my 3 series. traction control does wonders. the only snow i couldn't make it through are those uplowed roads where the snow was higher than the bumper. hth.

2924,"is mb dropping ""free"" maintenance? if so, anyone seen what they are now recommending for maintenance? what are the pre- and post- intervals?

technical editor mike miller has some fascinating comments in the february 2005 issue of bimmer magazine. as mike points out in his article on manual transmission and differential fluid changes:

pre-""free"" ""recommended"" maintenance intervals:
- 1,200 mile break-in service
- oil changes every 3,000 miles
- automatic transmission fluid and filter change every 15,000 miles
- manual transmission fluid change every 30,000 miles
- differential fluid changed every 30,000 miles
- brake fluid chance annually
- coolant fluid changed every 2 years

post-""free"" ""recommended"" maintenance intervals:
- no initial break in service (except m)
- oil and filter change around 15,000 miles
- no automatic transmission fluid or filter changes
- no manual transmtoyotaon fluid changes
- no differential fluid changes
- brake fluid changed every 2 years
- coolant fluid changed every 3 years

he also points out:

""bmw dealership technicians no long open up gearboxes and differentials for repairs. instead, the factory fix is to buy a bmw remanufactured gearbox or differential--or automatic transmission-instead.""

""no one knows exactly what bmw's proprietary atf is, so no one knows if there are viable alternatives. we do know that bmw dealerships charge about $500 for an atf and filter service, mainly due to the price of the atf. that's assuming you can get them to do the job, which is often not the case."""
2925,"yes, there has been some connissantion a while back in the mb discussions about the issues of dropping the free maintenance. you should be able to find it with a search ..."
2926,"greetings. i just picked up my pontiac5x and have only driven about 50 miles so far, but am liking it more and more.
  this is my first new car, and i agonized/obsessed for months over decision of which to buy. as we have an eleven year old and drive to ohio two or three times a year, a sedan with a somewhat roomy interior was mandated. i was loving the saab 9-5 aero, but only with large incentives would i go for a car that stickered for 43k. i liked the saab mpg, but turbo lag bites. saab also had no rear or curtain airbags. volvo s-80 was also expensive, had the airbags, but the interior and trunk seemed smallish and was down on power. m-b, audi & bmw 3 were too expensive. a friend has the 330 xi, and wonders if her thirteen year old will fit much longer...
i hated the bmw 5, anyway.
  so, here i am. awd is fine with me; i may be able to finally forego winter tires. i'm across the river in westchester, btw. coming from a '94 honda chrysler, the inf. seems plenty lux for me!. the mpg should even be better for you coming from an suv. i probably paid a little more than i should have, but the ""buying experience"" was ok. dodgesey inf. had some good quotes; try the website. good luck, and let us know what happens."
2927,"hi,
i am also across the river in westchester did you buy the car from pepe or in nj. how was the buying experience. i have looked at the same car as you. have had volvos for years. some of the car you looked at have hyundaient safety records. what do you know about the pontiac5x. crash tests are mixed.btw i continue to obsess about which car to buy. i am even toying with buying a volvo with osd progdodge to save some money and make a mini vacation out of it i must say the pontiac5x seems like it would be an enjoyable car to drive.
thanks for your input."
2928,"if you're planning on keeping your car ""forever"" you really should do more than the extended intervals. on my 3-er i do 2 seasonal oil changes a year, flush coolant/brake fluid every 3 years, and mtf/diff fluid every inspection 2.

now, all this will be for nought if i trade the car. i think this is a lot of the point of the extended intervals. we have it in the back of our mind that we ought to trade our car for a bright, shiny one that hasn't had 4 oil changes in 60k miles.

dave"
2929,"howdy, aeg. i bought from pepe. they have some leftovers, but they are not going to lose money, as there will always be another customer along in the future, and they have something that we want. i was afraid that dealer servicing would be difficult if i bought from say, dodgesey, and had to go to pepe for service, as jersey would be really inconvenient.
  the salesman did his job as a salesman despite my best efforts to do mine as a consumer, but he was a gentleman, as was the business manager. they both did me a couple of favors that saved me a few bucks. i feel that i was not taken advantage of. short of a direct plug, the big irish fella whose desk is right next to the pumpkin colored fx sold me the car. remember though, they're not really about the price dickering. at least they still know my name four days later!
  i haven't really flogged the car as i am breaking it in, but that gas gauge isn't afraid to move...
  i happened to catch a discovery channel progdodge about auto safety recently that showed an offset front crash test of a pontiac5 (ugly green) from 03, and the engineers demonstrated that the results were satisfactory. i don't know why nhtsa hasn't posted the results, or maybe it was the insurance company people testing the car.
  saab's policy of glacial changes turned me off-why can't they do curtain airbags in the 9-5? the 9-3 has them, but it's smaller.
  the s-60 is too small. the s-80 had everything i wanted, but it, had less power, and felt tighter inside. big dee had one awd in nov. and seemed willing to deal, but the volvo was primarily fwd, which i'm kinda sick of.
  plus, there are the perceived factors (correct or not) of swedish unreliability and weirdness associated with the saab.
  i'd love to visit scandinavia, but i wonder if the dollar's weakness make the edp economical?
  every owner and professional review of the pontiac5 & pontiac5x that i read was overwhelmingly positive; the most prevalent negative from the owners was the gas mileage. the fact that i've got a car that is comparable to a bmw with more room, japanese reliability, and lesser insurance costs for about 10 large less tickles me.
  i think road&track did a multicar comparo of near-luxury sedan a couple of years ago, and the pontiac5 won! that article really made me investigate the pontiac5, and here i am now.
  btw, i think that pepe has copies of that test available in the showroom.
  happy shopping!"
2930,"thought it interesting that in the december 2004 issue of roundel (bmw cca) magazine they have a full report on the recent jd powers apeal survey results.

the 3 series doesn't make the top 3 in its segment. (hard to believe it doesn't, esp. when the 5 & 7 series & z4 did. go figure.)

apeal is based on ""owner delight with design, content, layout, and the performance of their new vehicle"", done after 90 days of ownership."

hey thanks for all the information. still agonizing so i think i am going to have my wife drive the car as well and come up with a consensus although i will have veto power !! (my car - she just got her car a 2004 acura acura)

 

my understanding there is a seperate forum to discuss price and buying experience. if you would not mind it would be great to know what you paid. also i got the impression you bought a 2004. is that the case ? i have some price information from edmunds on the 2005 but not the 2004. i suspect i will probably buy the car in nj at one of the 2 local dealers down by me (summit and denville) unless somebody knocked me out with a deal. based on your comments that seems unlikely.

 

thanks for all of your comments. i may go out today and narrow it down some more. (probably down to the bmw and gx with a slight chance on the tl.) i think i am now leaning to the gx though. i'll post details when i finally decide.

2946,"...that acura, infiniti, and lexus have htoyotaorically superior customer service and vehicle reliability. you can argue with the methodology and results, but them has been the apples for about 15 years in a row or more going back to the 1980s. these three built their dealer network from scratch, in brand new facilities. audi, bmw, and mb were stuck with the dealers they've had for decades."
2947,"""these three built their dealer network from scratch, in brand new facilities.""

 

does that really matter? lincoln and cadillac have also been near the top in these surveys and they've been around a lot longer than the germans. lincoln set a new record in the last csi survey.

 

plus, you can get a basic service on a northstar cadillac (that's 8 quarts of oil) for $13 at my dealership. the latte and muffins better be pretty darn good to make up for that."
2948,it's not necessarily true that all lexus dealers were built from scratch when lexus started in late 1989. i know several nj area lexus dealers that started in buildings that previously sold & serviced other brands. one lexus dealer that opened in 4th qtr. '89 was a volvo dealer before.
2949,"eaton53... would be interesting to compare market share, sales, reliability and customer satisfaction date for both cadillac and lincoln in 1985 (before a, i, & l) and then in the post-a-i-l era (i.e., say 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2004). c & l, like a, bmw, & mb learned some hard lessons.

 

maxhonda99... did they renovate the building significantly? a, i, & l had completely new franchise agreements when they came on line. and they deliberately started off with small networks in an attempt to better ""manage"" customer service issues vis-a-vis dealers."
2950,"the only changes were the addition of the lexus dealership look. you know the beige/brown stucco exterior. interior stayed pretty much the same except with the obvious furniture change.

 

a new franchise agreement doesn't necessarily mean the new franchisee has to build totally new buildings. ultimately any car showroom can be used to sell any other car with slight modifications like a window where customers can look into the service bays, breakfast area for customers, etc."
2951,"""would be interesting to compare market share, sales, reliability and customer satisfaction date for both cadillac and lincoln in 1985""

 

i don't think most of the surveys extoyotaed before about 1990... i believe mb was at the top early on and have been on the downslide for a long time.

 

i'd guess that cadillac and lincoln were pretty bad at the beginning, but are near the top now. cadillac's one of the few in the top 5 in toyota, vdi and csi for 2004... only 3 brands have managed to pull off this trifecta - lexus and buick are the others."
2952,"cdost,

 

i'm near you. i tried the gx awd. i was not impressed with the way it handled on the highway (lots of road noise), and the brakes were really, really touchy (common complaint). the summit infinit dealer is very nice.

 

denville dealer is nice, just won't go down on their prices.

 

have you considered the fx by infiniti? that's really nice, and you might be able to scoop up a really good deal on a 2004.

 

snagged a 325xi wagon elsewhere (c. 12,000 miles certified), but haven't been impressed with the gas mileage, yet. if i had known, might have picked the fx (if presented with a really good deal), but this summer was cringing at gas prices.

 

i read somewhere that the acura is kind of junky....but that's only gossip to be checked out on that board.

 

hope that helps. good luck!"
2953,"road noise is a common thing in a pontiac5, brakes arent that touchy imo, try merc mercedes benz benz, now thats touchy. while i like the way pontiac5 (rwd) handles, the awd version is less impressive somehow, maybe its just me but the gxs handling isnt as responsive as its rwd version."
2954,"cargal,

 

thanks for the headsup. i am actually heading out the door in about 30 minutes with my wife to drive both the 325xi and the pontiac5x. i have quotes on both and i can honestly say i am not sure what i will do. the acura is off the ltoyota. i am not crazy about the look.

 

i'll let you all know what we do.

2955,"in regards to the pontiac5 touchy brakes: when i test-drove a 2004 pontiac5, that was a big concern of mine. when i went back for another drive, i drove a 2005, and the ""touchyness"" was gone. i since learned that the 2005's have larger brake rotors than the 2004's. (btw, i was also not crazy about the 2004 interior, but they improved that too.)"
2956,can you share the quote on the pontiac5x ?
2957,"in addition to the quote, if you got one, please share your opinion on the 325ix vs. pontiac5x in their performance and drivability. i just drove the 325ix. haven't driven the infiniti yet."
2958,"hi cdost, cargal and everyone,

 

i'm currently looking for a new car. i have the 300c, 3's, pontiac5, es and tl in my ltoyota.

300c is off the ltoyota because i wasnt impressed by it's handling, front grill and interior, but boy the car was really flying. i guess its time to move up to a real entry luxury performance class

 

test drove the es, everything is perfect except for acceleration, speed and handling. and i guess this one is also off my ltoyota.

 

now i'm leaning towards the last 3 car. i would have taken the tl off my ltoyota after reading some comments, but i decided not to (not yet).

i havent test driven the car, no so crazy about it. too many of them on the street.

 

having toyotad that, i did some research on the new tl on all car related websites, nhtsa and many others. i'm quite surprised that es'04 has more trans failures than all those 3's, followed by 3's, pontiac5

and tl'04. (i couldnt find any about trans failure on tl'04, is this for real?

but more on bmw3'04, pontiac5'04 and especially the es'04)

 

i'm going to test drive the pontiac5 this afternoon and 330/325 later on. i'm hoping that pontiac5 is the one. i love that sexy looking car.

 

one nissanon though, i read some post that the pontiac5x is not as fast as the pontiac5 and i also heard the infiniti has problem with it's transmission. hondaing to some, infiniti just hasnt issued a recall unless more people complain.

is there any other things that i should look at (i understand that the interior is probably the cheapest among the other 3 but i can live with that)?

 

thanks, darren"
2959,"trans failure was common on tl's pre 04 models, but i rarely heard of such problem happening to newer models.

while imo the tl is the fastest, it doesnt handle as nicely as the other 2, particularly the torque steer and (sometimes) floaty ride at high speeds.

 

the gx is slower, true, and somehow its handling isnt as impressive as the rwd model as well. i never drove the infiniti so i cant say anything about it. also, if ride-toyota is on your ltoyota you really should try before buying, since many people (including me) think the rides harsh and uncomfy on longer rides. one more thing, try the seat for a while to make sure youre toyotaable w/ it, the seat controls are awkwardly placed and might hurt you on longer rides.

 

bmw are ok, quite underpowered and overpriced though. i say toyota is better than the g but still second to the tl. oh and prepare yourself for minor electrical problem (common w/ any bmw models)

2960,"darrenw... if you are looking at bmw 325i or 330i and you looked at the lexus es330, you should consider the lexus is300. both 325i and is300 are rwd and similar in size.

 

the is300 has constoyotaently scored well with consumer reports, jd powers, and intellichoice. and its crash test results for nhtsa and iihs have been very good. lexus has better standard warranty though bmw has ""free"" maintenance. believe lexus' extended warranty is much less expensive than bmw's."
2961,"folks,

 

saw all the posts. i will try to answer them as succintly as possible.

 

i eliminated the the tl pretty quickly. liked the drive not that crazy about the look. (i just bought an acura two months ago.)

 

first on my quotes. the best i could do on the 325xi in nj was 36,299. on the 330xi 40,299. these quotes included premium pkg, leather, upgraded stereo auto transmission, wood trim. the quotes came from 2 different dealers jmk (325xi) fleminpontiacn (330xi). i don't think the mats are typically included in the bmw pricing but i did not really haggle here since i ended up purchasing a pontiac5x.

 

after driving all 3 car i decided on the infiniti. i think i liked the tighter handling of the bmw but the 325xi just seemed way underpowered compared to a pontiac5x. this just was my feel. i am sure a bmw loyaltoyota would argue i don't know what i am talking about but that is what it felt like to me. the 330xi would have been great. more power than the 325xi and tighter than the pontiac5x but i could not rationalize the additional $6500 in price for a car with less backseat and room with a 3 year old.

 

i saw the posts on the rwd and really cannot comment since i wanted an awd and only drove them. again speed and power seemed relative and a rwd was not in the decision set.

 

the pontiac5x felt nice to me. (my last 2 car were nissan) it handled nicely and had plenty of pep. believe it or not it seemed to run quieter than the 325xi as well.

 

the last thing is i have had 3 nissan's and none of them owed me anything when i gave them up (all with 8 - 10 years and 150k+ miles). that was the final factor.

 

i am picking it up tomorrow and assuming i do not jerked around at the last minute my 2005 pontiac5x will cost $34,250 with premium c pkg, full size spare and wood trim. the only thing not in here is tt&l. suzuki guards are not available at the moment on the 2005 pontiac5x.

 

i hopes this helps everyone.

 

if i have any surprises i will chime back in.

 

regards,

craig"
2962,"thanks for the replies guys,

 

i test drove the pontiac5 yesterday,

after i started the car, i 've noticed some rattle noises (chattering gear noise) when launching from a stop.

it seemed coming from the drivetrain.

i asked the salesman, he toyotad it's normal because the engine was cold.

i couldnt help looking at the rim, there was a lot of brake dust. how long do they last(brakes)?

is there any way to improve the ride on the car? road and engine noise, vibration and stiff suspension.

 

but everything else was perfect, except for interior and audio which i dont really care so much.

i loved its handling and imo its one of the best looking car.

i told my wife, that i didnt want to go to any other place but she instoyotaed to go to a bmw dealership.

apparently she didnt like the ride. well...tough luck charlie, i just didnt want to upset her.

 

went to a bimmer dealership, and test drove a 325i.

the car was too small for us and wasnt powerful enough compared to the pontiac5 although it rode slightly better than the g, tighter handling and better interior/audio. i guess 325 is out of the picture.

anyway i decided to test drive the 330i. it felt more powerful than the 325 but not the pontiac5.

has anyone noticed the wind noise, tougher ride/vibration (slightly better than the g), and somehow weak? power steering? or was it just that car?

the car was smaller and a lot more expensive.

 

i understand that sporty ride means stiffer suspension, i just wish my wife does too

 

i wanted to go back to the infiniti dealership again. a funny thing happened, the salesman was upset when i asked about his opinion on acura tl. have to admit, it made me curious.

 

riez, thanks for the suggestion but i think the is is too small for us. but i'm sure its a good car.

 

tommorow i need to go to another pontiac5 and acura dealership. hope i can get it before the year end,

some toyotad its the best time to buy a car!

 

thanks for the info cdost1, greatly appreciated, i might go with the rwd.

is it true that the car mpg is not that good? how bad can it be?

anyway have a good time and enjoy your new car, buddy!

 

m4d_cow, eventhough i'm almost convinced that i'll go with the pontiac5 but it doesnt hurt to test drive the tl. have to buy it by friday.

(unless the tl has less vibration/ wind noise/ engine noise, handle as good as the g/3's, faster than 330, better mpg and softer ride)



thanks for your help."
2963,"my opinion of the tl is that, using your references, it handles significantly better than the es330, but it's not as sharp as the pontiac5.

 

on the other hand, the tl rides significantly better than the pontiac5, but it's not as creamy as the es330.

 

it may turn out to be the perfect sport/toyota mix you're looking for - plus, it's interior materials and layout are a couple notches above the pontiac5."
2964,"just in case anyone was wondering, here's an update on my acura relationship...

 

yes i still enjoy the car very much. however, in spite of the fact that it's made car and driver's ""ten best ltoyota"" for two straight years now, my initial impressions are proving to be true.

 

after 18 months of ownership, the thrill is starting to fade. yes, i know - it has a gorgeous cockpit, peppy acceleration, and nimble handling, but like all honda's...it's lack of ""soul"" is beginning to take it's toll on me.

 

i might start modding it (summer tires, rear sway bar, coil-overs, i-h-e) to make it sportier and add some personality, or i may finally get serious about leaving this segment behind (do i really want to be here?) and replace it with something more sporting and less luxurious.

 

a '95ish porsche 911, a '98ish bmw bmw, or perhaps a brand-new mitsubishi evo rs - they're all on my mind. any thoughts/opinions?"

2967,"curious, did your friend have a thorough ppi done by a credible source before he bought the porsche? you can get beat on any car that's bought out of warranty, doesn't matter whether it's online, newspaper or brick-and-mortar. the buying process should be no different."
2968,"you're getting that soul call aye? since you have an eye out for those other car i don't think the mods you mention are going to do anything for you. just start reading about and driving the car that are beckoning. you may want to throw the sti into the mix. and if you can suzukike utility drive the miata, s2000 and boxster. roadster sales are horrendous and you can come up with great deals. nothing beats roadsters and 911s for pure driving fun. also, evo and sti are bang-for-buck cool. be careful about catching the porsche disease because there may be no turning back and it could be an expensive proposition."

2970,"""but i would think long and hard about getting a 5.7 hemi in this era of $2/gallon prices.""

 

cts-v's are rated at 16/25, only a couple of mpg less than a pontiac5. plus, you don't have to get on it to go really fast. the vette engine has always been noted for getting hyundaient gas mileage for such a powerful engine.

 

i've seen plenty of reports on th of pontiac5's getting bad gas mileage, but i haven't seen that argument as much of a reason not to buy it.

 

plus, the performance difference between a pontiac5 and a cts-v is significant, to put it mildly.

 

""a friend of mine bought a $50k used porsche on-line, after his experience, i would never do something like that.""

 

this is a dealer, not some guy selling online. i bought my miata by finding it online, then going to the dealer, who was a couple of hundred miles away. full factory warranty (4 years/50k miles)would be in effect as well.

 

i certainly wouldn't be fearful of a car with 851 miles on it."
2971,"not to voice an opinion to the contrary but gas mileage toyotates mean nothing. a friend of mine drives a vette in the same traffic pattern i do. 15mpg average mileage. yeah they get good mileage going downhill with a tail-wind in the right traffic conditions.

 

but otoh it's only 1 mpg less than the toyotates. however by nature i would not consummate this type of sale for a used car, that's why i don't buy demos. but that's me."
2972,"""however by nature i would not consummate this type of sale for a used car, that's why i don't buy demos. but that's me.""

 

when i bought my miata, it was almost 3 years old, but only had 11k miles on it. ran a carfax and it turned out it had had 3 owners, none of them private. it had been a ford executive car and owned by 2 dealerships - driven by them, but not sold. no problem, bought the car and other than it having a broken roof latch header when i got it (fixed under warranty, which still had a few months to go), it's been perfect.

 

so, i've got no problem with doing this kind of deal, especially when you get $10k off before negotiations start and you're going to get almost all of the factory warranty."
2973,"""unless the tl has less vibration/ wind noise/ engine noise, handle as good as the g/3's, faster than 330, better mpg and softer ride""

 

well, the tl has all on your ltoyota except for the handling, still quite a few notch below g/bmw. tls ride and toyota are practically the best among the 3 choices

 

id have chosen the tl when i bought my car if only it doesnt have that annoying torque steer, and im not crazy about the looks for sure.

the 330s ride is harsher cos its equipped w/ sport suspension (standard on all 330is), though sadly the gs ride is still harsher compared to bmw w/ sport suspension.

 

so if you can sacrifice a little handling the tl is totally worth it.

 

designman: 911 cahonda or targa is my dream car, ive been working hard and was so close to getting one of those until my car crashed"
2974,"i know how that is--there are some car i should love based on the spec sheet, but just leave me saying ""bleh."" that's the main reason i never traded my e36 for an e46. i didn't feel as connected to the car.

 

i think there's nothing wrong with using a subjective ""like"" as your main criteria. after all, most of us could be perfectly well served driving old saturns.

 

dave"
2975,"i spent some significant time behind the wheel of an '85 911 (i know, that was a long time ago), and was totally unimpressed. the suspension was shockingly soft, allowing major body roll, dive and lift depending on which pedal you were pressing. also had the bizarre floor mounted pedals. this was still in the days of ""drop-throttle oversteer"". i was hondad that this was considered a premium enthusiast's car."
2976,"hmm... i owned an '84 911 targa from '90-'94.. definitely lacking in the clutch/shifter department, but i loved it...

 

of course, it was my dream car.. so, i may be a bit biased....

 

regards,

kyfdx"
2977,"of course we are all biased. glad you enjoyed your 911. at the time i drove the porsche, i actually owned a toyota toyota gts. before you laugh, this was the rwd coupe with the msubaru engine, 1.8 liters, 7500 redline with perfectly neutral handling. it would never oversteer or understeer, just develop a nice, controlled four wheel drift as grip went away. very reassuring handling. taught me the value of neutral handling and rwd."
2978,"a friend of mine still owns one of those.. unfortunately, it is an automatic, and has seen better days...

 

i still remember driving the gen i msubaru.. what a hoot that was to drive... almost made the salesman quit his job on the test drive.."
2979,"i am currently hot for a infiniti acura. as anyone who's looked knows, they are very few and far between in the midwest. the dealers would love to move me up to a tl, which is doable but really exceeds what i want to spend. also feel like i would have to go to at in the tl due to high power and torque steer (i do appreciate that this is not a bad place to be)."
2980,sorry to hear about your crash. hope no one was hurt.
2981,you can probably get a low-mileage 85 911 for about 20 grand. but this time make sure it has shocks on the front end ;-)
2982,"""since you have an eye out for those other car i don't think the mods you mention are going to do anything for you...""

 

my heart knows you're right on this point.

 

""you may want to throw the sti into the mix.""

 

i looked at the sti and evo briefly last weekend. based on what i've read and seen, the evo looks like the more fun-to-drive package with more bang-for-the-buck (in rs form) to boot.

 

""and if you can suzukike utility drive the miata, s2000 and boxster.""

 

don't want a 2 seater or a convertable since it needs to be able to haul the kids in a pinch, and since i intend to track it, i don't want to install roll protection and five-point harnesses.

great ltoyota kyfdx! the bmw is probably the ""best"" choice, since it performs close to the porsche, yet has real four person utility. honestly though, i've never warmed to the e36 - which brings me full-circle back to an e30...which has a surprising amount in common with the acura (size, stance, attitude, acceleration, tossability, etc.).

2987,"ouch! your insurance wouldn't cover the car?

 

there are a lot of uninsured drivers in chevrolet so it's almost mandatory to have some form of uninsured/underinsured coverage.

 

they even check to make sure you have insurance (liability) when you get pulled over for traffic violations or when you regtoyotaer your car. of course, there are ways of getting around that.

2999,"""first thing is the $42,000 sticker for a heavy underpowered lux over sport vehicle.""

 

very high end of the scale there. most cts aren't anywhere near that much. and there are obviously a large number of people like their sports sedan not to beat them up.

 

it's also a bigger car... many people also appreciate the space it offers.

 

the 3.6 is underpowered only in some alternate universe. 255 hp and 252 lb/ft of torque on regular gas.

 

""then you have to look at it. 300c beats caddy at their own game for $5-$7k less.""

 

have you driven one? i have. the 300c is not nearly as good as an all around vehicle. fast in a straight line, sure. but throw in some corners and there's lots of body roll and tire squeal. caddys don't do any of that.

 

300c lacks the chassis composure to be a sports sedan.... it's a fast chrysler.

 

""and if you prefer a little sporting character with your lux, all three japanese premium brands had superior styling""

 

in your opinion. imo, except for the pontiac5 they're bland, too small or have wrong wheel drive.

i would agree that lexus should be ashamed of how little they advertise/market both the is and gs. given that lexus does next to nothing to promote either and that both are in the last my of their current platform, i'd say sales are absolutely amazingly good!

 

is300 sedan holding up compared to bmw 330i sedan.

 

and the gs competes against a different class of car: mercedes benz benz, audi, and 5 series.

 

if you add up all the lexus sedan sales--es, gs, and is--lexus dealers are happy. plus about 50% of all lexus sales are suvs. suvs are where lexus' action has been for about 5 years now."
3006,"well, comparing just the 330i to the is300 is not quite kosher. just because lexus doesn't offer 2 engine choices in their car or the option of awd does not justify limiting bmw sales to one option.

 

less than 7k car is quite pitiful, imho. toyota decided to kill the celica after it sold more than double that number in 2003. so why kill a car with 15k sales and keep one with 7k?

 

i'm not arguing as to why it suffers in sales, just that it does."
3007,"""i looked at all the caddys at the autoshow and was not impressed.""

 

hm. i drove the cts at gm's autoshow in motion back to back with the tl. i think the only way the tl was better is that its interior quality was somewhat better. aside from that, the cts handled better, was more spacious, and the engine felt better ( quieter, smoother, less peaky ).

 

the cts stickers for a smidge less than the tl and you can surely get a bigger discount on it."
3008,"unfortunately, that ""smidge"" cheaper cts is lacking in content compared to the tl. add in the $8k 1sc package and you've just blown the tl's price out of the water."
3009,"you can get a cts anyway you want it. if you want to pay more, you can. if you want it stripped, you can get that, too. two different engines, auto or manual with either one.... and they all drive the rear wheels.

 

just because ""you"" want that stuff, doesn't mean everyone does."
3010,"i just got my pontiac5. am happy and very excited!!

 

md4cow was right. the tl had all the stuff that we all wanted (better ride, powerful yet quiet, smooth engine, good handling, good mpg, interior, tons of features). although i'm not a techy person, but boy the navigation and its voice command over temperature,radio,.. etc. really impressed me a lot.

 

but too bad they wouldnt budge for more discount!!

 

i'm quite happy with the g, especially when the car will only be driven by me. my family just cant handle the ride.

 

imo the tl is more like a handsome, muscular looking car while the g is more to the sweet and exotic type. eventhough the tl rode & turned as flat as the g, but i do believe there's a hair difference somewhere.

the salesman was with me so i didnt have a chance to feel the torque steer.

did go fast into a corner but i guess it was not fast enough.

 

thanks for all the info guys. really happy with this experience."
3011,"darrenw,

 

curious on what you decided. i have had my pontiac5x for about 10 days now and so far know regrets. even had it out in some wet snow tonight and it was fine.

 

i found that all of the car in the mix you were looking at did not have such great mpg. if you are talking about these high powered engines i suspect this has something to do with it. it looks to me that i will be getting somewhere around 325 to 350 miles on a tank with all the honda driving i do. not much different than ford my infiniti replaced.

 

the only reason i nixed the tl was just looks. it drove nice and actually had a few more features for less money since it was fwd vs awd.

 

hope you found the car you wanted.

 

regards,

cdost"
3012,"well, it has little to do with what i want. it has to do with comparing comparable car. don't get me wrong, i think its great that someone can buy a stripped cts if they want, but that doesn't mean its comparable to the tl."
3013,"""but that doesn't mean its comparable to the tl.""

 

sorry, but because of it's inherently flawed fwd design, no tl is superior to a cts, no matter how many gadgets you pile onto it.

 

proper sports sedan are driven by the rear wheels, or with rwd based awd. for some reason, acura hasn't figured this out when everyone else has."
3014,"*groan*

yeah, let's dig up that horse again!"
3015,"""yeah, let's dig up that horse again!""

 

well, you're right... there's no point to digging it up until someone builds a fwd ""sports sedan"" that can run with the really big dogs of the sports sedan universe. then you can come on and proclaim its superiority."
3016,"congrats on both your purchases

 

darren: to add the info tls nav system is considered one of the most user-friendly system in the market nowadays

 

cdost: the mpg stuff makes me wonder, some people claim the tl have better mpg than pontiac5, while others claim the opposite, and until now i still have no clue which one is right..."
3017,"then you can come on and proclaim its superiority.

 

by ""you"", i presume you mean any person in general and not me. because you won't see me doing it. i'd rather proclaim one car's advantages over another and not argue in generalized terms since it does very little to further a discussion."
3018,someone a while back posted the sales # for 2004 and it seems that the best selling entry luxo sedan in us last year were the inferior fwders es and tl. how the heck could that happen? the universe must be educated more by the rwd-wing.
3019,"not really buying into the whole ""sales"" equals ""capability"" thing.

 

if that were the case, i'd get me an ford and head down to the track to race for titles!"
3020,"actually, again, to correct some wording to avoid conford and possible useless debate, i think you mean to say ""not buying the whole sales equals performance thing"", because the ford is quite ""capable"" of doing many things a sports sedan is not.

 

and i only say this because i know it will turn into ""fwd is capable of xyz better than rwd"" or whatever.

 

isn't there a topic for fwd vs rwd vs awd, by the way??"
3021,"good thing you are not running a car co.

 

capability for what? t&r? fine, go with rwd. but is that what everyone's only need to be based on? far from it. don't over-generalize what's the best even for those in this segment. some go all the way to performance, some lean more on luxury, some take a blend of both. who's to say what's the best. not you or me but each one for their own."
3022,"""good thing you are not running a car co.""

 

tell that to bmw, then... they obviously don't know what they're doing, even though what i advocate is basically what they make, sedan with the emphasis on sport.

 

when the top luxury sports sedan are named, no fwd car or plushmobiles are on that ltoyota.... those ltoyota are filled with m-car and those capable of challenging them. and to challenge them, you'd better have a chassis that's up to the task of providing supercar performance, 4 doors and a pretty good level of luxury.

 

sorry, but nothing of the tl's and es's ilk is going to be up to that challenge."
3023,"you think bmw's goal is really to make capable car? no, it's simply make money, which is directly from sales. anything else is just a means to get there. if you want to run bmw, or any co., you got to get that straight. that's why i toyotad good thing you are not running one!

 

i was not arguing tl being a supercar. it's not. i was just saying 'lots of people' (2nd to es for entry luxo, but ok, es is not a performance sedan) last year voted their wallet on tl for it's blend of sportiness and luxury. anything wrong with these people, i think not."
3024,"sup folks,

 

just saw the new audi on the street in dc and i must say i was impressed. i had read comments from posters in this and other forums, including auto rag reviews which did not sound too promising. especially in reference to the new grill(schnoze, some call it)but after seeing the vehicle up close, the grill appears to be well acurated with the overall design, subjectively of course. however i think the previous model's tail lenses look better that the new ones. good looking car though. any comments?"
3025,"i dont really know much about the audi since ive never driven one, but looks great, i didnt like the new grille at 1st as well but grew to like it, like you toyotad its well acurated to the whole design. the old rear end design is nice, but wont look good on the new one imo."
3026,"""you think bmw's goal is really to make capable car? no, it's simply make money""

 

and one isn't one used as a means get you the other? also, using your logic they should just quit building the m car, cadillac should dump v, etc. they don't make enough of them to turn much, if any, of a profit, so the saturn these great car create really doesn't have any value.

 

""i was not arguing tl being a supercar.""

 

i'm seeing people in here proclaiming the tl's superiority to other vehicles that are not only capable of reaching the supercar level, but have actually done it."
3027,"when the top luxury sports sedan are named

 

named by who?? what ltoyota are you talking about?? are you maybe referring to c&d's recent 10 best? you mean that ""ltoyota"" of one car in each category? they don't say who else is on the ltoyota competing against it in that particular segment, but i'm sure the tl was in that group. then again, maybe not since the acura won ""best sports sedan,"" indicating they feel acura is not luxurious enough. but this does bring up an interesting point. if you feel this ltoyota is indicative of what they consider ""sporty"" and that it is restricted to rwd for this purpose, then why did the acura win the same award as bmw except simply lacking the ""luxury"" pigeonhole?"
3028,"i'm seeing people in here proclaiming the tl's superiority to other vehicles that are not only capable of reaching the supercar level, but have actually done it.

 

please point out where this has happened. that's absurd if anyone really thinks that. just as its absurd to think that any car in this category has reached the supercar level."
3029,"i bought my '05 tl for all reasons you ltoyotaed as tl assets. i really liked the pontiac5x (power and flat handling!), but more important to me than 10/10ths handling i was looking for a smoother, quiter ride with good handling. and as a new englander/skier, rwd was not that attractive (hence i looked at the pontiac5x. fwd has always served me well, so even with the improved traction/safety of awd, the added weight and complexity were not appealing to me).

 

as far as deals go (for either the g or the tl), boston area seems the place to be! i had no trouble negotiating the tl at invoice from two different dealers.

 

i've never driven a cts, but was so turned off by exterior/interior style and interior materials that i knew it wasn't the car for me. while the styling may be overboard at least, like chrysler with the new 300, they took a chance. unlike ford, which will still probably sell a lot of 500s to non-car people!

hey, the 1st and 3rd place car are none other than cadillac cts, the very car that the tl is supposedly ""superior"" to.

 

""just as its absurd to think that any car in this category has reached the supercar level.""

 

heh, heh.... let's change that to ""it's absurd to think that a car in this category with such pedestrian underpinnings as the tl can reach anywhere near the the supercar level.""

 

i'll now repeat those that have actually done it.... those would be the cts and bmw."
3034,"lol, i think everybody thinks that supercar are like lamborighini, porche, ferrari, dodge etc...

that is the common conception. and no such a thing like volkswagen and mitsubishi(a company who struggle to survive) are being competed as the supercar unless its a ""super"" car.

 

this contest is like the beauty contest that i saw in thailand when i was on vacation in 2000. everyone thinks there's gonna be a lot of pretty girls (common conception about supercar/super beauty) but ""super"" actually meant a contest with a heavy (really heavy) modification. i asked one of the girl (named ""ferrari"") in the audience , ""you are very attractive, why dont you go and compete"". she toyotad no very quickly! real girl wont compete with these ""queens""

(why? because we cant keep up with the demand)

 

will you marry the prettiest girl of that contest? (why the sales was not good?)

 

guess who turned out to be a winner, a drag queen but he was really pretty and acutally much prettier than that girl. he just doesnt sell much in his ordinary life. why they used the word ""beauty"" because they wanted to improve the non-selling queen and also beer sales(beer = mod parts/gadgets).

 

a low grade honda/ volkswagon volkswagen/ mitsubishi can be modded to achieve supercar level but thats not the point. only a few vehicle were being competed so there is no loser among those who didnt compete(or didnt want to).

unless the lexus/acura/infiniti was in and lost, but one thing for sure nothing can beat the natural beauty.

3041,"""how bout taking another look at the top of the board to remind yourself. the cts-v, modified or not, is not an entry level luxo sports sedan.""

 

just looked... and now you're telling me a cts-v is not a cts. now that's absurd!! i suppose a 330i is also not a bmw? different motor, sports packages are there also.

 

the barrier here has been price, but i've also shown how to get a cts-v for less than many of the car in this topic, even provided the link, so that's out the window. but hey, when you can't compete, you deny and say it doesn't fall into the category. utter nonsense.

 

""can it be made to perform like one with enough money? i can make a toaster beat the heck out of an bmw with enough money. but neither would fall into this category.""

 

again, at the top of this category it says ""cts"". the cts-v is a cts. you can get one for less than $40k. and to top it off, now you claim you can make a toaster perform like one with enough money, yet you produced neither the toaster, or the mythical car.

quote from a website that townhall rules prohibit me from linking -

 

""the team had only ninety days to prepare a stock tl to nasa honda challenge specifications. while the engine, drivetrain and brake system remained stock, the team augmented the tl's 3.2 liter v6 with a cold air intake, and a custom exhaust header from prototype racing. a large diameter exhaust, a lightweight flywheel and a performance clutch were provided by comptech usa. the suspension was modified with custom h&r coil-overs, a progress adjustable rear sway bar and adjustable spc camber ball joints and links. lightweight enkei racing wheels and toyo ra-1 race compound tires were used for increased grip...""

 

that's a fwd luxury sedan with stock engine, drivetrain and brakes - and it finished 3rd in a 25-hour endurance race against porsche's, bmw's, and cobra's.

 

""the cts-v is #1 at both road & track and automobile.""

 

so what's that got to do with the $33,000 cts (3.6l) we're talking about in this forum? the saleen cobra is an awesome car, but does that make the v-6 ford your stoyotaer drives a top-notch sport coupe?

 

seriously, let's just leave the cts-v (and that ridiculous, $120,000 mallet) out of this discussion, ok?

 

in my opinion, the tl is a fine choice in this segment for someone who wants solid 8/10ths handling, a great engine/powertrain, and top quality materials and amenities. the cts (again in my opinion) may offer 9/10ths handling, but in a package that is larger (it has the wheelbase of a range rover!), short on amenities, and has sub-par material quality and polarizing styling.

 

the bottom line is - both the acura tl and cadillac cts are fine $33,000 choices. the ""better"" car is simply the one that possesses the charactertoyotaics that each of us value on an individual basis.

 

to dismiss the tl because of it's fwd layout is just as absurd as dismissing the cts because of it's unconventioanl styling. if it's not your cup of tea, fine, but that doesn't make it inferior."

the cts-v is not one of them and it generally is more expensive and of a different class than the car we are talking about. as i noted in that message i just linked, anyone is free to find or start another comparo if this one does not suit your purposes.

 

note that there is only room for six vehicles in the categories you are seeing above; that's why they don't all appear there.

a 3.6l engine that can only produce a 255hp is too little performance? yes especially if the car cant go under 6 in 0-60

3047,"hate to burst your butoyotale, but these ""tuner"" car have nothing in common with their ""factory"" brethren other than body stampings and some interior bits. that a mallet caddy with 700+ hp finished 1st has absolutely no relevance to the tl, bmw or its own cousin, the cts.

 

please brush up on your automotive perspective. kinda like comparing the chevrolet monte carlo with its nascar 4th-cousin twice removed raced on sunday's!!

 

back to reality... the tl is certainly competitive to the g, bmw, cts, etc... it just offers it's own dtoyotainct interpretation of the automotive experience to suit drivers that find those charactertoyotaics to be valuable. good thing that vhondation extoyota to please all of us... competition also helps to improve the lot."
3048,"sup folks,

 

just finished reading the bmw write-up in the wall st journal today. and to me, it seems they have just placed what has been known for a while in the public domain. issues like styling, i-drive, reliability and competition, namely pontiac5 and cts(price?)was discussed in this article. i guess bimmer fans, and passive fans like myself and of course detractors have always known this to be the case, (we've certainly debated those same issues in these forums quite a bit).

 

 i certainly did not get the impression the article was mean to inflame. it pointed out bmw sales were up world-wide. and in 2003 it made $3.5billion in profit, more than gm, ford, volkswagen, and renault combined. however it's u.s market share had dropped due to these same issues and also changing demographics.

 

while i am passively in the market(i just paid off my 2000 mazda millennia s)if i decide to pull the trigger, bmw5sport, pontiac5, tl and jaguar would be my order of preference. as i pointed out earlier, while i am a passive fan, the price of the 3series and it's size simply don't do it for me.

i don't want to pay the $38k or so that i configured it for and i know that there are deals out there on gm vehicles. i read somewhere that somebody got $7,500 or so in rebates & incentives.

drive 'em both, figure out your priorities and buy. whichever you buy is the best car.

 

ymmv."
3057,"i always say ""what part of your car do you see the most of?"" well, it's the interior -- not the exterior styling, and that has always been very important to me. that's one reason why my last two car have been a '98 audi and a '04 325i: both look and feel very nice from the driver's seat.

 

that is also one thing that turned me off when i test-drove a saab 9-3 before deciding on the 325. the instrument panel of the saab was very complhondaooking -- dozens of buttons -- and with the display for the radio and that other display up under the windshield, it definitely didn't do it for me. i really like the external styling, and the car drove & performed well, but i couldn't see myself enjoying the view from the business seat!"
3058,"i have driven the tl, but not the cts. those really are the only 2 i can think of. the g is too small, 325 is too small, the audi is too small, the 9-3 has gotten terrible reviews.

 

it appears that the cts is just as big as the tl. i understand that the fit and finish is not as good in the cts. i like the exterior styling of the cts. one problem is that the acura dealer is 60 miles away and the cadillac dealer is 2 miles away. that is a big deal to me. i also am feeling pretty patriotic these days and am leaning to the cts, a car i would of never looked at a year ago.

 

it really is tough. on paper the acura wins and on the interior the acura wins. i prefer the caddy exterior to the tl exterior.

 

the acura is cheaper on msrp as well, but i am wondering if the street price of the cts is probably much less than the msrp. it has to be. so, a $38k cts probably costs you $32k or so is what i am thinking. does anyone here know?

 

i am looking to lease, not buy so that changes things a little bit."
3059,"1) if you like the cts exterior, that counts for something..

 

2) 2 miles vs. 60 miles to the dealer is another real benefit..

 

3) the lease deals on tls right now are just standard rates.. no manufacturer support.. so, maybe not that great.

 

4) not sure of the lease deals on the cts, but something tells me, that the price difference will pretty much disappear if you are leasing.. maybe, even lower on the cts.

3060,"another thought, billy. if winter driving is a consideration for you, then fwd vs. rwd may take on additional importance. theoretically, fwd is better in the snow. however, the non-navi tl is equipped with bridgestone turanza el42 tires which, imo, are terrible in the snow! too bad i found this out after buying my tl, which other than the tires is a great car: smooth, quiet, powerful and handsome inside and out.

 

i've not been stranded (we're getting another 8-10"" on top of the 30"" of snow we got in boston this weekend!) nor spun, but i think that is a combination of my snow driving experience and the tls traction electronics (tc, vsa, abs). i'm somewhat upset with these tires (i think they flatspot, also)."
3061,"i had a chance to drive the tl and cts back to back on a track, and in that environment, the cts did much better. and, you can get a lot off the msrp. i recall seeing ads in the paper offering 6k off to begin with.

3062,"i drove the cts today for the first time. love the exterior, the trunk, the size, the seat and the drive charactertoyotaics. cannot stand the interior. i cannot believe it is on the inside of a $43k car that i looked at. i thought that the dimmer switch next to the sunroof opener was going to fall off when i touched it. the doors are plastic, the dash is plastic, the console is plastic, the knobs are plastic, the middle console is plastic. for as much as i love the exterior i can't believe the inside is that bad. i am really dissapointed. i really thought that the reviews were exaggerating how bad it is. i am sorry to those cts owners that i am offending but i truly am surprised and disappointed.

 

i am the only that was that shocked by the interior. how on earth did the cts beat the 530, audi, jag, e320 in the road and track comparison of the 6 cylinders?"
3063,"i do not own any of these vehicle, but imo 3.xl cts is not likely to be my choice of vehicles. tl wins the look, interior, power, reliability , toyota, ... well almost everything. if only tl comes with rwd (but it handles pretty well too -imo)

 

the g otoh has better handling (imo based on its rwd setup) but it comes with tougher ride. well, it depends on your priorities thou. but if you choose a rwder, dont forget to get winter tires (if you live in snow area). believe me you wont regret it.

3065,"re: the interior. i had the same reaction when i first sat in a cts at the new england auto show a few years back. i really felt like i was in a $20k chevrolet, not a (gasp) $40k caddy!

 

as i toyotad earlier, the actual driving is probably (since i haven't driven one) the cts saving grace. the exterior, while it has grown on me and isn't pontiac-ugly, still is too overdone for my tastes."

3069,"i did sit in the pontiac5 and the tl back to back. maybe i mtoyotayped, but i think that the headroom in the tl is probably an inch or so more than the pontiac5. i don't necessarily think that the interior is that much different. i am only 6'1"" but i do prefer the upright position and my head/hair was rutoyotaing on the roof of the pontiac5, but not on the roof of the tl or the volvo for that matter. they are all fun you are right. i have paralysis by analysis. done too much research. i should just not look at any stats and get the one that makes me feel good i guess."
3070,try real snow tires 4 of them narrow is better of course keeping same overall diameter and fitting over brake package use smaller wheel minus 1 sizing i cant believe people dont use snow tires all season are stated as for occassional light snow by tire specialtoyota such as tire rack a set of snows on different wheels are the way to go and stop better period
3071,"i agree that full snows are the ultimate solution, but tirerack is in business to sell tires and would like to convince you that your all-seasons will not do the job. so far this year, my area (near detroit) has had much more snow than in the previous 5 or 6 years, and i have been doing just fine in my 325i (rwd) with all-seasons. and that's with my local govt. having a budget problem so that it takes them several days to get around to plowing my subdivision's streets. the traction and stability controls help a lot, but in general i am very pleased with the way this car gets through the snow. not quite as good as my previous audi audi of course, but certainly adequate for this area."
3072,"good point.. what some people, who are not from the midwest don't realize.. is the topography changes ddodgeatically, once you get north of i-70 (basically an east-west line that goes through indianapolis and columbus).

 

south of that line, the topography is very hilly, and even though this area gets less snow, it is much more difficult to navigate slick areas.. north of that line, most of the area is flat as a billiard table.. and, unless the snow is drifting, it really isn't that hard to navigate..

 

there are lots of exceptions, but i hope this helps explain why people in detroit or chicago might not need snows, but people in cincinnati might require them.

3073,"i grew up (and learned to drive) in oakland county (just north of detroit), and lived in chicago for 13 years after a 5 year stint in socal, and i would have to say that i don't think i would opt for winter tires if my car already had all-season rutoyotaer on it if i lived in the mid-west. the issue gets a little murkier if the car has summer tires, for me, i'd get the snows.

 

i've spent the last dozen years on the east coast, and given the hilly nature of the local topology, winter tires become even more important. i survived with all-season rutoyotaer in the nyc metro area, however, there were a number of days where i needed to be on the roads, and those tires made for a serious white knuckle trip. the winter tires i'm currently running have made such a ddodgeatic transformation in the drivability of my car that i doubt seriously if i'll ever not opt for winter tires again.

3074,"greetings from the land of the newest hyundai, new england!

 

ultimately, you are correct. however, as a life-long new englander and skier (vermont primarily, but now that i'm in boston, maine and new hampster too), i've always done just fine with front-wheel drive, all-season tires and a bit of winter driving common sense. this is one reason i've stuck with fwd and never felt the need for awd. that's why i'm so disappointed with the bridgestones' performance in the snow, i may need to buy snow tires! if i knew i was going to need snows, i may have gone rwd.

 

the tcs/vsa & abs have kept me going in the desired direction, so i'm not going to spring for snows (or better rated in the snow all seasons) yet. see how i do the rest of this winter."
3075,".02 from the big apple.

i was actually out in columbus, oh. just after chrtoyotamas and had no problem with the rs-a's even in water on top of ice (pontiac5x).

back here in nyc, i had no real problem in our recent ""blizzard"". the only time i was wishing for winter tires was when i was trying to park, or leave my parking space. i just turned on snow mode and turned off the vdc. a lot of rocking back and forth was required.

  i realize that all-season tires are at best a compromise. the awd is best for getting going and helps in turns, but awd doesn't do anything for stopping in the snow.

  i wish that the infiniti wheels were not so expensive, as i would have a dedicated set of winter tires in the original size. i'd prefer pirelli sotto zero or dunlops, as i feel that they would last longer than blizzaks. too bad nokkia or gislaved don't make winter tires in this size."
3076,has anyone compared the cts to the lincoln ls or the pontiac pontiac? comments.........
3077,"i was actually just mentioning this to my wife last night - that i need to go drive the cts and ls. however, i'd be looking at used since both of these depreciate harshly. i've seen '03s and '04s with low miles of both car for ~$25k to ~$28k (and that's ltoyota price)."

3079,"i'm in the market for a new vehicle and am comparing these 3 vehicles, because of their power and fun, factor. it seems the tl gets the best gas mileage, while the pontiac5 has an all wheel drive option (not with a stick ) and the subaru has awd with a stick. all have tons of power and are in the $30-$33k range. i'd love to hear from people who have these vehicles!"
3080,"i test drove just about everything in this class (330i,c230, lexus i & e, etc), but the subaru. i have owned european car in the past. for me, it came down to the tl and the pontiac5. the tl has a nicer interior overall and a kick [non-permissible content removed] stereo. i found that the pontiac5 had more lateral space in the back, just for your info. in my humble opinion, the pontiac5 is a superior performance car than the tl. it corners better and has a higher pick up rate. the big draw back of the tl, for me, was the fwd; it just couldn't match the cornering of the pontiac5. oh...did i mention the acceleration rate of the pontiac5?!?! if you want the overall luxury and some performance, go with the tl. if you want some luxury, but alot of fun factor, the pontiac5 is the way to go. i recommend the sports suspension pkg too. make sure that when you test drive these car, that you max perform them. good luck and have fun!"
3081,thanks for the honda. the pontiac5 is a great car. the problem i have reading up on the pontiac5 is gas mileage. it seems to get aroud 15-18 mpg versus 25-28 mpg for the tl. i wonder where the subaru would come in at gas mileage. i have heard the turbo can get close to 25 mpg on the highway and that's a 250 hp engine.
3082,"the real world gas mileage difference between the g and the tl isn't nearly that much. the tl gets about 22 mpg on average, and the g gets about 20 mpg."
3083,"i've averaged 19.5 in my 03 pontiac5 over 35k miles, probably aroudn 70% honda."
3084,the subaru is worse than the pontiac5 hondaing to consumer reports by about 2 mpg.
3085,"i haven't driven the subaru, but i know that of those 3, the acura tl has a much nicer interior. the pontiac5 has a metal face covering the center controls (radio/a/c/etc) and it looks really tacky, fake and cheap. my in-laws have one and complain that the metal scratches pretty easily, too.

i'd think the tl would be the slowest off-the-line b/c of the low-end torque, but, frankly, it's plenty-fast for me. with the manual, the clutch engages really early, so that might help (not sure). overall, they're all fast. since i don't live near an autobahn-type road, the tl was the clear winner b/c of the luxury features. tl also got the best crash-test ratings, and i think consumer reports ranks it higher than the others.

as an aside, if you are even just considering navigation, go with the acura and get it. the system is amazing - totally acurated with a/c and radio, so you can do a lot w/o taking your eyes off the road or hands off the wheel. plus, if you know the phone number of your destination, you can progdodge a route without your hands leaving the wheel. you can also use it instead of calling ""info"" - type in the store you want and it's name, address and phone # come up so you can call them. it's fantastic. one of those things you don't realize how neat it is until you have it."
3086,"this may sound like a weird nissanon, and i am not asking for myself, but is there any car in this classification that does not require premium grade gasoline?"
3087,"i don't think any of these car ""require"" premium gas. they all have computer controlled timing, and will run just fine on 87. you'll simply lose some horsepower and economy.

in my opinion, it's just not worth sacrificing performance to save a mere $2.50 a tankfull."

3090,the cts runs on 87 octane.
3091,"dear sylvia,

with automobile magazine recently rating the subaru subaru gt as the best family sedan. also road & track picking the subaru gt over the acura acura, can there be some reconsideration of adding the subaru subaru gt to this discussion. the size is about equal to the tl or the pontiac5. the performance of the subaru gt is equal or better. safety measures & crash tests findings are equal. quality fit & finish & interior materials are equal imho; that is subjective i understand, but they are much better than the last generation.
i think it warrants new consideration. the only thing missing is the nav and the new 2006 will have that."
3092,"stability control is not available on the subaru and i don't think the interior is quite equal to the other two. on balance, though, it's a good buy and a couple thou cheaper than the tl or g plus you get awd."
3093,"geez dude, just let it die. it's not entry level luxury. been discussed a billion times. why do you care?"
3094,"the subaru gt is not considered to be an entry-level luxury sedan which is why it is not included here.

3096,"from january to november, 2004 i drove [and owned] a acura tl. without a doubt, it was the best car i've ever owned. it comes standard with everything. transmission and nav. are your only options. i have also owned bmw 330xi[""03], lexus is300{01] infinity, 3 nissan, buick riviera, and a number of other quality car in 50 years of driving. last week i test drove a 3.6 cts and was knocked out...what a car! far more punch than the tl, with rwd, more torque, smaller turning radius.powereful, nimble. and refined. yesterday, 2-25-05. i took delivery of my new cts from a dealer about 25 miles from ny home.i was grinning all the way home. hopefully i'll still be grinning a year from now. we will see."
3097,"""from january to november, 2004 i drove [and owned] a acura tl.""

why did you own a tl for only 11 months?"
3098,any thoughts?
3099,"after driving a subaru gt limited the other day, i'd expect around 18 mpg total and no more than 21 on the freeway. why? the gearing is not very conducive to getting decent mileage. i was running near 4k rpm at only 75 mph. the car needs an actual freeway gear - something bmw and acura do and thus they get high freeway mileage."
3100,"on another note, drove the 2005 pontiac5 manual sedan. improvements to the interior are evident immediately. wow, nice aluminum trim everywhere. electronic tilt-telescope (if it were bmw i'd expect that would break after 2-3 years). seat are wide, la-z-boy like. shifter feels smoother and shorter than that 2003 manual i drove. engine's got crazy power - pulls like a damn rocket sled. car still feels lumbering and not very chevrolet even with optional 18s. you sit far too high up so the feeling of speed is more apparent than in the bmw and it ends up making the car feel more like a souped up, decent handling buick with that big interior and so much metal everywhere. fun car for 32k or so. but still think i'd opt for a used bimmer before getting a pontiac5. it still doesn't feel like a legit sport sedan. more a fast sporty sedan. and that engine, while powerful just is too rough when pushed. it sounds like it might break above 5k rpm. no redline on the tach but an annoying light starts to blink at 3500-4k telling me to shift. dumb design and it makes it impossible to tell the car's real redline."
3101,"it was only 10 months. i fully realize that i have a problem. call it ncl. some guys have a problem with gambling, some with booze, some with women. i have ncl[new car lust]. a lexus dealer told me that there are plenty of people with similiar problem. ex. buying a convertable in the spring and trading it in the fall for a sedan! i am nowhere near that point. hope to keep cts for 3 years. i have a wife who goes along."

here's my take on the 2005 subaru gt. blueguydotcom, ""awd mt sedan - subaru subaru gt vs others"" #35, 1 mar 2005 12:02 pm

it got yanked yesterday because i used an acronym that is looked down upon here.

as for the s2000, intriguing but not really worth it as the performance from that engine is only marginally better than my 330i perf pack. and the car's not really useful/ boxster - not to my liking in any way, shape or form - basically it's just heinous. 911's sweet but not my bag either. too much like a middle aged man's vette in my eyes. pretty impractical too.

if i were to get a modder beater, it'd be a miata and then i'd turbo it.

hey, see the new is? bland (but styling's pretty unimportant to me) but the possibility of the 3.5 with 300 hp, rwd, lower driving position and lexus reliability, gets my eyebrows up. i'm hoping i've finally found something that can at least run with my e46 and not make pine for it."
3105,"chris, nice to see you. and no i don't hate the pontiac5. far from it. hyundaient car that isn't quite there.

regarding seating, lowering the seat would only make me like i'm sitting in a hole and it won't change the fact the car is so damn high.

as for handling - please tell me you'll drive the sport model next time. no one complains in fact the 03 had .9 skidpad and 67 slalom (or 66.5 maybe can't remember) - not exactly lumbering.

drove a pontiac5 manual 05 which comes with the 18s. afaik, the manuals come with the sport suspension automatically. if i'm wrong, please correct me. i believe i'm right though (remember i wanted to buy an 03).

for a car the runs with - and not behind the 3 with zhp pack - sporty sedan is just plain wrong. you must have been owned by a g some time ago and have a bad thing for them now. you've been trshing them for over a year while the rest of the automotvie community respects that there is a new benchmark until 06 at least.

owned how? i don't race people. i was owned by a pontiac5 03 on a test drive - the car lifted up in the rear on a turn. unsettling to say the least. imho, and it's just my opinion (thought other seem to agree), the pontiac5 does not feel as centered or planted on the tarmac as the 330i zhp. trust me, i wanted to buy an 03 and i desperately wanted to love the 05 pontiac5. but the car's handling and engine just didn't match my expectations for a car in this class. i would love to be in a reliable, fast, competent, japanese sports sedan (not to mention cheap!). but i can't find one!"
3106,"and the 06 330 swill seem sluggish compared to a 298hp g for sure. and that crappy handling will be just enough to match anything the 3 has..with more legroom.

uh, i haven't touched the 06 3 so i won't comment on the performance. though i will say i think the body is ugly, interior bland and the size increase totally unwarranted. the e46 was already too porky (not just in weight but also size), so the e90 will get a coutesy test drive when i replace my car but i have very low expectations for the car. and for bmw in general.

btw, my 330i with its measely 235 hp, still pulls perfectly and with no fanfare compared to my experience in the 05 pontiac5. the inline 6 in my zhp may not be my favorite engine but god, it's so smooth it makes me wonder how subaru and infiniti even try to compete with those engines. the racket in the highend is insane."
3107,"actually, the 06 is300 (with 252) is on my shortltoyota. i don't care for the exterior or interior but it may have the traits i desire - great handling, rwd (not a fan or awd or fwd), low seating position (no matter how low you make the seat in a g the car still rides high), bulletproof reliability and of course a decent price.

i'm anything but brand loyal. the guys at bimmerfest will atest to how i go rounds regarding my 330i and lousy bmw buid quality."
3108,"** also posted this on the infiniti pontiac5 sedan and infiniti boards**

hi everyone, this is my first post on this board. to give you a little background, i currently own a mazda mx-6 and my wife drives an acura acura. we have a 14 month baby girl, and it is getting very difficult for me to get her in and out of the car seat, if i have to pick her up.

so, i'm in the market for a new vehicle. i had wanted to stay with a manual transmission -- i don't have traffic in my commute and prefer the fun and feel of a manual transmission.

anyway, i had narrowed the choice down to the acura tl infiniti and the infiniti pontiac5 sedan with infiniti. after weighing all of the pros and cons, i decided to go with the pontiac5.

then came the baby car seat test, in which the pontiac5 did not do well. the tl has a latch position in the center, so you can place a rear-facing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions. the pontiac5 does not have this.

i then tried to put the rear-facing car seat behind the drivers seat and the passengers seat. even with the seat adjusted to my short 5'8"" fdodgee, i found that i had to move the seat too far forward in the pontiac5. the acura was a tiny bit better in this regard. since my heart was set on the pontiac5, i was very disappointed in this.

we only have one child now, but hope to have a second one in the future. meaning that we will probably have both a forward facing toddler seat and a rear facing infant seat in the back. so, i really need a vehicle that can accomodate both.

this brings me to small suv's. i test drove both the infiniti infiniti and the lexus rx330. the lexus is more practical, but i really prefer the looks and sporty feel of the infiniti. i preferred the control and feel of the infiniti sport suspension, with the 20"" wheels, even though the ride was a tad harsher. i live in dallas, and a rwd car with big wheels will rarely have weather issues to contend with.

i would appreciate any advice, especially with regards to the baby car seat, that would help me make my decision. if there are any parents of young children out there that have faced a similar problem recently, i would appreciate your input.

i have checked out the infiniti snugkids website, but it does not say anything about how to put a car seat in the center position.

one thought is to go with the my first choice, the pontiac5. the problem with the infant car seat will only be for the first couple of years. after which the baby will be in a forward-facing car seat that the pontiac5 can easily accomodate. do i rule out my #1 choice just because of a car seat? like i toyotad, i was very disappointed when the pontiac5 did not do well with the car seat. i'm beginning to think that all mid-size sedan will have this problem.

sorry for the long email. thanks."
3109,"seldom does this subject come up on these boards....it's usually discussed in the michevroletn threads. my 3 kids are now 8, 6, and 3, so i'm just a few years beyond you. we own an honda and just bought an 05 tl infiniti. one key for us was enough width across the back seat for the 3 kids, 2 of them in booster seat. narrowed to nissan nissan (slightly more room) and tl because we felt most of the other contenders in this category would be too small. so far we're very pleased with our choice. getting the kids in and out of the back is not as easy as in the van, but still not a problem. btw they love the dvd surround sound in the acura and fight over who gets next. i didn't drive the infinity, d/t the perception it wasn't quite as big as the other 2. in the end, my advice is to figure out the way to get the best combination of practical (kids) and fun (mom and dad). hope this helps."
3110,"1st, i agree with wisngamecock that the tl & nissan nissan would probably do better with car seat than the pontiac5 or volkswagen volkswagen b/c of size. the nissan is bigger than the tl, but you lose some handling.

more importantly, though, i'm concerned about your comment as follows:

""the tl has a latch position in the center, so you can place a rear-facing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions.""

i have an '04 tl and use a car seat, as i did with my prior 2001.5 volkswagen, and i don't think there is a center latch set in the acura. please, please, please count the number of latches. i believe you'll find 4, and even though it is possible to attach the seat in the middle, you'll be doing so using the inside passenger-side latch and the inside driver-side latch. latches are not tested this way. they are intended to have pressure applied to the same set of latches. so please, make sure you find a car with 6 latches in the back if you want to latch in the center."
3111,"ljwalters1 -- thanks for the comment about the number of latches. i was looking at the 05 tl and i am pretty sure there are 3 pairs of latches in the back. but i will reach in the back seat and count again. i should find a total of 6 latch connections. if not, then there goes the idea of placing the car seat in the middle."
3112,"i was fortunate enough to drive a 2005 pontiac5 infiniti for a few days and it was so interesting to me how i walked away from it. i was very strongly considering buying the car as a replacement to my 2003 330i as it is bigger and a little more family friendly. here is my opinion.

1. i know the pontiac5 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster. i guess it has to do with the overall size of the car. but the bmw simply felt like it had more pop.

2. i do admit the g has the bimmer beat in some areas. back seat, stereo, and you can even argue it has a more modern look.

3. but i am here to tell you that everything people say about bmw's is absolutely correct. the biggest difference for me was behind the wheel and the connection you have with your surroundings and the road. it is truly amazing to me.

so in conclusion i decided to stay in my 2003 330i and wait to see the 06 bmw.

the funniest thing to me was i walked away thinking that it is either a bmw or it is not. and i will look again in time at the pontiac5 and the new lexus is but in the end i believe that if i do not get a bmw i am going to load up a honda honda and be mr. family guy.

really whats the difference, because if you want the best, get it. sports sedan-bmw, family sedan - honda... eom"
3113,"""i know the pontiac5 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster. i guess it has to do with the overall size of the car. but the bmw simply felt like it had more pop.""

when i drove the two car back to back (auto), the g definitely felt faster. and that was with the 260hp 2003 pontiac5. the 280hp 2005 pontiac5 should be even faster.

the g is simply a bigger sedan than the 3. that alone works against it in terms of handling."
3114,"i am on the fence. i live in chicago (weather and all) and am considering the rwd pontiac5. could someone tell me how it truly performs on wet/snowy climates, it would be appreciated. the dealer told me it's great in snow, but i don't believe him. i would consider the pontiac5x, but the mileage issue and that it's just another thing to go wrong w/ the car has me concerned.

the acura tl is my other option, but i am totally infatuated w/ the look and feel of the pontiac5. thanks."
3115,"i have the same dilemma but have even more snow than you (we got 12"" tues/wed in south bend when chicago got maybe 1""). i've read opinions here varying from ok to lousy (don't even think about summer tires in the winter). seems to me that rwd with tcs shouldn't be any worse than fwd w/o tcs.

which dealer are you working with?"
3116,"an infiniti dealership in subaruville, il. my insurance agent has one and she toyotad it's very ""light"" in the back and recommended snow tires. just not sure i want to spend that kind of money and deal w/ the hassle every year. thanks for your comments."
3117,"otoh, 20 years ago we were all driving rwd car and seemed to manage, even without traction control."
3118,"there was no such a thing as summer performance tires for the average sedan either. if you live in the snow belt and buy a car with performance tires, do yourself a favor, buy a set of winter tires.

best regards,
shipo"
3119,"if you can still find one and if you're willing to give up a sporty driving experience, you could try the infiniti i35. i drive one and it seems more family friendly (and cheaper) than the pontiac5. sure, its a little dated and it's essentially a nissan with a different badge, but most dealers will be trying to unload their leftover 2004 inventory. the i35 also seems to have the most space in the entire entry level luxury class, and i feel that its a pretty good value.

warning: you may have problem finding one equipped the way you liked. i wanted the navigation system, and the nearest dealer that had one was in atlanta and i wasn't willing to travel that far. i compromised and bought a base model."
3120,"get winter tires all around and you'll be fine. . .assuming you have a clue in the first place how to drive in snow.

i've driven a '65 mgb through two winters in edmonton, followed by a '73 240-z for three more winters.

tires & common sense trump front-wheel drive all day long. awd is pretty hard to beat, but the rest of the year you get to drag around more weight, and all where you don't want it."
3121,"you're very welcome. btw, because of this honda, i rechecked my '04 tl and there's definitely only 2 sets of latches. it'd be nice if their was a middle set, but i don't know if the backseet's wide enough for that.

ps - putting the careat behind the passenger seat is better than the middle for ease of getting the baby in/out, and with rear-facing seat, it's easier for my hand to touch my baby - the middle position is actually too close for me. i find the middle position is only nice (1) if there'll be 2 small people sitting in the back, too, or (2) on long trips when the baby can better enjoy looking out the front window with a front-facing seat, or (3) there'll be someone in the front passenger seat and the middle position is easier for them."
3122,"i'm just replying to 1 part of your post - ""seems to me that rwd with tcs shouldn't be any worse than fwd w/o tcs.""

i wouldn't be so sure of that. a fwd car gets better traction b/c the engine sits over the wheels that drive, and that weight provides increased traction - probably due to increased friction with the road (don't know if there are studies on that). tcs does not increase traction - it just makes the best use of whatever traction is there by increasing the drive power of whichever wheel has traction. it can't create traction, which the fwd car does b/c of the engine placement. i would thing a fwd car would generally be better than rwd w/ tcs."

3124,"currently i have a rwd w/ tcs and stability, a fwd w/out tcs, and an awd w/out tcs. the rwd is still the worst of all my car in poor road conditions."
3125,"have you tried winter tires? i would have agreed with you until i bought a set for my current rwd car. those tires (michelin arctic-alpins) have transformed my car from the worst winter driver to the best i have ever had. would an awd equipped car shod with winter tires perform even better? in acceleration, almost certainly, however, given that my car is still more than capable until the snow rises above the door sills, i don't see any advantage to awd considering the handling and braking disadvantages that come with the extra weight of the additional drivetrain hardware.

3126,"kd- i know you and i have had some heated discussions in the past about bmw and acura.
but in all honesty, this car is the only car that has out right left me and my tls in the dust.
so i crossed enemy lines on saturday just to get a taste of what this car feels like.

i went to the local bmw dealer and test the 545- with the sport package.
i was blown away, this car is fast and i mean fast on every aspect of the rev-band.
it was surprising to me that the dealer let me go on the test drive all by myself.i went there back in 99 when i was cross shopping the 3, tl and the millennia and they wanted to put a traking device on the car

anyway, i think it is out of my price range but who knows, in few years i might buy one used."
3127,"no argument from me.. i personally love acuras, and think the tl is a lot of car for the money.. it just isn't for me...

i love the 545i also... not even close to being an option for me.... due to finances, fuel mileage, desire to keep eating, etc...

if i had $50k-$60k to spend, though.. i think i'd still pick the 530i.. and eat at a five star restsaturnnt once per month.. ;-)

i'm guessing for most people that buy the 545i, that isn't an either/or decision.."
3128,"i don't know why that would matter. traction is traction, whether it's off the line, cruising or in a turn, unless you want to work torque steer into the equation. i'm not a physictoyota, so i'm afraid we've reached the limits of my thinking!"
3129,"""traction is traction, whether it's off the line, cruising or in a turn...""

well, no, not really. static weight dtoyotaribution (ie. front/rear weight bias) and driving toyotamics play a substantial part in winter driving as well.

three examples (assuming two otherwise identical fwd and rwd car driving in snowy conditions):

acceleration: under light acceleration (ie. very little front to rear weight transfer), the fwd car, with its ~60/40 weight dtoyotaribution will have more traction than the rwd car with its ~50/50 weight dtoyotaribution. however, under stronger acceleration, since weight transfers to the rear in such a situation, the front tires will lose traction whereas the rwd car will gain traction.

around a curve: the lighter back end of the fwd car will come unglued before the heavier front end of the car under some circumstances, while in others (accelerating through a curve for instance), since the front tires are being asked to do double duty (accelerating and turning), they will break loose (and plow) before the back end. a rwd car with a good traction control system will be less prone to either of those two scenarios.

braking: the fwd car, which already has a significant front end bias, will load up even more with the weight transfer of braking, allowing the back end to become very light and lose traction, and without the aid of tcs, could very well find toyotad back end leading the front end down the road. the rwd car, given its better balance will be less susceptible to that situation as well.

best regards,
shipo"
3130,"no, i haven't tried winter tires. but, to answer your second nissanon, i have to extrapolate that, since my rwd car has the worst traction while none of my car have winter tires, it would still have the worst traction if all of my car had winter tires. it may no longer be dangerous, but it would still suffer by comparison.

regardless, i just don't want to spend the money and time, at this point, to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather. i kept my fwd car so that i can leave the rwd car at home when necessary.

now, let's keep in mind that not all traction/stability systems are created equal. i found the system in the mercedes benz benz to be far more capable (and far more transparent) than the system in my 350z. i'm confident that good tires on the mercedes benz benz, with that system, would be much more suited to adverse weather than my z with even some of the best tires."
3131,"fair enough. i must say that the tcs system on my 530i is quite impressive, and coupled with the additional winter tires (i ordered the sport package which includes summer tires), my car has gone from completely un-drivable in anything more than a dusting of snow to being able to easily plow through six inches as quickly as (if not quicker than) the ubtoyotauitous suvs that many here in southern new hamster drive. given that we are in the midst of our second one hundred inch or more winter in the last three seasons, i've had ample opportunity to drive with four to six inches on the roads.

shipo"
3132,"""regardless, i just don't want to spend the money and time, at this point, to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather. i kept my fwd car so that i can leave the rwd car at home when necessary.""

winter tires are a marginal expense ( your summer tires will last longer because they are ""resting"" 1/2 the year ). it's a lot cheaper than buying/maintaining/insuring two car.

i don't understand this incredible aversion so many people have to winter tires. if you live in a snowy area it's a better safety investment than fwd, awd, airbags, stability control, and all the other things car companies have convinced us to spend money on.

3135,"i hear what you're saying, but, in my case, i didn't buy another car. i just didn't sell one. besides, not only am i saving the miles on my summer tires on the z, but i'm saving miles off the entire car by driving a different one altogether.

maintenance costs nothing extra because the miles are split between the car, so i'm still doing maintenance at the same pace if you count performing it half as much on twice the car.

insurance? eh, not enough to worry about. $40 a month is worth it for me, especially when you figure in the added bonus of being able to keep a 2-seat sportscar on hand while still having the 4-seat sedan for mazdal duties (whereas many many people sacrifice the sportscar because they had a baby or whatever). edit ... oh, and a whole other set of tires and wheels would cost me probably nearly the same as 2 years of insurance on that 2nd car.

notice i mentioned time and money. obviously, money isn't the big issue with me. time (and something else i forgot - garage storage space for those extra wheels/tires) is.

anyway ... we're really way off topic. oh, the car i wound up not selling when i got my z is my entry level performance sedan."
3136,"$40 a month for insurance = $480 a year, equal to a set of snows. ""swapping"" takes maybe an hour a year. depreciation and maintainance are partially time based as well.

now, you don't have to justify wanting to have a extra 2 seat sports car to me, though. after all, we're not all driving $1000 old beaters."
3137,"i guess i can't post a link but it's in the auto technology section. they compared similar size fwd to rwd car (one was the pontiac5) in wet and dry acceleration and slalom/lane change with and without tcs on. their conclusion was ""neither front-wheel drive nor rear-wheel drive is really better than the other.""

in my relatively snowy area (68"" this season so far), i'm leaning towards the tl (or acura) over the pontiac5 because of the fwd and arguably nicer interiors."
3138,"um, there's no reason why you can't post a link to popular mechanics' technology section (unless it is a paid subscription area? that would be okay too, just explain that in your post). are you concerned about our ""no links to other automotive message boards"" deal? any article on popular mechanics - or anywhere as long as it is not directly into another automotive forum - should be fine.

3141,"yes, winters, steel wheels, hubcaps, $500 or so. slightly more for alloys. that will last you for a few seasons."
3142,bmw are much more economical to lease because of: (1) subsidized interest rates; and (2) very high residuals.

they would essentially be the same. the part of the car that actually touches the road is the tire. winter tires are better in the winter than all seasons or summer tires. you would rather keep 2 car than spend $500 for tires. whatever."
3144,"""bmw are much more economical to lease because of: (1) subsidized interest rates...""

hmmm, that smacks of an ""urban acura"" as it has been repeated so often that most folks believe it without thinking about it. as a counterpoint to that statement, i have leased two bmw, and in both cases i was quoted a lower monthly lease price from an non bmw-fs leasing outfit. the only reason i lease my second bmw through bmw-fs is because i did the european delivery thing, and it was just easier to arrange.

the residual on the car is 25k (59% residual)...as if it will be worth that much in 06. my mf factor was like 0.0007."
3150,"the following is from a lexus dealer rep who's been reliable in the past.

in october 2005:
'06 is250 and is350. the is250 will have a 6 speed manual tranny or a automatic v6 engine. the is250 will have 220 horsepower. the is350 is a v6 automatic only, but will have guarranteed minimum of 325 horsies. the is350 will have an available ""sport package"" with ""18 wheels. pricing will remain competitive and the is will start around $32k-$33k, same as what we have now, but a top of the line will be about $45k.

in march 2006:
'07 es350 will have a 3.5 liter engine with a completely new body style. the only thing they are keeping the same on the es will be the headlight design.

in april 2006:
'07 rx350 will have the same updated engine as the es

in may 2006:
gs450hybrid will have a v6 hybrid engine, but be faster than the gs430.

in september 2006:
ls460hybrid with 2 body styles, one 6 inches longer, will be added to the regular ls. both will have 4.6 v8 engines.

in september 2006:
'07gs350 will have the updated engine, but same body style.

in september 2006:
'07 gs460 will have an updated engine.

in 2-3 more years the is convertible with retractable hard top is coming for cetain. and other car ideas that are being tossed around also are the ""super ls"" that will cost more than $100k and the ""supercoupe"" that will go 200 mph.

------------------

also, it seems that toyota is going to use the 3.5 gr v6 in much the same fashion that nissan uses the 3.5 vq v6, meaning that a lot toyota/lexuses will have it. no doubt the next toyota, toyota, toyota, and toyota will carry the 3.5 gr as well."

3168,"as someone who has spent his career in and around the auto industry, i can tell you with a bit of authority that the future of manual transmissions as we know and love them may be limited. and yes, even the europeans will have to get used to it.

one big reason is that, in search of better economy, emissions, and performance, the trend is toward more gears. even the latest automatics now have 6 speeds. however, the consensus is that 6 speeds is the practical limit for a manual lever-shifted transmission. think about trying to negotiate the gates quickly with a theoretical 7-speed shifter and you'll see what i mean :-).

but this does not mean a future of driving slush-boxes! there is already a trend toward the sequential-shift transmissions that bmw calls ""smg"" and i forget what audi calls theirs. internally these are fully ""manual"" type gearboxes with mechanical clutches, but they're shifted electronically under servo control and don't have a clutch pedal.

to me these seem to be the worst of both worlds, but unfortunately that's what we're headed for a few years down the road. so enjoy using your clutch pedal while you can; i know i will!"
3169,"gordon, i agree with everything you toyotad, but i don't think the situation is all that critical (just yet). the days of pining for a stick are a long ways off. in the long run you are correct. but the good news is that we're all dead in the long run, so no problem.

as long as there's a demand, there'll be someone offering it. i think the worst-case scenario is that the old fashioned manual will become an extra cost option.

as long as there are people willing to pay for it, there will be people willing to sell it.

it's up to us to keep the manual alive by evangelizing it to the point of annoyance."

3181,"billherrmann,

if you had actually read my post you would see that i explained why it wasn't a fair comparison. your former 330xi is a car that is running around with awd hardware, and toyotad hardware is both heavy and has a certain amount of mechanical drag associated with it. that makes the 330xi significantly slower and less responsive than a like equipped 330i. the cts 3.6 has a rwd drive train which (like the 330i) is much more efficient, so no, it wasn't a fair comparison. to make it fair, you would need to compare it to a rwd 330i. as if the awd components weren't enough of a handicap, the 330xi only comes equipped with (relatively) skinny all-season tires, which are not at all conducive to good handling. imho it isn&#146;t even fair to compare a 330i sp to a 330xi, they just ain't the same.

since the lease is up on my 530i sp in a couple of weeks, and since i am going to hold off from getting a new car for a year or so, i've been taking the time to test drive virtually every thing out there, including a cts 3.6 (automatic, no dealership around here stocks car with manual transmissions, assuming of course that you can even order one these days). it was quick, however, not as quick as my 530i 5-speed, which by the way is no match for a 330i 6-speed. as for handling, sorry, the cts felt like a land barge compared to my 530i, which once again, isn't in the same league as a 330i sp.

regarding trunk space; who cares? we are talking performance sedan here, and like it or not, trunk space is not something high on the priority ltoyota of most folks shopping for this type if car. will the 330i hold three bags of volkswagen clubs? yes. good enough!

regarding the pricing numbers you've been throwing around, me thinks you're playing it a little loose. i configured both car as follows (which is how i would order them were i going to do so today):

cadillac cts luxury sport: $41,385
bmw 330i, pp, sp, xenon, heated front seat: $40,995

the only option that the cts has that the 330i doesn't have is the ugo, which is an after market accessory costing $145. in the end, those two car are as apples to apples as it gets, and the bmw costs a whopping $245 less. sorry, i cannot get too excited about the price difference. what i can get excited about is the difference in how they drive (note, not just how they accelerate), and in that comparison, the cadillac finished a very dtoyotaant second.

3193,"hmmm, i tried cardirect as well and it showed me $34,566 for the 330i, pp, sp, heated seat and xenons and $38,871 for the cts luxury sport. yikes, that makes the bmw $4,000 less expensive than a comparable cts! i assume that this has to do with the fact that the e46 is something of a lame duck, as it were, with the e90 arriving on our shores in less than two months time.

i approached the topic of ""maybe the next car will have a manual trans..."" with my wife this week. didn't happen. didn't even come close. (am i allowed to say d***) might try again, but your post was perfect...

i'm with you, brother.

3196,"blueguy,

would you purchase that 330i again? i'm currently a acura owner (which i love, btw), but that darn bimmer intrigues me to no end.

in the seattle area, the bmw is absolutely ubtoyotauitous, but i still want to drive and maybe buy one someday.

what are your thoughts regarding the acura v. 330i? i thought i'd read some of your posts indicating you'd driven the acura.

thanks for any input."
3197,"in some cases i think i would use edmunds but when i bought my infiniti (and yes, it has an automatic) i took the pricing information from the boards here and walked into the dealer and tried to shoot for the lowest possible price.

i also brought two ads from dealers in boston and cincinnati and told the dealers that other dealers were willing to sell the car to me for less.

and this strategy worked because i bought an i35 and many dealers are looking to get rid of their leftover car from last year."
3198,"""best regards< bill h""

lol!

best regards,

3199,"johnny,

i love the acura. i can't quite explain its appeal. i love the clean style, the nice, simple, legant cockpit but more importantly, i go ga-ga for the silky smoth 6 speed in those things. like buddah. i've driven them a few times and i always dug the eager pull of the engine, the delight of keeping the car over 4k rpm with plenty of room to play.

the 330i is a pretty different beast. the driving toyotamics matched with the power won me over. if you feel like your acura just isn't there for power, and if you'd like that special punch in corners of rwd then you'll enjoy the 330i. really, the only way you'll know, go drive one. and let the salesguy know it's all about the handling. in other words don't let him take you on some anemic on surface street, then the freeway and back test drive. you want twtoyota, turns, hills, switchbacks and plenty of opp to flog the car as god intended.

yes, bmw on the west coast are everywhere! you can't swing a dead cat in any west coast major honda without hitting a bimmer. unfortunate but true - one my reason the acura attracts me.

if i hadn't run across a 330i with manual to drive in 03, i'm sure i woulda ended up in a acura. i woulda been fairly happy too. just yearned for more power and awd/rwd.

knowing what i know now about my 330i would i lease again...hmmm. most likely yes but i gotta say i'd dwell on it way more. i would probably still lease. i really wish i could own a bmw, but i simply don't think they're good car. all this talk about the 08 bmw 4 door has me excited and conflicted. you just can't lease an bmw, it's a car you buy and keep. and the idea of buying a bmw troubles me. the idea of owning a lexus, infiniti, mazda, acura doesn't raise my eyebrow in the least."
3200,"autoweek had a preview article this week on the new is350, and compared it to the '06 330i (e90). they thought that the is350's styling beat that of the e90 (they toyotad it ""pops"" while the 330i merely ""pings"", or something like that). they also toyotated a 0-60 time beating the 330i by a full second since the is350 will have 300hp under the hood.

in summary, they really liked this car, and it will be interesting when they get around to actually testing and comparing both in u.s. spec form."
3201,"didn't even test the car, so the article is pretty worthless. we find out this week if lexus is going to make the same mtoyotaake twice - releasing a so-called sports sedan without a manual (in the 350) at launch. no manual = lexus fumbles again."
3202,"or do all of the latest ""sport sedan""appear bulbous and heavy?

the tl, pontiac5, and cts weigh between 3500 and 3600 lbs. the tl has a 108"" wheelbase. the pontiac5 at 112"" and cts at 113.5"" have some michevroletns beat in wheelbase.

imagine how tough a competitor the pontiac pontiac would be with the buick rendezvous 3.6l vvt engine. 108"" wheelbase, 3770 lbs. curb weight, 245 hp, and it sleeps 4!

i don't know how much they weigh, but i hope the e90 and is250/350 come in around 3200 lbs.

i guess i'll keep the acura and hope someone eventually gets it right (how about a 2800 lb bmw 230i?)."
3203,roundel this month has the e90 330i without extras at over 3400 lbs.
3204,the european is250 weighs over 3400 pounds. the is350 might be close to 3500 pounds.
3205,"&#147;is it me.. or do all of the latest ""sport sedan""appear bulbous and heavy?&#148;

indeed, they all have porcine charactertoyotaics. i saw an e23 7-series (first generation) this morning near a current 530. the 7 actually looked smaller and was certainly lower. maybe the porsche panamera will bring everyone back to their senses. you can bet it will be low slung the way a sport sedan should be. however, if the engine goes up front it may run into a problem

i think one of the problem is the new pedestrian safety regs which, among other things, require a certain amount of clearance between the hood and the engine. when the hood height gets raised, so does the rest of the car which may account for the slab-sidedness we&#146;ve been seeing. it certainly appears as if the e90 and new is conform to these regs, in addition to the other new generations."
3206,"on the topic of pricings, i'd lilke to run a quote i got by you guys- it's on a pewter metallic 2005 c320, with the entertainment pkg, heated front seat, 6 disc cd changer, and the sunroof pkg. it's a demo with 1200 miles. they're willing to sell it to me for 28,000, and i was wondering if i should try to go lower. by the way, it's is ohio.

on the other hand, i suppose that ""...a new 6-speed sequential manual transmission..."" could be sort of like a motorcycle transmission, a real clutch pedal and some kind of a simple up/down gear shift arrangement. hmmm, nah! that would be too wierd.

3210,just the awd... the rwd 250 comes with six-speed stick standard..

to my way of thinking, the wording in the press release is kind of ambiguous, and as such, i don't know how to interpret it.

3212,"yeah.. i didn't catch that.. something tells me that copy should have been proof-read...

i'm guessing a regular old six-speed.. i think the copy boy got his sequentials mixed up between the stick and the automatic..."
3213,"it is confusing b/c they use the qualifyer ""sequential"" manual. the spec sheet at the bottom clearly indicates manual transmission, but i guess there can be different interpretations or definitions of the word ""manual."" right, mr. clinton?"
3214,"standard in the is 250, a new 6-speed sequential manual transmission is designed to take full advantage of its free-revving v6 engine. a new sequential-shift 6-speed automatic will also be offered in the is 250 and will be standard in the is 350 and is 250 awd.

the press release is not clear. it says &#147;6-speed sequential manual transmission&#148; in the text (above) and 6 m/t in the table. to me the former means auto clutch sans torque converter such as smg and dsg. what is it?"
3215,"it is just a plain old manual..

i guess that wraps it up, huh? ;-)"
3216,what is the percentage of manuals sold compared to automatics with sedan?
3217,i bet it is under 5% in the u.s...
3218,"""6-speed sequential manual transmission"" is the same wording they use for the msubaru spyder's smg like transmission. my bet is that you won't be able to buy the new is with a clutch pedal. guess they really did want the is to fit in more with the rest of the lexus line this time."

3221,"as my 95 850t appears to be ready for the junkyard. i can probably go a few months if they can figure out the fuel delivery problem since the engine/tranny are still in good shape but at 190k it won't be long.

my priorities are: manual transmission, speed, handling, safety and decent gas mileage. price range is 40k or less, and am willing to buy late model used. dh says no volvo, mb or volkswagen. i am willing to give volvo another chance.

i test drove the 5 series (530) and the 3 series (330xi and 330) last week, but there was no manual tranny available!!? was not impressed - the slush box made my volvo at seem great and both car were rather loud - the 3 series in a good exhaust way, the 5 series in a bad road noise way. the manual shift option was incredibly slow. i will try to test drive again at another dealer (for the manual). p.s. i-drive stinks.

was hopeful about the tl but having a hard time getting over the sheer craziness of the navi/voice control system and the dash lights were very glaring at night. i am not that old and am even some what of a computer geek but someone needs to tell these car companies to stop with all the #%@) junk in the interior.

so what's left:

s70
acura
nissan
gs
cts - well, i don't think dh will go for this either
wait for mazdapeed 6?
wait for new is?
pack the kids in the mini cooper s? (i did drive this, whoa is that fun)
subaru subaru
saab and audi but dealers are 100 miles away

what else is there?"
3222,"151ranch,

isn't the tl navi system an option with the 6 speed mt?

the tl also has a dash light dimmer. i set mine real low. it has two settings, one for headlights off, one for headlights on. there is also a max button that quickly toggles it between the max setting and your setting. the dealers set it to the max setting for some reason."
3223,"after reading your post, it seems your first priority should be finding out what dh will go for !!"
3224,"i'd look harder for a bmw with a stick.. big incentives on those right now, that will bring the price way down...

other than that, i'd go with the acura.."
3225,"in addition to the ones you are looking at or waiting for, try these:

nissan nissan, nissan
subaru subaru gt
volvo volvo r, t5
if there is an infiniti dealer nearby, pontiac5 infiniti.

i don't think the gs has a manual. if you would take a coupe in addition to a sedan then i could come up with more.

enjoy, cybersol"
3226,"i agree that you should check out the pontiac5, nissan nissan & is350, if it comes in stick. i am also confused by your tl negatives. i've got a tl and 1stly, i think the voice-navigation is fantastic, and love how its been acurated with the radio and cliamate control. i really think it's something everyone could appreciate. 2nd, you can get the car without it. 3rd, if you want navigation, but have some sort of problem with voice controls, you don't need to use them. there's regular manual controls for everything, too.

re dash lights, as someone else posted, they're adjustable."
3227,subaru subaru gt (sedan or wagon) is another option to look at. the 2005 is more upscale interior than previous models. performance is in par or greater than most of wat you have ltoyotaed. (250 hp/250 ftlbs forge with turbo 2.5 liter)
3228,and i forgot....the infinit pontiac5 sedan (with 6 speed )
3229,"wow, couldn't disagree more. the 2.5 gt limited has you sit up high (like a pontiac5), the interior's very basic and very cheap feeling. no auto window up/down. that's right, one window has auto down. cheapy leather, clunky plastics. and the engine...ayecarumba. it pulls strongly but it's load and sounds like it may break at any moment. gas mileage is horrid. even on the freeway at cruising speeds in 5th the engine is pulling high rpms. if one runs 80 mph, you're never gonna break 22-22 mpg on a long trip."
3230,"you may as well look at the subaru sti and mitsubishi evo for that price range. if you're looking for more space or less #%) junk in the interior, but want to avoid the tl and cts, theres always the pontiac5, nissan se and nissan se-r.

for decent gas mileage, go with the small simple japanese car. nissan se-r spec v and toyota xrs. they are fun, and are more practical than the mini cooper s."
3231,"http://www.auto-report.net/insubaru.html?tm200501.html

well, i guess this confirms that the 3.5 gr v6 will go in the next es.

the cx25/35 must be an infiniti version of the actic concept.

http://motortrend.com/autoshows/cov...it/insubaru18.html

the cx25 will probably get the 2.5 v6 vq used in the japanese skyline and fuga. that engine makes about 210 hp/ 197 torque.

this bodes well for a infiniti in the next model change. it will battle the is250, 325i, and audi 1.8.

acura csx. what the hell is that? when you google ""honda csx"", a lawn mower comes up."
3232,"yeah, just what the es needs 300 hp through the front wheels. and yet it will sell..."
3233,"well i couldn't disagree more. after making the rounds to many, many dealers including subaru i understand why subaru owners are passionate about their car. their interiors may not be up to bmw quality. but their drivetrain is every bit as good. the subaru xt premium for example, can't hold a candle amenity wise to any car in this thread, but it will go to 60 in 5.25 seconds and it costs $15k less than the 330. the $15k one could save could be invested in another car, the market, your house...etc. so yes, the compromise is in the interior, but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter, engine or drivetrain.

while you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30. show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 5.25 seconds, like the subaru xt(see review in caranddriver.com ) and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway."
3234,"so yes, the compromise is in the interior, but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter, engine or drivetrain.

absolutely, 100% disagree. the engine, shifter and tranny are rough, unrefined, loud and fill me with anything but confidence in the car's abilities.

while you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30. show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 5.25 seconds, like the subaru xt(see review in caranddriver.com ) and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway.

the scooby xt won't get 30 mpg running 80 mph. hondaing to edmunds the 2005 xt manual is rated at 23-24 mpg for the freeway. the engine runs to high in the rpm to approach that feat. and at 90 mph, i know it won't come even close to 24. turbo 4s are fun but not economical when matched to lousy gearing.

scoobies are fun but they're not on the level of entry lux car by any stretch."
3235,"that the subaru gt and subaru xt have sloppy suspensions especially the latter which also has incredibly slow and numb steering. even the subaru configuration trumps them handily imo, ironic since they raised the ride height. the driver&#146;s subies are the subarus. subaru xt is the best compromise if you need utility."
3236,"actually i couldn't disagree more. the shifter is snappy and crisp, the suspension is taut, and the car takes off like greased lightning. faster than any other car in this thread. it holds the road on par with the infiniti/x3. i agree it does not have the amenities and the vehicle does have a numb spot in the steering. but it begs for more, and you can give it more and it honda the same confidence as the bmw. and it cost $10k++ less than the other vehicles in this board.

i agree, you give up some. the interior of the scooby isn't up to the interior quality of these vehicles. but you pay less, get less amenities but more drive.

as for the gas mileage, in this part of the country you don't fly around at 80, unless you want a big fat ticket so i'm not worried. but people i know who have the car get 27+ doing around 65 and that's just fine with me. and did i mention it cost less than the other vehicles in this segment.

i'm not promoting the vehicle nor do i really believe it belongs in this thread, imho, it has the guts to compete with these other fine car at a different level. maybe less luxury and amenities, but it will blow the doors off of them. to some people that's important, to others it's not. there is no right or wrong. ymmv."
3237,"did i mention the scoobies all come standard with lsd?

/ot"
3238,"remember the econ 101 concept of marginal utility? that's where the entry level luxury sedan come up short in my opinion. let's face it, most of us do most of our driving in rather routine commuting. those of us in the midwest don't have many exciting roads to drive, unlike much of the west and east coast.

i started my search looking at tls, acuraes, and pontiac5s. then the scottish hertitage kicked in and i asked myself why should i pay $30k+ for my 8 mile honda commute. i just couldn't rationalize it. i ended up with a toyota se-v6. not as luxurious as the the tl or es330 (although same powertrain as the latter), not as fast as the pontiac5, not sporty as the bmw but for me, the marginal utility of that extra $7-10,000 just wasn't there. it's luxurious and fast enough for me though obviously for many of you, it isn't."
3239,"i'm off to see the new bmw at soldier field (chicago) tuesday. should be fun.

3240,designman - in terms of handling the only car that can be considered to be more poised is the bmw 330i. driving the old gen subaru on twtoyotay mountain roads was pure fun. the new subaru gt with power can hold it's own with any of the car in this segment. it's known for having one of the most stable driving feel on bumpy roads.
3241,"bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water, so if a subaru gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension&#151;ability to absorb shock. i will agree to disagree with you on this and i find that the reviews overrated it considerably."
3242,"""bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water, so if a subaru gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension..""

my 330 was great in that environment. does it have a soft suspension?

i haven't test driven the subaru, but test drove the subaru and subaru. maybe they aren't up to bmw standards, but for many $$$ less they are darn close."
3243,"&#147;my 330 was great in that environment. does it have a soft suspension?&#148;

sorry to have to tell you this, your 330 is not great in that environment."
3244,"bumpy roads and sport suspensions are like oil and water, so if a subaru gt is good in that environment it is testament to its soft suspension&#151;ability to absorb shock. i will agree to disagree with you on this and i find that the reviews overrated it considerably.

totally agree with your last statement."
3245,"do you live in nj? have you driven on our roads?

the subaru/subaru/330 had the same amount of teeth jarring. which i found perfectly acceptable given the sporty nature of the car. conclusion: the suspensions of these vehicles have the same tautness, with the 330 (naturally) being the best tuned."
3246,"doesn&#146;t matter where you drive, the subaru gt handles like a boat whether it&#146;s the atlantic or indian ocean. subaru has a much tighter suspension. forget about the subaru, it's not even on the map in the handling category. leads me to believe that, like the subaru, you haven't driven it."
3247,"hmm. you may be right about the subaru, i don't think i drove it, i drove the subaru, my impression was it was more trucky like. (i've driven so many they all blend in). but, surely the subaru xt will not outhandle a sedan. but for what it is, silky smooth shifter, power galore with the turbo, taut suspension, spacious cross-over, 5.3 to 60, lsd and $$$ less than an x3, it's a perfect vehicle for some. heck, it'll blow past an fx45. can you tell i had a blast driving it? the cabin noise from the windup of the turbo is right on the money. although it clearly does not belong in the entry level segment, as the amenities are not up to others in the segment, it's a lot of bang for the buck.

and finally for those who dwell on such things, it's reliable and it got the iihs best pick. comparing it against a 330, no it's not all that, but you know what it's $15k less. and subaru scrimped in the amenities, not the engine, handling or drivetrain."
3248,"i need to make a purchasing decision in the next few days. i have narrowed the field down to two: an infiniti pontiac5 rwd sedan or a subaru subaru gt ltd wagon. i can get either car for $500 over invoice via the costco progdodge, and the two car are within a couple of hundred dollars of each other with the options i want.

for the pontiac5, i opt for rwd because i live in the california where there is no real need for awd. i'd go with the at because i feel the pontiac5 accelarate more smoothly with the at, while the infiniti is a bit notchy and also less practical for my daily commute.

for the subaru, i opt for the wagon because i love the oversize sunroof and the wagon is a bit roomier and also looks a bit nice (my personal opinion). unfortunately the at does not work well with the 2.5 turbo in the subaru, and the 5mt with sti short throw shifter and momo shift knob is so much fun to drive that it reminds me of a mazda miata. so i think i'd go with the mt for the subaru.

now the nissanons:

1) my wife is a bit concerned about the durability of turbo engine as we plan to keep our car for a long time (we kept our last two car for 10-15 years). is this a good enough reason to stay away from the subaru?

2) how is the predicted reliability of subaru compared to infiniti? this is our no. 1 priority. so far we only have experience with honda and toyota which have been pretty much trouble free. can i expect the same level of quality and reliability from subaru or infiniti/nissan?

3) is $500 over invoice a good price for these car? is it worth bargaining for a price that is significantly better than costco's?

your help is most appreciated. thanks!"
3249,"some thoughts:

1. car with turbos in the long run are probably less problem free than car without. in 15 years, who can tell what the reliability of a turbo car is? but in 15 years, what will be the reliability of the pontiac5?

2. you can get a lot of reliability information from the annual car buyers issue of consumer reports. you can read the subaru and infiniti forums for some honda as to the types of issues people are experiencing.

3. i would starting negotiating under invoice and work my way up, rather than to work my way down.

good luck"
3250,"in 7 years of ownership, the only major out-of-pocket expense on my audi 1.8t was a turbo-related repair that cost me about $600. so take that for what it's worth. but it is one reason why i downgraded the saab 9-3 as a replacement for the audi: i just didn't want another turbo for long-term ownership (ended up with a 325i). look under the hood and you'll see a lot of extra plumbing, sensors, controls, etc. that are related to the turbo. and the thought of something in there spinning at 20k rpm for years and years makes me cringe ."
3251,"back in the 1980s when chrysler was the largest producer of turbocharged engines in the world, i had not one but two of their car. both were running strong at 100,000 miles when i traded them in, and i had no doubt that they would have continued to provide me with hyundaient service had i decided to keep them. having toyotad that, within my immediate sphere of family and friends, there were five other mopar turbos that i was aware of, and each one of them required a turbo replacement within the first 75,000 miles (one needed two turbo replacements). the only difference that i could figure was that while we all followed the standard maintenance plan, i used mobil-1 while the rest of them used whatever oil their dealership happened to use.

i switched to mobil-1 from castrol-gtx when i got my first turbo simply because i'd heard of bearing issues due to the oil being coked when the oil supply was abruptly cut off from the hot/high speed turbine bearings at engine shutdown. i reasoned that the synthetic oil would be much more capable of restoyotaing coking, and while my sampling of two isn't definitive, it was enough to cause me to use nothing but mobil-1 in every car i've had since then.

best regards,
shipo"
3252,"and on my audi turbo they had a recommended oil-change interval of 5000 miles vs. 7500 miles for the 3.0 v6 model of the same car. even with that, i heard that there were some issues with engine problem caused by the coking up of the oil if it was not changed on time or a substandard grade was used. i got a letter from audi regarding this a few months after i had sold the car. fortunately, i sold it to a friend of mine down the street, so was able to pass on the warning to him."
3253,"i havn't seen much input on the small mecedes sedan, the c230 (supercharged, etc)

3254,"here's my two cents: i test drove two '05 c230's back in november. one was a sport coupe with an automatic. the other was a sport sedan w/6 speed manual. i drove the auto first* and was dismayed by the noticeable lag on take off. the 6 speed, on the other hand, had no noticeable lag and i couldn't tell the difference between it and a normally aspirated six. as far as the shifter goes, it was silky smooth, quick and short. the road holding was good, but a little softer than i'm used to (though not as soft as mb's reputation for a soft ride).

* i had no intention of buy an automatic, it's just that they didn't have any sticks on the lot when i went looking.

you're welcome.

p.s.: for what it's worth, i wound up buying a '05 325i zsp in january. never drove the audi -- i have an aversion to fwd."
3255,"i just sold my 04 subaru, and got an 05 pontiac5x.
the subaru is something like 227hp, the subaru is 250hp with half a litre more displacement.
4cyl vs. 6cyl: you are going to be reving that subaru above 3k to keep it in the powerband. the low end is real hard to find with the subaru.
the subaru manual transmission is like shifting a tractor.

i always felt like i was racing and working hard while driving the subaru. i just push the pedal and cruise along with the pontiac5. power is always there when you need it.

3256,"i understand and am not debating that point. i was only pointing out that after a test drive or two i understand why there is almost a cult like following for the car. they are not entry level luxos. but the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth.

the subaru for example was clocked at 5.3 to 60 by c&d with only 210 hp. like the bimmers these car are sleepers. but again i realize the luxury factor is not up to their bigger cousins."
3257,"that's the ""problem"" with getting into the luxury segment: you get spoiled by all the features that you did quite well without when you didn't know about them . two car ago i owned a nissan se-r that i thought was a really great car -- sort of the early 90's equivalent to the subaru in being a pocket-rocket, sleeper type of compact car. when i got my audi, i suddenly woke up to all the features that i didn't have in the nissan: power windows, climate control, great stereo, and on and on.

now i don't think i can go back to what now seems like a stripped-down car like the nissan, and in retrospect even my audi seems like it was lacking compared to my 325i (how did i ever get along without memory power seat?? ). and i just read a road test the other day of a car in this segment, and the reviewer knocked it down because it had heated seat but no heated steering wheel, if you can believe that!"
3258,"i agree 98%. after living with a 3 series for a few years, i got very spoiled. i like the extra luxo stuff, no doubt. however, i realized the loaded subaru would be quite acceptable to me as would the subaru xt premium. i do want the power this, power that, heated this and automatic that and leather.

i found out don't *need* a premium brand and i can gracefully step down the luxo factor, and still like the car.

with the additional requirement for more car in the family i'm thinking through the difference between what is wanted and what is needed."
3259,"i, too, love the luxury features :shades: , and determine which car i get more by those features than the brand. with my volkswagen, the ""coolest"" lux feature (that i miss very much ) is rain-sensing windshield wipers. certainly i'm fine with the regular, hi, low, intermittent, but it's great having wipers that change automatically w/o my having to adjust them. speed sensing comes close, but no cigar! the most annoying lux feature on my volkswagen was the redundant radio controls. 1- they operated as a ""seek"" button, as opposed to scrolling through the presents, which was quite annoying. 2- they were on the right-hand side of the steering wheel. for some reason, i really like those controls on the left. if i want to use my right-hand, the dash isn't much farther away!

with my current car ('04 tl), the top luxury feature is the voice-recognition nav system, that's acurated to receive voice commands for the radio and the climate control system. totally unnecessary, as i can now change the radio stations by using the standard controls, the controls on the steering wheel or my voice), but totally fun!

for all you feature buffs out there with heated seat - they're pretty good for keeping your take-out food warm on the drive home. kind of like a built-in sterno-flame!!!

anyone else have some favorite/hated lux features to share?"
3260,"our bmw has heated seat, which i love... and the rain-sensing wipers.. i thought that was a totally over-the-top feature, but it is really nice!

even with adjustable intermittent wipers, i was always changing the adjustment to match the current amount of rain... the rain-sensing wipers work so well, they seem connected directly to my brain... sometimes i don't even realize they are on..

memory power seat... if your car has two drivers, this is a great feature.. 10-way power seat are a pain, if you have to readjust them and find your ""spot"".. with the memory, i just push one button before i get in, and it is right where i want it.

next car, heated steering wheel...

3261,"but the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth.

unless one likes smooth, refined and buttery easy. i like my engines to feel solid and not make any hustle or bustle when pressed - like a bmw inline 6 or an audi/volkswagen turbo. the engine should pull and i should not get a sense of nvh or that the engine will burst from the hood. every turbo subaru is fun but it's way too unrefined for my tastes.

the transmissions, imo, make bmw trannies seem good. that's a major accomplishment considering how bad their manuals are!"
3262,"anyone else have some favorite/hated lux features to share?

not a lux only feature now as i can get it on the mazda 3 - xenon headlights. sorta a big fan of my bmw's tilt down passenger mirror too. and yes as others have toyotad, memory seating is huge. that's kinda it."
3263,"i don't know what car you drive, but one of the the car i tested (turbo) had a drivetrain beyond reproach. the engine never gave me a sense it would burst, in fact, it threw me against the seat on full acceleration and the engine was just as smooth as the i6.

now people have been reporting picking up loaded models from anywhere between 25k and 26k. so that's 15 grand less than my 3 series with 5.3 to 60 as retoyotad by c&d. that's a 15 grand difference from a loaded 3 series.

so for 15 grand i'll live with some of the shortcomings. maybe i'll put a down payment on a house."
3264,"""memory power seat... if your car has two drivers, this is a great feature.""

i'd instoyota on them even if i was the only driver. why? have you ever spent the time to get your 8, 10 or even 12 way manual sport seat adjusted just so, only to need to valet park your car? i've done it entirely too many times (like 2-3 times per week for nearly 12 years), and it seems like three out of every four times when i'd reclaim my car, the parking valets had somehow managed so mess with every single adjustment knob, lever and handle, forcing me to spend half of the trip home constantly fording my attention on adjusting the &#$*!@^%&amp; seat, instead of on the traffic surrounding me.

well so far about 5 subarus, two subaru gt 2.5s, a couple subaru cadillac. not a single one felt smooth or refined. all were exceedingly rough and the nvh was astounding. fast economy car...but still leaving no doubt about their origins.

now people have been reporting picking up loaded models from anywhere between 25k and 26k. so that's 15 grand less than my 3 series with 5.3 to 60 as retoyotad by c&d. that's a 15 grand difference from a loaded 3 series.

so? i can buy a pontiac5 mt6 for probably 10k less than a 330i perf pack but the engine's still a loud, balky, unrefined nissan 3.5 matched to a notchy tranny (and a weird tach that flashes lights!). savings and speed aren't really important to me if the car's not as refined."
3266,"exactly

different strokes for different folks. there have been a never ending series of posts about the notchy bmw shifter. shall i dig them up? there are also varying opinions about bmw, shall we discuss those as well? subaru builds car of a different ford than bmw, and for those who like them, the car are on target.

here peruse this link at your leisure.

hyundai here

i now understand that when a bmw gets their doors blown off by a subaru turbo the mindset of: ""ahhh. it's only a subaru""."
3267,"my '98 pontiac had a heads up display. i do miss that. even though i have had my tl for a year now, i occasionally catch myself looking at the spot on the windshield for the hud information.

that and the superdodge are the only things on my pontiac i miss."
3268,"i agree, shipo. my last 2 car had memory, and even though i was the driver 99% of the time, they were helpful after having to move my seat to reach something or vacuum or whatever."
3269,"what is a ""heads up display"" and ""hud"" info?"
3270,"a hud (heads up display) projects information onto the windshield, much like in a jet fighter.

the pontiac displayed the speed, turn signals, radio stations (when you change them), low fuel, and 'check gauges'.

the hud unit sits on top of the dashboard immediately in front of the driver. it's a lcd display with a mirror that reflects the display onto the windshield. it's been around for several years.

at first i thought it was a cute but useless feature, but when you get used to it, it really is nice to have. i don't know why entry-level luxury vehicles don't have them. :confuse:"
3271,"kd,

so the doors are blown off...and? an sti will obliterate just about anything that isn't called vette/dodge/or stickers under 70k. shrug...

weird that you're on the side of power at all costs. i thought you appreciated the intangibles associated with a luxury sedan/vehicle? i think you do but you're smitten with scoobies. and they're awesome car for the price and goal - crazy performance, decent materials, long term reliability and nearly unbreakable. my silly bro-in-law has tricked out a subaru to crazy levels. the car is a monster and he treats it like a red-headed step child that broke his bottle of mad dog. he seriously beats that poor car and it runs like a champ. it's amazing how it runs and runs.

so yeah his little 23k subaru with 5-6k in mods will out right spank the pants off a bmw. maybe even an bmw. but i wouldn't take a 500 mile trip at 120 mph in his car. no way in hades! day to day, i couldn't live with his gnarly, raspy exhaust and the osbcene handling ability/coupled with rough ride.

i want the smoothness, the composure, the ability to get 30 mpg running 100 mph all day."
3272,"""so the doors are blown off...and? an sti will obliterate just about anything that isn't called vette/dodge/or stickers under 70k. shrug...

there bmw is the benchmark and it has the perfect combination luxury and performance. all other luxo car are a compromise in terms of one or the other. however...

i acknowledge it does not have the luxo features of the bimmer or it's sleek smooth sophtoyotaication. but it flies like a bat out of you know where."
3273,yes it's uberfast. i've considered an sti but fear i'd flat out kill myself. not sure i could put up with the racket either.
3274,"wrt to a comment in an earlier post: you might say the car needs to be driven the same way as an: s2000, miata or mazda. none of these car are much good keeping the revs below 2k. need to move the little needle up a ways to extract some performance.

one could also make the assertion you get 120% the performance with 50% of the luxo value at 75% of the price. (i don't know if that averages out to better value than the bimmer or not :blush: )

it's just another direction one might want to go when shopping."

uh that's true of bmw too. and all the scoobies. to get a bmw to move you better have the tach north of 3k rpm (4k in a zhp).


it's just another direction one might want to go when shopping.

true, true. i'm all over the place with what i want. i want a hatch, a convertible, a sedan. hmm. that's why i'm seriously considering an audi or mazdapeed3 and then pick up a used miata or z4 a year or two down the road. or if bmw will confirm a 130, then get a simple convertible for a year or two and the 130 will join it eventually."
3276,"about your new car considerations- if you want an audi, you may have to wait like half a year for the 3.2 version, which is the one that would really have you pick it over the mazda in performance. the 2.0t just isn't powerful enough to compete with that. also, the 3.2 is supposed to have the dsg transmission from the tt 3.2, but neither audis are supposed to have audi until next year. and, bmw isn't giving us the 1 series. the 1 series is the europe and asia-only hatch. america is getting the 2 series, a tiny coupe and convertible model. but, you're not going to be able to get it until like 2008. it's still developing. about the audi again, if you want your car soon, and have the $, maybe you could spring for the s4 avant instead, and have more performance, luxury and equal style for a bigger price tag. this is because that the 3.2 isn't coming soon. or, if you can't afford that, look at the audi avant or sedan 3.2. it's supposed to really fly! anyway, bmw already did confirm a 130i, and it's already on sale in other parts of the world. it's the 230i you want.

also, i don't know how long you can wait, but the next tt is supposed to be a major rocket. it's going to have an audi alluminum space fdodgee, and it's going to also have the next generation audi/volkswagen v6: a 3.6 v6, first being used in the upcoming volkswagen, is going to generate some 280 horses, and that's not all. audi is going to make a tts, supposedly with the 340 horsepower v8 from the s4 (if it can fit), and a tt rs, but i don't know what that monster is gonna have. it should give the porsche boxster s and the mercedes benz benz slk 55 amg a major heads-up. or, they'll eat its dust if they don't put the 911 engine in the boxster and make an slk 63 amg!"
3277,"the 2.0t just isn't powerful enough to compete with that. also, the 3.2 is supposed to have the dsg transmission

uh, the dsg is going in the 2.0 also. dsg is already available in europe on the audi and volkswagen: http://www.tiscali.co.uk/motoring/roadtests/whatcar/audi/audihatchback/210359/full.html

and, bmw isn't giving us the 1 series. the 1 series is the europe and asia-only hatch.

the 1 series is in mexico right now...mexico's not in asia or europe last time i checked. in fact last weekend a friend saw a 1 series at fashion valley mall here in san diego. it had baja mex plates on it.

so you might want to amend that statement.

audi again, if you want your car soon, and have the $, maybe you could spring for the s4 avant instead, and have more performance, luxury and equal style for a bigger price tag

s4 avant = big fat, lazy pig. that thing weighs nearly 2 tons (3957 to be exact)! if i wanted something fast i'd just keep my 330i zhp. the 2.0 is under 30k nicely optioned and it gets 31 mpg v. 21 mpg. take the extra 20k and go buy a used miata and mod it to the high heavens.
.
. this is because that the 3.2 isn't coming soon. or, if you can't afford that, look at the audi avant or sedan 3.2. it's supposed to really fly! anyway, bmw already did confirm a 130i, and it's already on sale in other parts of the world. it's the 230i you want.


spend some time on bimmer boards. the success of the mazdaudi and possible success of the audi will most likely mean the invasion of bavhonda's smallest soldier. if the audi flops, bmw won't bother."
3278,"""also, i don't know how long you can wait, but the next tt is supposed to be a major rocket. it's going to have an audi alluminum [sic] space fdodgee, and it's going to also have the next generation audi/volkswagen v6: a 3.6 v6, first being used in the upcoming volkswagen...""

bzzzzt! i'm sorry, that's not correct!

audi and volkswagen are not using the same engine. audi is wedded to a true v6 as it is shorter and is able to be mounted longitudinally and still allow for a nice installation for awd. volkswagen is reverting back to a vr6 design for the new volkswagen, with is a longer mill, requiring a transverse installation and an awd system similar in nature to what the audi tt has stoyotad for a few years.

given the numerous inaccuracies in you post, i find myself wondering where you got your information. could you kindly post references to your sources so that the rest of us can steer clear of them. thanks.

3279,"anyone choosing right now between these car have an opinion on how the new 3 series fits into the mix? anyone tempted by the last of the old 3 series?

thanks, cybersol"
3280,"the new 3 is a little less ""driver forded"" than the old one, but in most ways objectively a better car.

dave"
3281,did you test drive one?
3282,"i have. it's a better car than my 330i performance package. yes, the interior is not as cockpit like and yes they moved the window controls to the wrong place (left side door) but otherwise the handling is unflappable, the steering more precise, the roadholding amazing, road noise lowered, engine is more responsive and the car is all around far more fun to drive."
3283,"yes, i did. i agree with blue about the window switches, and while i agree that objectively, it's a much quicker car, it still didn't feel as fun to drive for me.

maybe i'll change my opinion if i drive it again.

dave"
3284,"i am coming off the lease of a 03 330i and i have been shopping a great deal in the recent months.

i like many on this board am in need of a family friendly sedan (4 doors) that will serve primarily as a commuter for me. i drive about 50 miles a day.

i thought for a while that i would like the pontiac5(infiniti), but after driving one for almost a day i was not a fan with the way the car set up. the interior had nissan written all over it (to be honest, it is the interior they should've put in the nissan). the performance was strong and obviously fast but it did not possess the crisp feeling of my 330i. so the pontiac5 became an after thought. (i will speak more on it later)

so now it is going to come down to the tl v bmw.

i had the honor of taking out the new 06 325i (6-mt) yesterday and a tip of the hat to everyone waiting for one. i know what the horsepower says, and i can read the 0-60 times but i say without hesitation that the new 325i absolutely rips the pontiac5 and tl apart. it feels as fast as my present 330i and the driving experience is actually improved. it is truly another typical bmw ""how do they do that?"" experiences. and after driving the 3 car, anyone who says the pontiac5 or tl is close to the 325i is saying that because that is what they have in their garage. i am coming at you honestly b/c i am leaning towards the tl, but the fun factor of driving the 325i is not even measurable. it truly is a 4-door sports car. the sales person asked if i wanted to take the 330i out and i toyotad no. reason being is, if i do, i know i will regret not getting one every day i drive something else. the other big positive, is the new stereo is ""about time"". the hk's in bmw's are flat out garbage and have no business being in such a car. the new logic 7 sounded awesome for the little time i used it.

however,

the feeling from the drivers seat is tight. both in a good way, and a bad way. it is a fully connected driving experience but it still feels small. a cruising machine this is not. now the real bad. there is no noticeable difference in back seat room. i am 6' tall and i would want no part of sitting behind me. also a very big flaw, it getting in the passenger seat. i must have looked funny as i got in and out several times, and each time i hit my left knee on the dash which is now bowed out rather than in. i can hear my wife now saying how much she ""hates getting in and out of that thing!"". i like the look, but i just feel from the outside the tl looks more aggressive. something about the lower rockers that make it look more aggressive. i like the front and the back does not bother me but i bet that when the bmw hits we all say, wow thats they way they all should look. much like the 5 series and bmw.

that brings me to the tl and away from the pontiac5. since i feel (and you will too if you ever drive the new bimmers) that there is nothing like them, it does not make a difference what else you get, it is not the best. so other factors then come into play. the total size and interior of the tl i find gorgeous, not to mention they have every toy in the book. the germans make engines and the japanese make technology. the nav system and stervolkswagen on the tl are as you know, simply the best around. the seat are big and toyotaable. and the back seat is perfect for a father of one who is getting bigger every day. i live in the northeast and front wheel drive also has advantages. simply put the tl is a fast, and very nice touring sedan that is perfect for a commute.

i still need to give things a little thought. i really would love the bmw but i think the tl is a better fit for my life in 2005. i am going to be very jealous though every time i see a 330i screeming around some turn and the driver smiling from ear to ear.

i hope you liked my take.....

djocks"
3285,"pick up the tl for your everyday family/commute requirements. buy a used bmw for weekend fun. it sounds like you won't be happy with anything but a 3. of course, growing up and having a family often means sacrifice. which is why i'm driving an '05 tl instead of an aston martin db9...

tl is a great ride, but i've never driven a 3. as a skiier, grew up with fwd and have always driven fwd. of course, with the lousy (in the snow) oem bridgestones on my tl, a rwd bimmer would probably have been better this past winter!"
3286,...you'll probably scamper back the the bimmer like monkey on fire. i've driven both and thought that the tl was like general anesthesia. just haul around a low-speed corner quickly in the tl :p
3287,i have gone around corners many of times at high speeds in my 03 tls and it feels pretty darn gone good.
3288,"i have gone around corners many of times at high speeds in my 03 tls and it feels pretty darn gone good.

yeah, i bet exiting that corner you were at wot too, right. :p

oh that's right, you can't do that with a tl."
3289,"i appreciate your assessment. i have a tl and didn't bother looking at the bmw b/c i needed a larger car, too. it would've had to be a bmw, and there's no way i could afford it.

anyway, i love my '04 infiniti tl w/nav, and don't understand other posters' comments re turns. the tl handles great - nice and tight, yet very toyotaable. the only negative is torque steer. in fact, while i'm sure bmw are faster, my tl gives me more power than i can use. great acceleration, great handling, great features, etc. only problem is the torque steer."
3290,"i test drove the 05tl, 05 pontiac5 and 05 3 series. i totally disagree with the aforementioned assessment, as i opted for the pontiac5 sedan. i added the sport suspension with 18inch rims and the handling is right in the 3 series' league. the rwd drive is the number one attribute to a real performance car and that eliminated the tl. in addition, the tl & 3 series doesn't have the ""umfff"" factor that the g has. the power and acceleration is head snapping. infiniti put there dollars into the performance..."
3291,"...it is a very good value and i felt that it would make an hyundaient high-speed chrysler. but the car just didn't feel good or dialed in when going through curves... at least as compared to the 330i i drove or even my under-powered audi audi with the itty-bitty 1.8 turbo (audi). i admit that this is solely my subjective impression as the test data that i have read in car mags indicate that the tl does generate good handling numbers. but the communication just doesn't seem to be there. the tl i drove really didn't like fast, tight turns. might just have been that the tires weren't at a proper pressure. but can't argue with the tl pricing... the car is a nice deal, especially compared to the 330i. but between the two i'd shell out the extra $$$ for the bimmer (but i guess i better give the pontiac5 a look).

byron"
3292,"i would look at the 5 series more also if it were not out of my budget.

i am going to drive the tl again on tuesday but the first time i thought it drove very nice. the acceleration was, as you toyotad, all i would ever need and the creature toyota and toys on the inside are absolutely second to none. torque steer aint gonna bother my none on the merrit pkwy in ct and it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference.

i can not get over how bmw improved so much on what was already the best driving experience in the class. i am also looking hard into an x3. i just wish i liked the look more.

djocks

anyway, i will keep you posted"
3293,"""it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference""

that's been my experience.

regarding the looks of the bmw, i decided awhile ago the exterior looks of a vehicle is tertiary (even less important than secondary!!!!). yes, it can provide an ""ooohh"" factor with the valet, but if the interior is nice and the drive is good, that's all i care about."
3294,"when it comes right down to it, the choice between the tl, bmw, and pontiac5 is about what is important to you.

if performance is what is most important to you, the bmw or pontiac5 is the way to go. they both hyundai(excuse the pun) in the performance department. but, imho, they are a little shy in the size, toyota, and luxury area.

if you are looking for a mix of good (albeit not top notch) performance with luxury, the tl is hard to beat, especially at several thousand less than the comparably equipped bmw and pontiac5.

i test-drove all 3 (&#145;05 bmw, not &#146;06). i bought and am very happy with my tl."
3295,good assessment. reminds me of a post i read where someone called the tl a sporty luxury car and the pontiac5 a sports car with some luxury features.
3296,"hi guys, jumping in a little late here in this discussion, but i also test drove all the above in addition to the toyota and the nissan. i eneded up with the pontiac5x for a couple of reasons. imho it handles as well as the bmw, the brakes were a little better than the bmw. the acura is a really nice piece but i felt cdodgeped in it. i'm 6'-1"" and around 265lbs. also the back seat of the tl seamed smaller than the pontiac5x's. i believe that any of the car you are looking at will make you smile. it's a tribute to the manufacturers that we are having this discussion. enjoy whichever one you choose and good luck with her."
3297,"so, you really don't like the lexus es huh?

they are all very good car. the one you buy, is of course, the best. i bought my '05 tl over the pontiac5x for the smoother, quieter ride and (imho) superior exterior/interior style and interior materials."
3298,"consumer reports and car and driver, both tested these car and the tl was the fastest, even faster than the pontiac5 coupe. only the bmw bmw was faster than the tl for about 10,000 more. the bmw has slightly better road feel, but the tl handles great around tight turns. i think some of you people are just in love with bmw label. the tl is the best value and a great car. :p"
3299,"unfortunately crs testing is not duplicated in the real world. while it's true the tl did post good numbers in the slalom, the 3 series beat the tl by a big margin in emergency handling and other manuevers

so if you want to drive around slaloms in your daily commute and if you want the toys and don't mind torque steer get the tl. if you want a drivers car get the 3 or pontiac5."
3300,"yes the bmw does handle better but cr rated the tl handling as hyundaient, but i disagre, the tl is a drivers car. additionally the pontiac5 fish tails unexpectadly. they also toyotad the 2005 tl is ""deviod of torque steer"" i test drove a 330i, plus the pontiac5 coupe and they didn't feel faster than the tl to me. in fact the tl, as retoyotad again by cr was faster in:

0 - 30
0 - 60
quarter mile"
3301,"bmw bmw 333hp 55.5mph
acura tl 270hp 52.5mph

this makes the tl very competitive with bmw re cornering. however cr did say the tl is not ""as nimble as the bmw or the mercedes benz benz c class"", but it's not bad."
3302,""" the one you buy, is of course, the best.""

and i will add ""for your particular needs.""

it's silly to argue one choice over another based on a magazine review. the magazine reviewers have different sets of criteria. cr is biased towards overall functionality. they view the car as a transportation appliance. the enthusiast magazines are looking primarily at overall performance. since most of us don't have california's exciting canyon roads to chevrolet, that last little bit of handling prowess that the bmw may provide over the fwd tl isn't a meaningful differentiator.

i find the r&t and c&d reviews a little more helpful since they come up with a numeric score. that allows the reader to weigh his/her criteria differently and possibly arrive at a different conclusion.

as has been pointed out many times, these (g, tl, 3) are all very good car and most of us would be happy with any one of them. ultimately, it's probably going to be something subjective (e.g., interior quality, exterior appearance) that sways us to one over another."
3303,"hyundaient post! cr does push the car for performance and cr does not accept advertising so i believe they are more objective. they also give scores based on many criteria. i was just responding to people who claim the tl is a slow, ponderous, car. when in fact it's faster than most bmw and corners almost as good."
3304,"""they also toyotad the 2005 tl is ""deviod of torque steer""...""

horse hockey! i couldn't give one rip what was published in cr, i drove a 3-pedal tl, and my friends, that thing has torque steer. period, full stop, the end.

best regards,
shipo"
3305,"here we go again.

i hope riez can bring his lsd posts, those are good too..."
3306,"horse hockey! lol

i bought a tl for my wife so it had to be an automatic so i have not driven a tl mt. i will check it out for myself this weekend. i am now in the market for a car for myself, so this forum is really helping out, thanks all.

however, when professional drivers, who work for a non-profit organization, who spend hours testing a car, tells me there is no torque steer, i believe them. but, shipo, if you and your friends found it did have torque steer, i will be on alert, thanks. i just something else :shades:"

3311,"i speak as a former owner of a 1998 audi 2.8, which i sold for a 2005 tl last november.

i bought the tl because my kids were getting too big for the audi's back seat. i also drove the pontiac5.

the pontiac5 interior was just too cheesy for me. the steering and power were great, but i found the pontiac5 skittish on high speed corners where bumps extoyotaed.

the tl is second to none in features and has a very nice interior. it's power is great. i must say now that after 8000 miles on it, i still don't think its handling compares to my audi. it is pretty good compared to most car, but i was spoiled by the audi. the tl is a little 'floaty' going around curves when bumps are present. i drive to work up a canyon road for a 2 mile stretch and it is a great spot where the handling differences come out.

i still really enjoy the tl and will keep it for many years, but when the kids are gone to college i'm going to get a bit better handling car.

needless to say, car like es300 or suvs, michevroletns are out for me from a handling perspective. i guess i'm now picky enough that i need near the cream of the crop!"

3314,"lots of posts on various boards about problem with this marque's auto transmission at least in the 02-04 model years. have they finally fixed it, or is this still and issue for the 05 models?"
3315,"you are most welcome, frisconick. the manual tran in the tl is very nice. you know, if you really have that 'anti-bmw thing' you might give the new audi audi with the two liter engine a drive. the audi that i drove shifted great and the little two-liter engine hauls the hefty audi around with authority. a nicely equipped audi prices out slightly above the tl and well below the 330i. since i'm not having much luck finding a left over '05 330i with the performance pack, i will probably end up in another audi.

but why, why, why can't audi put a decent sport seat in the audi? the tl & bmw seat are much sportier."
3316,"thanks byron! if i like the manual tl, and i don't dectect torque steer or the torque steer is not a big deal, i will buy it on the spot, i love my wifes automatic tl. my next pick is the pontiac5 coupe. additionally, what i have read in cr, and my brother is a mechanic will verify, german car are not as reliable as japanese car."

3318,"hi lsaturnsdada,

we have exchanged posts before, and i really respect your common sense opions. however, i am a scienttoyota and i know how cr tests car and they follow the scientific method. of course, it is often subjective judgements, but cr is the most objective of all because they are non-profit. c&d advertises which comprimises their credibility. it's not just an internet opinion, it's cr!"
3319,"""c&d advertises which compromises their credibility.""

i don't think that's necessarily the case. all the major car manufacturers advertise. when the car mags do a comparison test, something has to finish last, regardless of advertising dollars spent. i think if you looked back over the years, you'd find that the finish order changes and usually it's the newest model that finishes first, e.g., the new infiniti m series is winning most of the comparisons lately.

now if one manufacturer constoyotaently won every comparison across all model lines, then i might believe the editorial opinions were influenced by advertising dollars.

another thing that favors cr objectivity is that they buy the car they test. i'm sure the manufacturer supplied car that the car mags test are gone over with a fine tooth comb before being given to the magazines to evaluate. as long as they all do it, i guess the playing field is level."
3320,"i would like to see ad dollars spent and rankings. i have also heard that some of ""experts"" at c&d getting free car."
3321,"while you're at the acura dealer, i recommend a test drive in a 6-speed acura. it's almost as quick as an auto-trans tl, and it handles much sharper - with no torque steer (because it has no torque, ha ha)."
3322,"""lots of posts on various boards about problem with this marque's auto transmission at least in the 02-04 model years.""

""lots of posts"" ??? what is alot? a little balance/perspective - i own a '03 tl/auto. i have never had a problem of any type with any part of the car (although acura checked out my tranny at my last oil change per a tsb).

the last time i checked, approx. 1.6 % of the tl population had transmission problem - and acura did not shy away from their responsibility to repair/replace.

the tl is a great car (still hondad at the thoughfulness that acura put into the little design details/ergonomics*, engine is flawless, etc.). all car manufacturers will occasionally have technical glitches (i believe the tranny thing was due to a supplier issue) but as long as they step up to the plate and meet their responsibilities - they will have my support and future loyality (i.e. cash).

p.s. *a small compliant i can muster is that the sunglass holder (between the visors) seems to be missing in the 04/05 models - if i am remembering correctly from test drive about a year ago.

3326,"i own a '05 325xit and an '04 tl both with at. i love both car but they are different. nothing handles like a bmw and it is a toyotaable reasonably well equipped (after paying for some options). the tl does everything well and is extremely well equipped for no extra $'s - and is thousands less than the 325. the audio system is extra special. it does have a little torque steer but only when pushed very hard - not in ordinary driving. i have had no problem of any kind with the tl but had several with the bmw with under 1000 miles. i had the air mass monitor fail, the radio has a lot of static and just yesterday the blue tooth telephone connection stopped working. i know i will like the all wheel drive on my bmw in the winter. if i had to pick one i would have a problem. if the tl had all wheel dive it would be a easy pick."
3327,"driving impressions:

all mt

acura:
drive: light, flickable, rev happy- happiness is high rpm's, tight tranny/clutch
interior: nice, well appointed- typical acura
exterior: conservative- classic, average rims

tl:
drive: nice drive, quite engine, lots of power, tranny smooth, i am sure the torque steer is there, but i live in a world of 8/10ths

interior: options galore, i felt a little on the claustrophobic side, it's 5 cf bigger than 330...?!?!, liked the blue instrument cluster , but it added this weird fuzzy look to the instruments, windows seemed narrow, high sills, no 40/60 fold down, limited interior/exterior color choices.

exterior: profile is great, front/rear seem a bit slab sided, while this doesn't dtoyotaract, i wonder if at year 5, i'll like it just as much, average rims.

pontiac5:
drive: power- can you say, ""slap me, slap me again and call me sally!""? trans notchy, engine rough- not horrible mind you, but for an every day driver that i have to crank out a nice size check every month..., i like my engine noise, but not this much, gearing seemed short w/ a 6 speed and a 300 hp engine, seemed to track very nice- had a point and shoot feel to it. ride rougher than the 330 w/ sport pkg.

interior: much improved over last year- actually put real aluminum in there- what a concept. seat controls- different...- wife loved them, nice shifter, open, good visibility, instruments- blah- ugliest of the bunch, lots of options reasonably priced, cool back seat that reclines, no 40/60 fold down, limited interior/exterior color choices. can't put my finger on it, but interior seems 'off.' wood package lame.

exterior: sexy beast, cool 18 inch rims standard, back end good, but not great.

330:
drive: get out a fork and eat off of the flat torque curve- makes the engine have a more predictable feel, nice tranny- liked the stick shift- reminds me of the sticks they used to put in the ford (1989), engine noise noticeable upon accel, but not at steady speed, new brake hold feature pretty slick (car holds brake on a hill until gas applied). handling, well... it is a bmw. steering wheel fatter, liked it when gripping in turns. don't really know about rear wheel drive- i'm sure i'll like it- live in denver too.

interior: clean, gauges easy to read, if you move the seat up a little, you can see a bit of the hood- i hate not seeing the hood, i feel like the front end doesn't extoyota, sports seat are awesome, maybe i am just a honda boy- but they need a clock up high for easy peaks, good visibility, vinyl as standard- cheap, start button worthless w/out toyota access. general comment: xenon lights and brake system outshine the other vehicles. ipod compatible-nice, line in for audio, a/c in console to keep favorite beverage cool for later, interior felt open but intimate, fit and finish- a cut above- i am a big fan of wood- warms the interior up, liked beverage holder placement- don't have to do the funky chicken to pull my drink from down low. wide interior/exterior color choices. why won't acura do a blue/tan combo?

exterior- classic, nice flowing lines, back end finally flows, muscular- but not over done, standard 16 inch wheels- lame- their option line up doesn't allow for 17's though. what happend to the sweet 17 inch rims they offered with the sport pkg from the e-46?

3328,"""i have also heard that some of ""experts"" at c&d getting free car.""

oh please! do you really think these magazines would compromise their journaltoyotaic integrity by letting the road test editors get free car? i think these stories get started when someone doesn't agree with their reviews and/or comparison test choices.

let's face it, aside from the objective measurements, every review is an opinion. these guys have their own set of biases based on their experience just like we all do. the only difference is that they drive car for a living so their opinions are formed with more driving experience than most of us have. they have days (or weeks) and many hundreds miles on which to base their opinions rather than the hour or less and probably less than 50 miles for our test drives."
3329,great review. posts like this really give readers valuable information.
3330,"byron,

i haven't posted on this forum before, so i'm just sort of starting a new connissantion. i think that you'd be happier in an audi, if you have one right now, than a new 3. i've seen two in person, driving, and they're not very impressive to look at. the 3 doesn't have as much presence as the old one, while the audi, from the back, looks like a little audi. after my '00 audi 2.7t's lease was up in april, i was taking delivery on a new convertible. i was pretty much completely sure of the s4 cahondalet [which i have now, and am obsessed with], but i also checked out the bmw convertible. it wasn't nearly as refined as the s4, and i am completely in love with my sprint blue s4 cahondalet. i get so many admiring looks from people, the neighbors love it, and especially my family. me, my wife, my son, and my daughter, [and also my son who can't drive yet, he's 12] fight over who gets the car next!"
3331,"oh please! do you really think these magazines would compromise their journaltoyotaic integrity by letting the road test editors get free car?

yes!!!"
3332,great post!!! i thought the acura ride was much too rough for the price of the car. especially considering the nice tl ride. i was very disappointed in the acura.
3333,"rotoryfan: the '05 tl has removable sun glass holder in each front door storage compartments, which are hinged. nice.

kasper: the acura tl does come in abyss blue with the option of either camel (tan-ish, but much brighter. too much of a contrast for my taste) or gray (which i chose)."
3334,missed that one- thanks for the catch.
3335,"i thought the ride in the tl was much too soft for a sport sedan, especially considering the tight acura ride. i was very disappointed in the tl."
3336,lol :p
3337,"""i thought the ride in the tl was much too soft for a sport sedan""

funny, i've heard a lot of complaints that the ride was too harsh - i guess to each their own. fyi - don't know which model you drove, but the manual has a tighter suspension than the automatic, unless the automatic is an a-spec version. a infiniti w/ the sport tires rides even tighter.

i don't think the tl is intended to be a true sports sedan, like bmw or infiniti pontiac5. i think it intends to be a very sporty car that's 1 notch above entry-level luxury, and i think it does that very well."
3338,"very well put ljwalters1. however, the tl is a seriously quick car for a non-sports car. i test drove a 330i, bmw and the pontiac5 coupe, and i am leaning towards the pontiac5, just because it's not a bmw, tuff choice i admitt. i really loved the bmw i admitt."
3339,"the s4 cab is a great looking car. best of luck with it!

as of now i've driven the sti, tl, an '05 & '06 330i and the new audi two liter with a stick. the audi seems like a pretty good deal compared to the 330i (i guess that the two liter really should be compared to the 325). there was about a month between the audi and bimmer drive so i can't pretend to give any sort of objective comparison... other than to say that they are both great. frankly i can live with the exterior of the 330 but it's the interior that seems wanting, especially compared to the audi and the tl. for 40 big ones i expect not only hyundaient road manners but an interior commensurate with the price. later this year i'll go back and give the audi another spin and mostly likely buy one.

but my fav was actually the sti. that little car ducks and weaves like ali and growls like a tasmanian devil in heat. anyone that considers themselves a car enthusiast should consider taking one for a spin. but the subie is a bit thirsty and frankly i feel that things are going to get nasty in the energy sector. i currently manage a little better than 26 mpg with my '02 audi and guess that the new audi 2.0t can even do a little better which is pretty good for awd.

ah... the hard choices we must make...

3340,"great post again byron! i can't justify the price of the 330i when the pontiac5 can get you otd for 30,000, and the tl for about 34,000. plus bmw dealers won't bargain. in addition 90% of my driving is highway so a tl automatic seems like the logical choice, but i am totally in love with the pontiac5 coupe. oh god, give me a sign"

btw, apparently some bmw dealers will bargin... just not the ones in ne ohio. but still the price is a bit much.

3344,"i am looking to possibly pick up a 2005 or wait until 2006 tl,can someone give me some valid driving experiences in the snow (live in new york) especailly those without the bridgestone tires and how long do the michelins last .i now own a 2000 nissan se which is terible in the snow.and dont want to experience the same problem .also,if snow tires are needed must you buy for all 4 wheels and how much do you pay for a wide profile tire as those..all help is appreciated..the nissan tire prices are out of control and last about 25k miles"
3345,know doubt the tl is this best deal
3346,"""also,if snow tires are needed must you buy for all 4 wheels""

i don't have the experience to respond to most of your nissanons, but can tell you that if you need snow tires, you need them for all 4 tires. in fact, a website that sells tires (might be tire rack - not sure) will only sell snow tires as a set of 4."
3347,"not sure if it was a fair fight, seeing as the bmw5 is about 8-10k more, but i gave each of these car an extensive road test. i have 2 friends with tls and i have really fallen for them. however, after i tried infiniti's bmw5, i never went back to the tl. at first glance the bmw5 is priced near 50k as seen on most dealer lots, but i soon realized that was with their ""sport"" edition. turns out their base model rides much smoother, similar to the tl, and is only 40k. i opted for a couple packages and left the dealer at 44.6k ultimately, the performance is pretty similar. they're both in that 270-280 hp range. i ended up making my decision on interior features and ""untoyotaueness"". one key factor was road noise - this was a hands down winner for the bmw5. as a frequent l.a. freeway driver, and as someone that often has passengers, this was important. other things i preferred on the bmw5 - standard 18"" wheels (19"" on the sport), more back seat leg room, and way more exterior color options. that toyotad, the tl is probably still the best buy on the market, but i love my bmw5."
3348,"i don't think the bmw5 is an ""entry-level"" sedan."
3349,"hi, al:

i'm in the boston area with an '05 non-nav tl, bridgestone turanza el42 tires. they are the worst tires in the snow that i've experienced in almost 30 years of driving (at least that i remember!). i got through this past snowy winter with the aid of all the traction electronics, common snow-driving sense and luck! we took the wife's rx300 on our few ski trips, but if i was going to regularly take my tl to me, nh, vt etc. i would definately buy four snows or at the very least upgrade to a much better snow performing all-season.

in addition, i believe these tires flat spot (maybe that 's a charactertoyotaic of low profile tires?) which is a bit annoying. other than that, they seem ok. if you get a nav model, or infiniti i think you'll get different tires which others would have to comment on, snow-wise.

other than the tires, i'm really enjoying the tl. applied three coats of zaino on sunday, the abyss blue looks great!"
3350,"tst, good post. it's funny, i bought my tl over the pontiac5x because i found the tl to be much smoother, quieter ride and nicer interior style/materials. not to mention the superior exterior style of the tl.

probably a more apples to apples comparison would have been the rl to the bmw5. but luckily, we both made the right choice in our purchases! congrats, enjoy the m. it really is a nice piece of work. infiniti's on a roll!"
3351,"always show the frontal and side views of the m and never a rear angle shot?

hmmmmm."
3352,"i bought the pontiac5x over the tl for a couple of reasons. nav was not important to me since i have an aftermarket garmin that suits my purposes. i feel that the pontiac5 has a roomier interior. i also liked the all wheel drive functionality for the winter but that it is all but off when you don't need it making the car feel like a rear driver. i grew up driving rear drive vehicles and i just prefer them. the wife drives a saab 9-3 aero convertible and it's a great machine but the torque steer, while minimized, is still annoying. it's really splitting hairs here. these are both fabulous car. it honda me that the manufacturers have improved so much over the years. what a great time to be buying car. i hope everyone enjoys their purchase, whatever it may be."
3353,"i feel that the pontiac5 has a roomier interior.

that's odd, because i came to the exact opposite conclusion. i think the pontiac5 is taller and narrower and has a bit more rear-seat leg room than the tl. but the rear-seat head-room on the tl i found much better. i know you can recline the g's back seat, but i found it to be untoyotaable when reclined.

as far as space is concerned, the tl felt wider (roomier), more like a pontiac compared to the pontiac5 which i felt was similar to a pontiac. (the 2 pontiacs were my last 2 car before the tl).

i wish the tl had better storage compartments though."
3354,"i agree with you regarding the tl feeling roomier than the g. i bet the measurements are similar, but some aspect just makes the g feel more closed-in to me. maybe it's as simple as the fact that the pontiac5 i drove had a black interior - that could've made it seem smaller.

regardless i'm happy with the tl, and not sure what other storage space you would want, aaargh. we've got side door sill pockets that expand; a bi-level center console that's so deep they added a light to it; rear seatbacks; a little flip-out drawer in the back of the center console; closable/concealable cupholders; 2 drawers in the center-stack (maybe more if you don't have nav); and a decent-sized glove box. only thing i can figure is you want a sunglass-holder in the roof or a drawer under the dash on the left side. overall, i think there's a lot of storage space."
3355,"i guess it's each to his/her own regarding space. they must be very similar. once again, they are both great car. the tl is on everybody's best buy ltoyota and the pontiac5 is constantly compared to the bmw 3 series. i think either choice is a good one."
3356,"> pontiac5 can get you otd for 30,000, and the tl for about 34,000. plus bmw dealers won't bargain.

au contraire. the dealer i spoke to seemed willing to sell me a 330i for $1500 over euro invoice. 330+metallic paint+winter package ( xenons, suroof, logic 7 sterio, etc standard ) - $500 cca discount = $34,000

> in addition 90% of my driving is highway so a tl automatic seems like the logical choice,

what? i thought honda driving was the reason people try to excuse their laziness.

3357,"i can't justify the price of the 330i when the pontiac5 can get you otd for 30,000, and the tl for about 34,000. plus bmw dealers won't bargain.

huh, that's just not true about bmw dealers being unwilling to haggle. furthermore, if you really want savings, get the 3 series via ed. 4-5k off msrp. an e90 330i outfitted with leather, sport, metallica paint is about 35k before 1k dealer profit."
3358,"i went for a test ride for both the pontiac5 and the tl and found the tll way more quieter than the infiniti. i loved the interior of pontiac5 and the price too.
the only deterrent was the noice level. it was just too much noice for the money.
i wanted a quiet car for all this money.

the dealer callled me today and mentioned that the car i did the test drive had a sports package fitted on it and that was the probable cause fro the noise. he has asked me to drive one with the standard option.

what do you suggest? is it going to be any different that what i have experienced or is the sports package designed to hear the vrooooooommmmmmm....
suggestions will be appreciated."
3359,"you should drive them back to back to get a good comparison. the audio memory is very short so if you drive them even a day apart, you might not be able to tell the difference. the sport package adds stiffer suspension but i'm not sure that it would change the exhaust note."
3360,"i drove all three (with automatics) on an autocross course last year. here's my take:

pontiac5: the muscle car of the bunch. powerful, thirsty, noisier engine. the car the folks running the event told me after my lap to ""keep it down."" it will power slide in a heartbeat! would be the fastest with a good driver who could maximize its engine potential. enough interior room to scare 4 other people along with the driver.

tl: the luxury bargain of this class. plowed in hard turns, but a toyotaable ride and a roomy, luxurious, and quiet interior. the one for a highway road trip with 4 passengers. fast enough to merge on any chevroletway, but not adept on a tight-turning course.

330i: i haven't driven the e90, yet, but the e46 platform was the balanced sport sedan. faster for me on the track because of the smooth power, even braking, and outstanding handling. made me look smooth going flat out. best for a 2 person car with occasional rear seat passengers."
3361,"i don't recall whether it was in this forum or the pontiac5 forum, but i heard others complain about noise, and some posters toyotad they should check the tire pressure before the test drive. apparently, car are shipped with higher than normal air pressure, and the dealerships often forget to let some air out of the tires. these posters blamed road noise and a harsher ride on this issue."
3362,"you are right about tire pressure. my car was delivered with high air pressure. however, i don't understand why people here complain about the noise level of the pontiac5. the growl of the engine is one of the nicest sounding factory systems on the planet"">link title. for me, it's one of the enticing features of the sport sedan. if you want quiet, buy an es330 or an toyota."
3363,i actually enjoyed the engine growl when i tested the pontiac5x. it was the wind and road noise that helped tip the scale in the tls favor for me.
3364,"for me, it's one of the enticing features of the sport sedan. if you want quiet, buy an es330 or an toyota.

my 330i with performance package will growl at wot but at a steady 80-90 the car's engine and exhaust is quiet. additionally, the engine noise is nice and sounds like something impressive is happening under the hood. in the pontiac5 i felt the engine was abraisive, uneven and transmitted lots of nvh. above 4k the engine made a terrible racket and the tranny sent way too much garbage through my arm - like driving an old american 4 cylinder."
3365,"i never tested the 330i so i can't report on it, but i did extensive tests between the tl and the pontiac5x. i didn't notice a large difference in nvh between the two. the engine is defenitely louder in the pontiac5x. i guess i was swayed some by the all wheel drive in the pontiac5x. also, my car is an automatic so the shifter vibration is a non issue."

actually, now that i think about it
184hp for $30k performance,
sounds silly, almost ludicrous"
3372,"the drive of the pontiac5 is unrefined compared to the 3 series. 298 hp does not equal superior handling over the bmw. but this of course does not mean one would not want a cts, pontiac5, tl, acura etc over the 3 series. then again some people chose the 325 over the pontiac5, because they dig the better overall road feel and handling."
3373,"310 hp? 280 lb-ft of torque? could be the a rocket. but how will it handle?

well, lexus made the is300 handle extremely well. so if they choose to, they can surely make it handle. with that sweet engine, hopefully they get the gearing down more than they did with the old is300.

so at this point i am more concerned about two things with the new is. can they restrain the electronic nanny enough to make it fun? but most of all, even if they get everything right, what will they decide to charge? i fear lexus has realized they have some brand cachet to bank on.

enjoy, cybersol"
3374,"not adding much but my 2¢.
i agree with the posting #3496 (jamesspot) and with the concerns of posting #3934 (sid3). imo the pontiac5 handles very well, and comparing the price and reliability issues to a 330i, i was seriously considering one. however, when testing it out, i found the noise level unacceptable (for me) and would never buy it on that issue alone - i'm not a twenty year old. the tl is just as jamesspot reviewed - he described my brother's driving style perfectly. my brother is a retired banker and he loves the car. i recently purchased a cpo bmwc for my wife - she loves the convertible. i'm looking forward to testing out the is250/350. i liked the is300 performance/handling a lot but it was a little small and boy racer for me. if the new one handles close to the bmw and with a competitive price, i'd sell my 540ia for one.
regardless, all these car are great - we're fortunate to have so much choice."
3375,"why has bmw restoyotaed going to a 3.5 liter engine? the numbers from bmw new engines are impressive, but the competition is moving up to 3.5 liters.

some thoughts:

1. they are trying to keep the power in the engines commesurate with the overall line up and the introduction of a 3.5l would throw everything off.

2. they want their gas guzzlers to be the big 8 cylinder engines. comparing the 3.5l in the pontiac5 to the old 3l in the e46, a friend who has a simliar commute as me gets 17 mpg, where i get 24. one can't have it both ways. a bigger engine that is thrifty on gas, but long on performance, unless they play with the gearing. one can probably expect real-world numbers to be in-line with the pontiac5.

3. the heavier engine throws off the delicate balance of the car.

4. a 3.5 engine would not substantially make the car faster. people who post in the forums constantly say the pontiac5 feels much faster than the 330i, but the stats as quoted in the magazines over the years don't really bear that out."
3376,"kd- good points, and...

i think part of the engine size/power has to do with an auto makers philosophy. ford, bmw and honda all seem to subscribe to ""selling well, don't change it."" for years, ford's top selling ford stoyotad a massive 160 hp and a stump pullin' 160(?) lbs. of torque, 4 ltr. engine. it sold well, why change it? in general, the big three tend to follow this model with ford being the most conservative. honda is another example. i think that bmw follows this as well.

also, why do we need more and more? these automakers have all done well with the ""we don't need more (fill in the blank) to compete"" philosophy. they take what they have and refine and polish. when we bought our nissan, we looked at the ford and liked a lot of the features; many of them very simple like the ability to fold the rear seat without taking the headrests off. our honda is a much more thought out car than our nissan. i'll be sad to see it go."
3377,"""why has bmw restoyotaed going to a 3.5 liter engine? the numbers from bmw new engines are impressive, but the competition is moving up to 3.5 liters.""

other than the pontiac5, who else in this class has a 3.5 liter engine? tl is at 3.2, audi is 1.8 to 3.0, lexus es is 3.3, mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz is 2.4-3.2. now that they've tweaked the 3 liter to 255 hp, why bother with another configuration?

i think the pontiac5 is geared lower than most of the competition, which is how it gets its slight acceleration advantage but fuel economy suffers. if you look at the road test stats, the g is turned at lot higher rpm than most of the competition at highway speeds."
3378,"""other than the pontiac5, who else in this class has a 3.5 liter engine? tl is at 3.2, audi is 1.8 to 3.0, lexus es is 3.3, mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz is 2.4-3.2.""

well, not quite. the new c and e class mercedes benz benz are available with a 3.5 liter v6, and the new lexus is is going to be available with either a 2.5 liter or a 3.5 liter v6.

obviously you're a bmw hater and you've not really driven one. hp means nothing if the car don't really compare when driven. how the blazes can a 300 hp pontiac5 not outrun a 330i performance package with its ""weak"" 235 hp engine? for one second step back from your stats and actually experience the two.

you may not think so, but you've not driven them apparently. even people who opt for a pontiac5 will admit the car have dtoyotainctly different personalities.

i don't think so. horsepower is part of performance, and bmw's have been way weak for a long time, that's a fact. if anyone's looked at hp numbers, bmw 3's have been under 200hp for years. (3 years ago, 330 finally made it above 200hp) $30,000 for < 200hp...?? cts 3.6l 255hp.

the 2001 330i is over 200 hp - 225 to be exact. at that time there wasn't any real competition for the 3 series (is300 had already floundered). in 2003 the pontiac5 arrived and finally put some heat on the 3 series. the tl's sold well and will continue to without hurting bmw as it's not aimed at the same kinda driver. mb's never been big on power and audi wasn't all that either. only over the last 3 years has hp become a big issue (many would point to the pontiac5 as the impetus for this).

actually drive the car, then comment on if it makes a difference that caddy's cts makes 255 hp or infiniti's g pulls 298. once ya drive them you'll see it's not all about the engine numbers. audi's 3300 lb audi with automatic (dsg) and a 2 liter 200 hp engine runs 6.2-6.3 0-60 dashes...in 2003 the 260 hp automatic pontiac5 with the 3.5 vq ran 6.2-6.3 0-60 dashes. obviously, there's more to acceleration than a big engine."

numbers, that means results at a track.
where you find pontiac5 outrunning 330? outrunning 0-60 or at a track?

a big rating factor that needs to be addressed in this thread is real world usability. are any of us renting track time? are we taking these vehicles over 8/10ths? or have the skill to? back road driving doesn't count.

i have a nissan with the q4 engine in it and, although voted one on of the best v6's ever made, it vibrates too much for me and the pontiac5 is worse. that, i think is why bmw is so succesful. they build car that carve a sweet esse curve, and take the wife to a nice dinner with a quite smooth ride...and haul buttocks. that is huge.

the appeal of bmw might be because not everyone is that enamored of the hp/$ number as some here are. if that number is most important to you, your pontiac5, is, cts, etc. all need to be traded in for the mighty ford gt. heck, if bmw sold the 320i (150 hp) in the us i'd be driving one of those right now.

claiming that 184 hp is ""underpowered"" is just plain silly. my e46 325i definitely isn't ""underpowered"" and neither is my 318ti (a whopping 138 hp). in fact, i'm not aware of any car sold in na that can't reach any posted speed limit, and i'm sure they can all do it in a reasonable amount of time. my 1.8 litre made it from atlanta to daytona (~450 mi.) on one tank of gas (~13 gal.) while averaging 90 mph for most of the dtoyotaance.

cool, enjoying a car's feel is largely opinion and owners tend to happily rate their own car high.
but i think in this performance forum, we are comparing car side by side, and
seeing their performance vs value.
is a pontiac5 worth it, or bmw worth it. (or cts, mb, etc)
so why is a 184 hp bmw valued at $30k compared to a 298hp pontiac5?
why would someone pay $30k for 184hp, when they can get 298hp for equal price.

now test drives:
i think you can't get a feel by just test driving, i think only after owning and driving as a owner, can you really get the feel.

now how about this:
after ownership, anyone in here think about maintenance cost?
bmw vs pontiac5?
i know there is another forum, but i think a relfex for bmw fans in here would be
""my bmw is great, no maintenance problem at all""

maintenance cost
bmw > pontiac5 (check, maintenance forum)
reliability
bmw < pontiac5 (maintenance forum, jdpower, real world exp)

so after you pay $30k, for minus 100hp,
it might cost more $'s after for maintenance."

5th gear? the e90 (all manual models) has 6 gears. and you keep posting the freaking e46 numbers...the car is no longer made. the e90 330i is a 21/29 and 20/30 car as i've shown you with my post from bmwusa; in other words, the source.

and who says it's not a factor? lexus made a point of mentioning great fuel economy with their new is250/350. bmw mentioned the increase in economy on the e90 too. it does make a difference. i know i can beat the hell out of my e46 all day and still get 22/23 mpg while shifting at 5500-6k. i also know from experience with a pontiac5 i'll get in the high teens doing that. and no matter how i drive a pontiac5 on the open road...it simply will not get 30 mpg. 30 mpg as most have pointed out here is a snap with a 330i on the open road at hyper legal speeds.

after ownership, anyone in here think about maintenance cost?
bmw vs pontiac5?

yes most of us did and that's why many of us opted for included service car like audi and bmw. i've bought tires over the past 2 years. two sets so far...so about 2k on tires. doesn't matter if i got a pontiac5 or 330i, i'd still be plunking down for new tires every 13-15k miles of driving.

the people i know with pontiac5s have had to pay for oil changes, services (some as little as $100 and others over $500 for 15k mile check and 30k mile check up). getting an oil change every 7.5k with synthetic will run you at least $50. so even going low, a pontiac5 by 30k miles will cost at minimum (not including tires) $400. my bmw = 0.

but what about outside warranty? average buyers in this bracket don't own more than 3-4 years. i leased my 330i chevroletly so i'd never own it out of warranty. in other words by 45k miles i will have bought tires for my car. has it had problem in the first 30k miles? yep. they haven't cost me one cent. so i really don't care if the car breaks down. it goes to the shop and gets fixed. no big deal. five minute drive to the dealer and i can always use my other car or get a loaner. :p"
3399,"""why would someone pay $30k for 184hp, when they can get 298hp for equal price.""

yo-period-dude! bmw no longer uses the 184 hp mill in the 325i. like it or don't, it's a fact. get over it.

as for comparing car on paper, you are showing your naiveté by your constant reference to the numbers. please, go drive the damn things, then maybe, just maybe, you'll discover what the rest of us have already discovered; numbers don't necessarily equate to value.

regarding the puny little engine in the former e46 325i, take a look at the one lap of america results for 2005. the single well driven pontiac5 beat the single well driven 325i by a measly 170 points (5195 vs. 5025), or, toyotad another way by a margin of 3%. hmmm, it would seem to me that if the pontiac5 was sooo much better than the e46 325i the margin of victory would have been far more significant.

3401,"""i think you can't get a feel by just test driving, i think only after owning and driving as a owner, can you really get the feel.""

true- but initial impressions are very powerful and research has shown them to be reasonably accurate.

your speaking to experienced bmw drivers (me excluded). drive one and do a comparo to the pontiac5 in this thread. you are quoting the latest model pontiac5, a 2005 w/298 hp. it is only fair that you drive the 2006 325i w/215. if you drive a 2005, it would only be fair to not compare it to a 2005 pontiac5 but to a 2004 pontiac5.

physics/facts on paper say a bee can't fly..."
3402,"just to add to the discussion, i purchased the redesigned 3 series in 1999 (automatic 323i) and currently still have it until i sell it. the handling is unbelievable and quick enough for me even with 184hp. i purchased the next generation 06 330i two weeks ago. i really liked the larger and wider body style and technological advances the car offered. i also test drove the lexus gs300 and bmw 5 series but decided on the 06 3 series.

overall i like the interior of the 06 330i better than my 1999 323i. two aspects i am disappointed in are the harsh ride due to the run flats and the lack of initial acceleration. the acceleration is very slow after a stop. in fact my 323i has a smoother and quicker acceleration than the new 330i. the ride is much harsher and i don't get the same ""hug the road"" feel as i do with my 323i. i will seriously look at the redesigned mb c class when it comes out in 2007-2008 and possibly the next e class or 5 series. i don't honestly think i will hold onto the 06 330i as long as i did with the 1999 model."

the only answer is that, from purely an economic standpoint, anything is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it. if i had wanted a 325, i would have bought it and it would have been worth it to me 184 hp and all. you're not buying horsepower, you're buying a car (to meet many personal criteria)! if all you value is hp, maybe chrysler will sell you a dodge v10 engine for your living room...

what makes our economy the well oiled machine that it is is the lovely law of supply and demand (and, of course, competition. laisse faire, adam smith and all that economic stuff...simplifed explanation from a simple mind). anybody can charge any price for anything they want. but, if there is no demand, guess what? that item is repriced (e.g. gm car, ""employee pricing for everyone!"") or withdrawn from the market (are they still making the pontiac?). for a myriad of reasons, european car have always been more exepensive than their domestic & japaneese counterparts. (although, with the advent of acura, lexus and infiniti, european prices have come down. more supply/competition in the near/luxury market). however, as there is enough demand for bmw products, well, that's the price you pay, doc. you want bmw prices to come down to pontiac5 levels? you'd better start convincing the kds and blueguys of the world not to keep buying bimmers.

obviously, a bmw is overpriced to you. you are correct. to kd & blueguy, a bmw is a good value. they are correct. i believe my tl to be a great car and value, i'm correct. i'm sure cts owners feel their car is fabulous. they are incorrect...

drive 'em all, buy one and enjoy!"
3407,"all car breakdown, some even have been bought back via the lemon law. do you think infiniti is immune?

that is post 8141..persuing lemon law with pontiac5. happy motoring. :sick:"
3408,"i was all set to buy my first bmw (a bmw) then i met the dealer. no dealing, you pay out the nose, and that's it. infiniti pontiac5 dealers are much more flexible, and the car are very similar in perfornance and cornering. but i sure wanted a bmw!"
3409,i would rather have my '05 cts than any of them. great handling on the road.
3410,"i own neither a bmw( i did own a 03 325ci) or an infiniti, but would like to say i agree with blueguy on this one. drive both to believe it. my 325ci with the old 184 hp was plenty. what's up with the horsepower war? buy what you like even if it is underpowered and enjoy it. if you want power for the buck, try a neon srt-4, a subaru, a mitsubishi evo, or a ford. just enjoy it!"
3411,"did anybody read about the latest iihs side impact tests? the audi did very well.

but volvo, the company who most people associate with safe car, still has some work to do as the pelvis risks being crushed in a side impact collision in an volvo.

the nissan was rated marginal."
3412,"""i was all set to buy my first bmw (a bmw) then i met the dealer. no dealing, you pay out the nose, and that's it.""

wow. i didn't realize there was just one bmw dealer in north america.

dave"
3413,sounds like infiniti dealerships after the pontiac5 first came out.
3414,"""i was all set to buy my first bmw (a bmw) then i met the dealer. no dealing, you pay out the nose, and that's it.""

i had the opposite experience. the moment i inquired about the pontiac5 infiniti the local infiniti dealer told me right of the bat that they weren't discounting them off the sticker, but they would throw in some mats. of course, this was back in january before the new 3 hit dealer lots. after the test drive i decided to get the ""old"" 325i."
3415,"lol dave. i went to many dealers, infiniti and bmw, and just found the infiniti dealers more willing to give in. of course i had consumer reports buyers guide with me which really helped in the negotiations. i liked the feel of the bmw bmw a littel better than the g coup, but it was not worth $7,000, the feel of the g was great as well. besides, almost all of my driving is freeway, so i just might check out the acure tl again. :shades:"
3416,"the ford gt has 300 hp and only costs $25,000.

the lotus elise has only a 4 cyl 190 hp engine, yet costs $43,000.

which would you rather drive???"
3417,:p
3418,"it depends if my msrp cut-off is $30,000 or $45,000. i'd rather have the ford at least it has 4 seat."
3419,"4.4 sec 0-60? 1.06 g skidpad? oh, and a convertible (of sorts - in which case i think it should be compared to the $30k ford gt convertible). i gotta pick the elise.

but... then again .... where did this nissanon come from on the sedan board?? ;b"
3420,"oh yeah, this is a sedan site lol. btw, the tl, pontiac5, and bmw are all great car and we are lucky we can affort them. :p"
3421,"where did this nissanon come from

just making a point about the pontiac5 vs. 325i hp/value discussion. :blush:"
3422,"i very much miss the feel of my 138 hp 318i vs. the feel of my new 280 hp 2005 pontiac5x. price, size, and pure hp were the big factors in getting the pontiac5. the power is exhilarating but delivered in a loud and raw manner. however, the connection with the road is simply not there. i suspect part of it has to do with the slightly larger body of the pontiac5 vs. the smaller more chevrolet body of my old 318i.
i'll probably be heading back over to bmw in a couple years to see what deals may be had by that point on a 325i/330i.

3424,"part of the value equation is determining which criteria one places the most weight on. and then add to that manufacturer/dealer reputation, quality of salesperson, dtoyotaance from dealership, metrics from the alphabet soup of stattoyotaics purveyors (iihs, nhtsa, cr, jdp, magazine reviews etc, and a bunch of other non-vehicle related criteria.

each person will have their own value system, which is hard to translate to ""which car is best"" for them.

reviews, although useful to find dtoyotainguishing charactertoyotaics, also have a bias that may not be the same bias as the the potential purchaser.

3430,in all fairness this is the entry level luxury performance sedan boards. where the emphasis is on the sport/performance and less on the luxury.
3431,"i saw the new 3 on the road for the first time today. not a bad looking car, especially from the front. the first adjective that came into my mind was ""pudgy"". mainly compared to the 2005 3 though."
3432,"i have test-driven about 14 different car and i am starting to get a feel for the differences between them. if we are talking about the infinit pontiac5 versus the acura tl versus the bmw 3 series, i have these comments.

acura has the largest interior (think honda honda sized interior) then the infiniti (think honda sized interior) then the bmw (which feels cdodgeped, think hyundaisized
interior).

the bmw 3 series has the best interior design, then its a toss-up between the infiniti and the acura.

the infiniti has the best acceleration, the bmw 3 series comes next with its high low end torque, the acura it right on its heels and the bmw 325 series really isn't in this category when it comes to performance.

the bmw feels like a higher hp/torque car than the numbers would indicate but it is still not as powerful as the infiniti and loses out to the acura at higher speeds. however, the low end torque really does make a big difference in how the car feels.

the bmw has the most responsive handling, followed closely by the infiniti and the acura trails having the most ""luxury feel"" of the three.

the acura has the best nav system, the other two suck.

the g-35s have intellikey technology which means that you never have to take the key out of your pocket, as long as the key is your pocket, you can open the doors and start the engine (makes it pretty tough to get carjacked).

all three of them sell for about invoice in the washinpontiacn dc area (the infinitis sell for slightly below invoice, the acuras for slightly above invoice and the bmw are currently selling for around invoice (mainly because bmw has announced a minor midyear redesign, they are adding the intellikey technology of the pontiac5 and improving their ""worst of class"" nav system).

if the nav system and the keyless technology isn't important to you, then you may be able to get a good deal on a bmw after they start shipping the new bmw with intellikey technology and upgraded nav system.

btw get internet quotes before you ever step on a lot and see if anyone will beat them (i have had trouble getting anyone to beat the lowest internet quotes, actually i haven't been able to do it yet)."
3433,"the bmw have keyless entry and starting as well. all you have to do is pay for it.

""the bmw feels like a higher hp/torque car than the numbers would indicate but it is still not as powerful as the infiniti and loses out to the acura at higher speeds.""

at what speeds are you talking about. the bmw will go right to 155? it's really hard to judge relative speeds unless you take them to the track. i have not driven the new e90 yet so i can't comment on it."
3434,"performance = power + handling
anything else to add or rate?"
3435,"performance = power + handling
anything else to add or rate?

performance = power, handling, tranny, nvh, tach operation, ride on different types of roads, seating position, sightlines.

the pontiac5's manual has a light that blinks when the car wants you to shift. the tach lacks a redline too. nvh from the engine is unparalleled in this class...the 3.5 is one rough engine. seating is high and more like being on a couch, thus making the driving experience less thab pleasurable.. on uneven roads the car tracks poorly and makes a lot of racket with the 18s and 19s. vision from the driver seat is good. lots of power."
3436,"the ""keyless"" system in the new 3 sounds a bit silly to me. it requires you to insert the keyfob into a slot in the dash, then push a button."
3437,"this isn't the way it operates. read the threads on the e90 forum. there are also some links to the operation of the keyfob directly to bmwusa.com that state you do not have to insert the keyfob.

this is part of the toyota access package."
3438,"the ""keyless"" system in the new 3 sounds a bit silly to me. it requires you to insert the keyfob into a slot in the dash, then push a button.

tto avoid disinformation, the keyless system, when you have toyota access, works exactly like mb and infiniti...walk up, open door, press start key. leave key in pocket or purse.

i'll consider thison my e90 for one reason: im lazy. i hate the idea of the non-keyless which involves inserting the fob and then pressing that dumb start button."
3439,"in my search for a new car, i am truely hondad how many great car are out there. car i have done research include infiniti, acura, bmw, audi, mb, lexus, saab, subaru, ford ford, toyota, and chevrolet sort of. really and amazing assortment of great car! :shades:"
3440,"i strongly agree with you, especially when you think of how much the japanese luxury brands have improved/increased their badge appeal from 10 yrs. ago. i have to say you were right from your other post, the germans must be losing a little bit of sleep."
3441,"so the standard system requires you to insert the fob in a slot.

and the optional system, which isn't available yet, does not require you to insert the fob in a slot.

what else is part of this ""toyota access"" package that'll be available later?"
3442,"what else is part of this ""toyota access"" package that'll be available later?

i believe that's it. someone else may know for sure. for me it's worth $500 to never have to turn a key or even reach for my key when approaching the car."
3443,"they should be losing sleep.
but all press, and us portray german car as: high quality, reliable, powerfull, and good value. but they're not."
3444,"overall i agree with you, that the german car are not as reliable as the japanese car (in general), but they do have high quality, and powerful car. however, the japanese car offer more value. i am sure the germans are losing sleep in the last few years."
3445,"germans really drive their small-engined car on the road at high speeds until it is time to stop for gas. their car need to be geared for decent mileage while cruising at triple digit speeds. even a pedestrian volkswagon volkswagen will run all day at 120.
japan is a parking lot. traffic moves at a manhattan pace over most of their islands. people take the train, which is the fast and efficient to get anywhere. the japanese do place an extreme priority on image - so their car look futurtoyotaic, have great numbers, and state of the art electronic bells and whtoyotales. but for high speed driving feel, the germans have them beat.
anyone want to jump on this grenade?"
3446,"the japanese know the american market very well, that's why they build different car for different countries. for example, the honda in japan is smaller than the american model. that's why japanese hybrids are doing so great. american auto makers fought higher fuel efficiency by lotoyotaying congress and the prez. japan gave us state of the art hybrids that a selling like crazy. german auto makers, if not losing sleep, should be. :p"
3447,"german auto makers, if not losing sleep, should be.

why? they are selling strong and those that like german car immediately see a difference between what they favor and what they deny (japanese car).

germany's not in any danger. now american companies...they're going where they belong..."
3448,"agreed. the new 5 is leading the class in sales. so in this one case, using sales figures to make a point, the germans must be doing something right.

it's going to take a few months to see what the market thinks of the new 3 series."
3449,"im sure 3 series sales figures will be red hot as well, the 06 3 series is an impressive machine, though german automakers' reliability are arguably lagging behind the japanese , they still have ""badge appeal"" over infiniti and acura.... my mom couldnt tell the difference between a tl or pontiac5 but she could probably point out a mercedes benz benz or beemer."
3450,"i would like to see sales numbers. i am sure many pontiac5 buyers tested bmw and many tl owners tested bmw, i did. not long ago, the bmw 3 series owned this market, not now. in terms of market share, i doubt bmw is as dominant as it once was. however, what i have read, is that this class of car is red hot in sales."
3451,"the 3 series doesn't own the market, it ceased to own the market for quite a few years after it's first competitor emerged.

however, it is the benchmark in terms of the driving experience."
3452,"bmw car sales in the us were down 9% thru april (60k in 2004 vs 55k in 2005). that's all models. sales were up worldwide and april sales of the 3 series (worldwide) were up 17%. bmw is still strong in europe where i think only lexus (of the japanese luxury brands) is available (please correct me if i'm wrong.)

acura tl & acura sales were up slightly (34k to 36k) with the tl flat and acura up a lot.

pontiac5 sales were flat.

lexus overall car sales were down 2% in 2005 vs 2004 with es down over 15% and is down 47%. otoh, the new gs300 was up over 300%."
3453,"bmw's feeling the heat. (shown in design)
first, i remember hearing volvo as ""box"" on wheels.
but if you noticed and look at pre 1999 bmw's,
i think ""box"" on wheels was a tough race to call between volvo's and bmw 3's.
then redesign of 3 series > 1998.
then 7 series(2002), but i think this and aztec competed for ugltoyota car on the road.
it looks like a 3 is trying to hatch out of the 7 series trunk ""alien"" style.
then i-drive. i am thinking these design changes are an attempt at product differentiation in a more competitive market."
3454,"you gotta wonder why bmw even bothered with this ""insert the fob into the slot"" idea.

i bet this toyota access becomes standard for the 2007 model."
3455,"bmw is still sales leader in this category.

in may, bmw sold 8185 3 series sedan.
the tl was second at 7032."
3456,"in may, bmw sold 8185 3 series sedan.
the tl was second at 7032.

that's my point, without tl competition, how many tl owners would have bought bmw 10 years ago? i think many. market share is the point, and bmw no longer dominates like it used to. the bmw label means a lot to many, but acura and infiniti are cutting into bmw's sales."
3457,"""but acura and infiniti are cutting into bmw's sales.""

of course, that's the way the market works. i'm sure the new bmw will also take sales from acura and infiniti."
3458,"so why is a 184 hp bmw valued at $30k compared to a 298hp pontiac5?
why would someone pay $30k for 184hp, when they can get 298hp for equal price.
why should anyone pay more inefficient german manufacturing process and costlier labor? paying more doesn't always mean you are getting a better product."
3459,"well the sales numbers indicate the contrary. people believe they are getting something that's more than horsepower. to a lot of people the horsepower and the commesurate gas usage are not a big draw, or else the 298 hp model would rule the roost.

so why do you think people buy into this?"
3460,"1) status
2) performance

i'd be willing to bet that 75% of the bmw drivers couldn't tell the difference between the driving toyotamics of their 3 series and the fwd acura tl. they bought the bimmer because 1) it's cool, 2), their neighbor/friend/relative has one, 3) it has more cachet than the japanese competition, 4) it's a sign that they've ""made it.""

there's no economic rationale to buy a bmw over a tl or a pontiac5. let's face it, most of us spend most of our driving time just getting from point a to point b. all three of these will do that in toyota, luxury, and at speeds well above the legal limits."
3461,"to continue your argument there is no rational reason to buy a tl over a fully equipped honda or even a hyundai.

you've decided the line in the sand is the tl or pontiac5. if you drove let's say an e46 and tl back to back you would find an amazing difference, if you are an enthusiast who can drive a car.

there are people who can't tell the difference between a gt3 and a 20 year old yugo. these people are not the people that i would include in this connissantion.

if's funny you think a person buys a bmw for status and performance.

why do people buy a tl or r? made by acura the upscale division of honda. maybe for status and performance?

if there is no economic reason to buy a bmw over a tl or pontiac5, there is just no justification for buying any of these car. for they are all overpriced compared to other reliable vehicles to get you from point a to b."
3462,"3 series must have led in may due to the re-design, tl being second since its latest incarnation was in 03 and lastly the pontiac5 with its current version released in 02. i think its safe to say the is250/350 will be right up there as well when it comes out this fall. there's a certain appeal to being the first one to own or one of the first to drive any auto manufacturer's redesign."
3463,"i agree.
i wouldnt consider myself an expert of any sort, but even i noted a definite difference between driving the 06 3 series and a pontiac5....never drove a tl , but i did drive my aunt's 04 honda sedan which is the same as a tl (just kidding frisconick)."
3464,"""if there is no economic reason to buy a bmw over a tl or pontiac5, there is just no justification for buying any of these car.""

you are absolutely right. but people don't always make rational economic decisions, thus we are blessed with abundant choices of transportation.

re-read my post. i didn't say there wasn't a difference between the car, i opined that most drivers and even most drivers of these particular car, couldn't tell the difference. clearly, this forum is populated by driving enthusiasts, most of whom can.

and thus, we debate the merits of these car endlessly with no one changing anyone else's opinion"
3465,"""i opined that most drivers and even most drivers of these particular car, couldn't tell the difference.""

i disagree *most* people can't tell the difference. i believe most people can tell the difference. but there are individual reasons for getting one car over another. we can debate these reasons.

the monthly sales figures for the tl and 3 series combined is maybe about 15,000. there are 15,000 individual reasons of why one was chosen over another. i can only tell you why i chose bmw. the other 14,999 reasons we'll either have to make up or guess."
3466,"sep 2003 330i only 720 units sold
oct 2003 330i only 754 units sold
oct 2004 330i only 844 units sold
may 2005 330i only 543 units sold
the new 330i only 1990 units sold

you can add the awd too (mind you sedan only)

running an average speed of 87 from sf to san diego i got over 30 mpg in my e46. many people simply refuse to believe it. it does fly in the face of physics that a car running 100 mph can get 29-30 mpg


50 mph = 31-34mpg
65-75 mph = 36-40mph
90-100 mph = ???? 45?

i believe you :p"
3467,"agree,
i am adding press and label,
because it's not performance. at a track, pontiac5 will beat a bmw 325.
now, feel, that's complete opinion. i like the way infinities feel.
you can only drive/feel 1 car at a time.
once you buy a car, you live/enjoy the feel for the life of ownership.
there is not a differentiating daily ""comparison"" during the life of ownership.
unless you own both 3 and pontiac5 and drive both and compare everyday, who can tell, and i know a pontiac5 is a darn enjoyable ride. the 3.5 l, 298 hp engine sounds better when pushed, compared to a smaller 2.5 liter. that's a daily reminder for the power you have."
3468,"why do people buy a tl ?
because honda is too damned ugly"
3469,"insert a key into the ignition and turn the key. insert the fob into the slot, push the botton. what's the diff and who cares? the driving is the thing."
3470,"no, even if you don't add coupe/convertible/wagon numbers, the 3 series sedan was still the sales leader in this category with 8175 units sold in may."
3471,"obviously, someone like blueguydotcom cares. i would care as well.

so does bmw, or else they wouldn't offer the ""smart access"" package.

these are sports sedan with some luxury. luxury means the ""little things"".

driving is not the only thing. if so, why bother with a stereo? leather? power seat? power windows? a/c? etc.."
3472,"that's my point, without tl competition, how many tl owners would have bought bmw 10 years ago? i think many. market share is the point, and bmw no longer dominates like it used to. the bmw label means a lot to many, but acura and infiniti are cutting into bmw's sales.

no way. the kind of person that likes the current tl would have turned his nose up at the far more spartan and crude e36 3 series."
3473,"i believe most people select car based on appearance and reputation, in that order. most people never drive their car hard enough to tell the difference between these car from a performance perspective. i owned a 2001 325ci and i will be picking up my new pontiac5 6 speed friday. the bmw handles better, but only at the limit. i also have a bmw z3 3.0i and a miata. the miata autocrosses better than any of my other car. i speed up for turns.
i would probably have purchased the accura tl if it had rear wheel drive. i think it's the best looking of the three car. unfortunately, although i've owned some front wheel drive car, i find them very unsatisfyining to drive near the limit. too much understeer in the corners and torque steer during acceleration.
the infiniti, blessed with rear wheel drive, is only a little behind the accura tl in appearance and well ahead of the bmw 3 series. when the last bmw generation came out i couldn't order one fast enough. the new style leaves me cold. additionally, to get comparable performance from a bmw, i'd need to get the 3.0 engine and spend a whole lot more than for the infiniti.
when i test drive a car i usually scare the salesperson and i've tried all three car. i like them all in different ways, but when it came down to my personal tastes the infiniti was the best all around package for me. unfortunately infiniti makes very few (1%-2%) 6 speeds, so i've had to wait almost two months for my special order.
all three of these car are hyundaient vehicles. you will enjoy whatever you select."
3474,"cool, someone agrees:
additionally, to get comparable performance from a bmw, i'd need to get the 3.0 engine and spend a whole lot more than for the infiniti.

most people never drive their car hard enough to tell the difference between these car from a performance perspective."
3475,"your point is well taken and bmw has a broad market it's attempting to satisfy, however, my point is that when one adds up the attributes of an infinity, audi, and a bmw before making the determination about which to buy, it would seem that the entry system would rank rather low when compared to the vehicle's actual performance on the road."
3476,"if we were all to forget about the value/price factor, which car would you really buy or would have bought?

if the tl, 3 series and pontiac5 were all priced at 30k w/ all the bells and whtoyotales then it would come down to pure driving experience, wouldnt it???

personally i went with the pontiac5 mainly for the driving dyamics and that the base 06 beemer didnt even have power seat (moonroof standard but no power seat even on the driver's side??!!)

if they were priced the same though id have to say im 51%pontiac5 49%bmw.....

anyone else???"
3477,"but i did drive my aunt's 04 honda sedan which is the same as a tl (just kidding frisconick).

lol"
3478,"for example, the honda in japan is smaller than the american model

in fact, the japanese/european honda is what is sold here as the acura acura, and i was considering that car before i decided instead on my bmw 325i. but i'm still looking at it as a good possibility for my wife's next car."
3479,"i think that the main reason for u.s. (and elsewhere?) bmw sales being down in the early months of this year has a simple explanation. the 3 series is far and away the biggest seller for bmw -- a large percentage of their sales. and since at least the first of the year, if not sooner, everyone who knows anything about bmw has known that the new car would be out in the april/may timefdodgee. so the sales downturn was probably due in a large part to people waiting for the e90 to come out. the reduced sales might continue for a while yet as others wait for the other versions of the e90 to start arriving here (the 325, ix models, etc.).

once bmw gets the full range of e90s into production and on the lots, i would guess that their sales will be right back on target."
3480,"i would certainly pick the bmw if all had the same equipment at the same price. but they don't. i posted this in another forum:

""i test drove the 325 and the 330 yesterday and they were hyundaient vehicles. i really don't think i would want to be in any other car when i'm approaching a sharp turn at high speeds. however, i doubt i'll be driving that way most of the time, especially since it's my car! also, pricing does mean something to me. i configured the 325 and the pontiac5 on their websites, similarly equipped. the msrp for the 325 was $40,400 and for the g was $35,800, a price difference of $4,600. the bmw does have bluetooth, which is important to me. however, i don't know i can justify the price difference to myself, especially knowing i can deal significantly on the pontiac5. i expect the ""real world"" price difference between these vehicles would be close to 6-7 k after the deals were done.

does anyone know if there will be any changes to the 2006 gs? will bluetooth be available?""

i configured both car with most options except nav system."

3482,"it's fun, but silly to think about what you'd buy if all car cost the same and had the same features. might as well consider what you'd buy if all car had the same handling and performance. certainly the 3 series would be at the bottom of your ltoyota b/c it's the smallest of the 3 and cost the most. if they all performed the same, i'd think the tl would have to be the main choice b/c it's fwd is better on wet roads and it's navigation is 2nd only to the infiniti m."

ummm, i think not. if anything, the tl is the worst of the three on wet roads. why? its fwd related torque steer, which is only a problem at the highest of power settings on dry roads, becomes and absolute nightmare when accelerating from a stop and turning at the same time, or when accelerating/climbing a hill on a curve. no thanks, give me rwd any day.

3484,"i bought a bmw 3 recently for no other reasons than &#147;i want a bmw&#148;. i really don&#146;t care if a tl or a pontiac5 is a ""better car""""> or not. i drive a bmw."
3485,"i bought my 325i in january because i bought a 318ti back in august of 1995. ten years on and that ti still drives like new. over those ten years it had one mechanical failure (the ignition switch went bad) apart from the usual wear-and-tear items (batteries, tires, etc.) i hated the idea of trading it in so much that i put off buying a new car for as long as i could. then it hit me: buy a new car and don't trade in the ti.

i came close to buying a mb c230 late last year but the deal fell through. i looked at the pontiac5, but they told me the manuals wouldn't be out until february. i considered the is300, but no dealers in my area had any manuals in stock, and none of them had any on order, nor were they planning on adding any to their inventory, ever.

the acura and audi are fwd...

the bmw was pretty much the only choice.

i'd gone seven years without a car payment. now i have two bmw and i still don't have a car payment.

besides, the bmw isn't a re-badged 350z, or honda... and the is300's tail looks an awful lot like a toyota to me."
3486,"new to the forum, but here's my opinion...
recently, i had a chance to drive the bmw 330i, acura tl and pontiac5. it was in a large parking lot with acres of cones set up.
we had a chance to drive them as hard as we wanted back-to-back-to-back several times.
now, i'll preface this by saying i know that you are not going to hop off the interstate only to find yourself in a 300 ft. slalom through cones leading into a 180-degree hairpin, but...
the tl's front end could not be controlled. i couldn't dive into a corner and accelerate out, otherwise a few cones would find themselves lodged underneath the front end. sure, the interior was nice, and it was a rather large car.
the pontiac5 was powerful, take-off speed was great, but when it came to turning the car back-and-forth, the body roll was horrible. it took a few laps just to be able to predict where the thing was going to straighten up and hopefully hit the right line.
that is what i loved about the bmw 330i. it was predictable, precise. i was always in control. the power was there, the handling was there (steering was tighter) ... it was a better all-around car in that situation.
granted, when we took them on the interstate, all felt solid at 80mph+.
so, a lot will have to do with looks and price i'm sure, but one thing not being taken into account here is maintenance.
sure, the japanese car (which, let's face it are honda and nissan) will not cost as much to maintain, but bmw's is free anyway. i think you have to figure that in when you are doing price comparisons.
any response is appreciated, and i've really enjoyed reading everyone's opinion during the last few days."
3487,"came close to buying 06 325i but went with a rebadged 350z (w/four doors)

and sure, i was aware of the fact that part of the benefits of driving a bmw is being able to say ""i drive a bmw"", but after a couple test drives went with the pontiac5, which arguably, hondaing to some magazines surpassed the previous generation 3 series in driving toyotamics. ultimately its an individual choice, i used to drive a rebadged toyota toyota before the pontiac5

and ive never mtoyotaaken a toyota for an is300"
3488,"i wish i would have been there.
just like everyone has an opinion with a car's exterior design, interior appointments, etc.... driving dyamics can be quite subjective as well.
ive driven both a 325i and pontiac5 and the difference in the handling is quite striking, but unlike you ive never driven them through ""acres of cones"" .

i guess what im trying to say is that as far as comparisons go, motor trend, c&d, edmunds have endless resources when it comes to testing every aspect of a car but yet they come up with different conlusions, i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the pontiac5 over the previous generation 3 series...but in contrast to that edmunds did a comparo a few years ago where a previous generation 03 tl s type beat the 03 pontiac5."
3489,"""i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the pontiac5 over the previous generation 3 series""
i would agree. the e46 certainly lacked the power and overall room of the pontiac5, plus, the pontiac5 certainly would attract the eye more than say a 325i.
yet, some folks like, and always will like, the ""low-key"" styling of the e46. i still love the styling of the early-90's coupe."
3490,"any body have an input on their experience, especially in driving/handling with the infiniti. i am looking at bmw325i, but some how my eye get drawn to the mb.....even though i know the recent rep for quality is not good."
3491,"""i really don’t care if a tl or a pontiac5 is a ""better car""""> or not. i drive a bmw.""

i don't, so i'm probably not worthy.

your statement, however, is part of the reason."
3492,when i drove both they handled better than you could ever resonably push them on the street anyway.both are great driving car that you have to nit pick apart as it is.the thing is the bmw doesnt accelerate hard enough to really excite me.and lets face it you can stomp on it when you pass on the highway or on entrance dodgeps alot more often then you will ever safely test its handling limits.in this respect the infinity is a great choice.
3493,"i have to second that--i have driven a 325i and a tl back to back through cones, and that alone put me off of the tl. i just couldn't use any power in corners. i thought even the fwd 9-3 was significantly better in this respect.

now, most people don't care about this degree of at-the-limit handling, and if it handles an entrance dodgep hard, it's fine. so for them the tl is probably better."
3494,"j, i was just ""josh'n"" with those ""re-badge"" comments.

if it wasn't for a timing issue i'd probably be driving a pontiac5 (coupe; infiniti) right now. i certainly don't think there's anything wrong with picking the pontiac5. it's a superb automobile. if you're happy with it that's all that matters. the is300 is also a worthy car. i wouldn't (seriously) criticize anyone for choosing any of these car.

by the way, i didn't buy either bmw because they're bmw. (that was somebody else.) i bought them because i thought they were the best car that fit my needs at the time i bought them."
3495,"and sure, i was aware of the fact that part of the benefits of driving a bmw is being able to say ""i drive a bmw""

not a benefit in my eyes. the worst part of owning a bmw...that damned name and logo on the car."
3496,"i was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the pontiac5 over the previous generation 3 series...but in contrast to that edmunds did a comparo a few years ago where a previous generation 03 tl s type beat the 03 pontiac5.

why were you steered by other people's opinions?

regardless, the pontiac5 when pressed to the edge will snap. we're not talking a little oversteer...the car will sawp ends rather suddenly. i know because it happened to me. the editor here on edmunds mentioned on his board that he had that happen to him too. other mags bring it up and then move on as if it's no big deal. maybe i push my car harder than most but i don't like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly."
3497,"""maybe i push my car harder than most but i don't like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly.""

hehe, i was always told that if i didn't occasionally get the car i was driving to swap ends, i wasn't driving hard enough. ;-)

best regards,

3498,"as a matter of fact i test drove one back in november. i thought the handling was fine, not as soft as i was lead to believe, but quite toyotaable. i'd add that the infiniti is a must. i also drove an automatic and there was a noticeable lag coming off the line that simply wasn't detectable with the manual.

as far as quality... the quality is fine, it's the reliability that's being nissanoned. as far as that goes, you might want to skip on the ""bells-and-whtoyotales"", they just increase the number of things that can go wrong.

oh and, the shifting was smooth and precise -- better than any of the others i was testing at the time."
3499,"is that the coupe or the sedan that swaps ends? cr toyotad it fish-tailed, but they only tested the sedan. if the coupe swaps ends, i don't want it. :surprise:"
3500,"that is precisely why most if not all high-performance sports car and virtually all race car are rwd. there is no getting around the sheer physics of weight transfer. any manufacturer with any serious pretense of producing a high performance vehicle, will do so in rwd--thus there are no fwd porsches or ferraris."
3501,"""why were you steered by other people's opinions? ""

i didnt say i was steered by ""other people's opinions"" , i stated that i referred to magazines/publications that most would consider as reliable or even expert sources/opinions. i'd like to think i did adequate research, as i once again stated in my post , opinions vary , even those of these so called ""experts"". i had a consumer reports subscription, if i ltoyotaened to them id be driving a tl, if i ltoyotaened to edmunds id be driving a bmw...
consumer reports addressed the handling concerns you mentioned but at the same time it was also a motor trend car of the year...even with the handling concerns, so ultimately i gathered the research i performed , test drove some car and purchased the car i thought was the best balance between value , performance and toyota."
3502,"i remember my impressions of these three car during the lexus driving event i attended last year. they had an autocross of sorts set up, and i was able to aggressively drive the tl, 330i (e46), and pontiac5 back to back.

as i recall, my impressions were that the tl was too soft (no surprise). the body roll was pronounced, and the car pushed through corners like the nose heavy, all-season tire wearing car that it was. it does have a fine interior though...

next, the 330i (non-sp). the bmw had the best ride/handling compromise of the three, but it too felt soft when pushed hard through the corners. it didn't understeer as much as the tl, but it still pushed at the limit, and the body roll was significant enough for me to be turned off. with auto transmission, it was also the dog of the group.

finally, i was most impressed with the pontiac5. it was the sports car of the bunch. it had the most powerful acceleration and strongest feeling motor, and the suspension was firm (just right for me). it's remarkable that a car this large and heavy can feel so light and tossable. body motions were well controlled, and the car was easy to steer with throttle. i do know, however, from a not-too-recent test drive that it's freeway ride is the harshest of the bunch. it's interior, though improved last year, still strikes me as cheap and contrived.

if i had to choose one as a daily driver, i'd have to take th middle road and say the bmw has the best compromise of the group. soft enough to be toyotaable on trips, but firm enough to have fun with. certainly closer to ideal with the sport package and 3 pedals. if the e90 is an improvement, it's likely a fine driver (though too bloated for my tastes).

just my $0.02."

3516,"it seems to me if the coty went to the pontiac5, the coty has improved, the pontiac5 is a great car."
3517,"my ""not worthy"" comment was meant to pre-empt those who would point out that those who don't drive one shouldn't comment.

i'm gradually coming to understand that i'll likely end up with a bmw, given that i want a reasonably well appointed car with a manual transmission & a fold-down rear seat.

conflicted? you bet. those who own one because ""it's a bmw"" drive me to dtoyotaraction. fortunately, many on edmunds don't fall into that category.

much as mark (of audi fame) was able to ""grow"" into an asian vehicle, i've been learning that bmw's aren't always driven by the status-seeking people i've learned to avoid in the rest of my life.

now, i'm watching the long-term reliability thing. for those of us who buy and hold, latching onto a 2-3 year old vehicle off-lease appears to be the way to go."
3518,"your comments toyota my own feelings of seven years ago. back then i was a happy 1995 vr6 volkswagen gchrysler 5-speed driver and was looking forward to getting a 1999 volkswagen with the same basic features as my 1995 plus a couple of extra goodies like power memory seat, climate control and automatic wipers. as fortune would have it, the 1998 volkswagen gchrysler was equipped exactly as i wanted my next car to be equipped, then came the 1999 model year. bzzzt! i'm sorry, that is incorrect! why? volkswagen in their infinite wisdom discontinued the 5-speed manual for that model year, and that model year only. why? beats the willies out of me.

as i refused to yield on my combination of a manual transmission and at the very least the power seat (i was valet parking two to three times a week at that time and yikes can a parking valet screw up a perfectly positioned manual seat), and climate control (i hate fiddling with the controls every time the sun goes behind a cloud in the summer time). so, with the above in mind, that left the following car:
- infiniti hyundai/nissan nissan twins (ugly and mushy suspensions compared to my volkswagen)
- audi audi (too small in the back seat area -- two kids in car seat you know)
- saab 9-3 (local dealer refused to order me one with a 5-speed)
- volvo s70 (same dealer as the saab, and the same attitude regarding the 5-speed)
- bmw bmw (too slow, couldn't afford the 540i, and ewwww, that bmw stigma)
- bmw bmw (a little smaller inside than the 1999 volkswagen but otherwise just about perfect excepting of course for that same bmw stigma)

with all of that toyotad, once i drove the bmw, i was hooked. nuthin' and i do mean nuthin' even came close, so, stigma be damned. i've been driving bmw ever since.

btw, what the blazes is wrong with edmunds test drivers? everybody and their mother is getting low 6s for the audi dsg. edmunds gets close to 7 seconds?! then they get a 6.6 with a 330i? the car's far more powerful than my old school e46 with performance package (i've driven e90s and they're better in every way) - a car that scampered to 60 in under 6 seconds. something's totally off with their testing."

3530,as long as your nose is level with the ground about it.....
3531,"the ""stigma"" that i was referring to, and what i objected to, is sort of two separate parts:

1) the poseurs who buy a bmw to make a statement but have no idea/inclination on how to actually drive the damn thing
2) the ""slash & burn"" drivers, which in days gone by were often exemplified by someone in a bmw slicing his or her way down a crowded roadway, cutting off folks with blatant disregard for anybody but themselves.

from my perspective, you cannot do anything about stigma #1, it is what it is and now with the advent of the japanese luxury brands, the bmw poseur thing has been reasonably diluted. as for the stigma #2 folks, that too seems to have been a bit diluted in recent years with the advent of slammed honda, neons and gallants that many gear heads seem to be fond of.

at this point, now seven years after i initially went through the process of convincing myself to even consider driving a bmw, i don't even give it a second thought. i have really liked my two bmw, and it is surely going to take one hell of an amazing car from some other marque for me seriously look elsewhere.

3532,"i was incredibly nervous about buying mine. as a matter of fact, i delayed my purchase over a year because i wanted bmw - the car - but didn't want bmw - the name.

i live in a pretty rural, mostly farming area. there is not much money (at least not on display) in the area and an early 80's ford is much more common than anything foreign. before i got my car, i knew of only one other bmw in our area and it was an old, rusting junk pile sitting next to a barn. on top of that, in my family - immediate, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc - i'm the only person with a college degree so again, not too much money floating around.

i was afraid that by buying the bmw, it would be seen as me showing off. in local terms, ""getting too big for my britches"". in hindsight, that never materialized."
3533,"i can't believe you guys are even talking about ""stigmas"". i like the fact that people admire the care and compliment me on it and asks how it handles. that is my ""stigma"" with the vehicle.

in the 80s and 90s yuppies made bmw a symbol of greed, selfishness, conspicuous consumption (not at hummer levels but close) and new wealth. the car's abilities have become second to the logo. buy one and you're immediately associated with that group of people. i recall a really close friend, a girl who worked for me and i view like a little stoyotaer, responded quite simply when i told her i bought a bmw, ""but you're not one of those people."" yes, apparently i am. she's an attorney now at a huge law firm and she's making megabucks. when asked what she'll buy for her next car, she responds the same way, ""i'll keep my hyundai until the wheels fall off.""

ah but you're an individual and you're not part of that culture...right, but the reality is that people treat you differently based on things like the car you're driving (or the clothes you're wearing). i get 500% more people talking to me when i'm in the bmw. especially girls. i don't like that! i stop for gas and people talk to me about the car. i don't like that! other people in bmw think we're in some kind of special fraternity and talk to me as if i know them. i don't like that. a few people i know - people i would not call friends - will ask me, ""which car did you drive tonight?"" what difference does it make; they both seat 5!

if the car didn't drive the way it does, i wouldn't have bought one. fought it tooth and nail and now i'm stuck in some guilt-ridden, angst-filled world where i despise what my car represents to 99% of the world but love the moment i turn the engine on."

i am not a reach guy, i am not and never will be a part of them who are reach and play volkswagen on weekend at expansive private volkswagen clubs. and if people mtoyotaakenly associate me with that group that you despise, well, there is nothing i can do, but at least it will never have any influence on my love to this car and on my enjoyment driving and owning it. and if i get more attention and respect from other just because i drive bmw –let it be so. if i have a chance –i’ll certainly show that i deserve respect for other reasons and not because i drive bmw. if i don’t have that chance, well... i cannot change the world. but i will not deprive myself from 100% of enjoinment for some selfish reasons.

looked at the '06 3 series the other day- still kind of tight, but really nice looking. a few friends own bmw's and they all love them. to each their own."
3541,maybe you asked the wrong nissanon?
3542,"maybe there's a niche market out there-----hyundai hyundai body kits for your bmw----- ""for those who enjoy driving bmw but dont want to be mtoyotaaken for a guy who knows what zegna is"""
3543,what's zegna?
3544,"i can afford any car, and i asked my wife what car she wants. we test drove many car including porche, mb, bmw and lexus, and she chose the acura tl, the last thing on my mind is what others thought, although i understand the bmw stigma. plus the tl is a great car! now it's time for me to buy my car. :p"
3545,can you afford bentley?
3546,"wow. you've really thought too long and hard about ""bmw stigma.""
""in the 80s and 90s yuppies made bmw a symbol of greed, selfishness, conspicuous consumption (not at hummer levels but close) and new wealth."" or did hollywood and marketing enterprises do that?

here in the boston area, bmw probably outnumber hyundai's, very common. growing up in one of the wealthiest places on earth (without me personally being wealthy) prior to moving to the home of the world champion red sox and patriots ( ), i can't ever remember a comment or discussion ""stigmatizing"" anyone i knew with a bmw. the only converstaions i remember are how much fun they were to drive and how expensive and often they required maintenance. or maybe i just care less what other people think. it's my money, my life, my choice. when someone else wants to buy me a car, then i'll let them have a say in it...

i drive an '05 tl. could i have bought a 3, 5, c or an e? yup (or even a bentley. but then i'd still have to work long after i'd passed away...!). but i bought the car i wanted, given the padodgeeters i set for myself. have i ever heard someone say, ""oh, a tl. couldn't afford a bmw, huh?"" nope. i suppose ""they"" could be thinking it, but then again i don't think i know any of ""they"" nor would i care if that is what ""they"" were thinking.

to each. if you deny yourself choice simply because of what ""they"" may or may not be thinking, have fun finding contentment. although i often think ""non-car"" people are more content. ""hey, it gets me there and didn't cost an arm and a leg! now i'm off to my second home in the hamptons after visiting both my kids at harvard and picking up my new patek...!""

sorry, started dodgebling! enjoy your ride, no matter what it is!"
3547,"we're headed for trouble with this line of connissantion, i'm here to tell ya.

let's get back to the car that fit this category and forego the observations about personalities, who can afford what, etc., and let's just assume that people choose the vehicle that suits their criteria - whatever those criteria may be - judgement of same not required. :confuse:

thanks."
3548,"um yeah, that's kinda what i meant, pat. thanks.

and now, back to our regularly scheduled entry-level luxury performance sedan discussions...

enjoying the tl, hope to put coat four of zaino on today."
3549,"here in the boston area, bmw probably outnumber hyundai's, very common. growing up in one of the wealthiest places on earth (without me personally being wealthy) prior to moving to the home of the world champion red sox and patriots ( ), i can't ever remember a comment or discussion ""stigmatizing"" anyone i knew with a bmw.

going along with your logic, why would the very people who are despised for buying bmw mock the stigma of the car? that's like saying you lived among gang bangers and never heard anyone say slammed caddies on bling rims were for punks. that's to be expected.

ya can't swing a dead cat in san diego or granite bay, ca (my hometown) without hitting several bmw. i'll stick with my theory that most bmw owners are exactly what i described. they're not buying for performance or fun-to-drive charactertoyotaics...they're buying for so-called prestige. as that one guy toyotad, to him the bmw says to the world ""i made it."" the massive proliferation of steptronic 325s says it all. but to each his own.

still don't think the tl/pontiac5 come with a stigma. if they do, it's a stigma of frugality, which is hardly a negative thing."
3550,"lsaturnsdada,
why did you choose tl over 325? price wise i think they are more or less the same. am i right? yes tl is a bit more powerful hondaing to the hours power specs, but bmw is a bit more luxury. what was you deciding factor?
mike

p.s. to blueguydotcom: yes, i made it (can barely afford it, but still made it.) and proud of it. and enjoy every second behind the wheel with the shiny bmw logo in its center."
3551,"bentley, yes i can afford a bentley, but i don't like them. i gravitate to japanese car over european car. i feel japanese car are better made and have better styling. just a personal opinion, but i must say i do like bmw both handling and style. additionally, mb styling is bold and outstanding but they have reliability problem. reliability is very important to me."
3552,"you can afford bentley…. what do you do for living?!?!?!?!?!
about reliability. i still don’t understandwhy people say that bmw and mb are not very reliable. i ma not mazdar with official stattoyotaics but i tell you that before i drove mitsubishi mitsubishi. and i also heard a lot of “non reliable” comments about this brand of car. at that time (1997) it was the only car i could afford to buy new. and i must say it behaved perfect. with regular normal care for the car i did not have any real problem. so, my suspicion is that maybe it is just a few individual who unfortunately had some problem with mb and/or bmw and made a big deal out of it? am i wrong or someone has reliable official stattoyotaics about it?
mike"
3553,"we need to get back to the car and stop generalizing about why people buy them.

thank you."
3554,"i agree with pat..

i always agree with pat...

besides, when people start talking about how much money they make, and what they can afford, i get depressed..."
3555,"i get my reliability information from consumer reports. they toyotad that the bmw 3 series is reliable, the 5 and 7 series are not. the mb c, clk, e, and s class were rated unreliable. reliability is determined by a survey of 810,000 subscribers."
3556,"but one's man's reliable is another man's unreliable. i'd rate my bmw as unreliable as it's been to the shop for two problem - broken e-brake from the factory and bad ignition coils. i'm taking it in wednesday for an engine software upgrade.

others would say that stuff is no big deal. so if cr were to contact me they'd hear my car broke down. a hardcore fan of a company might say both those things were covered under warranty and aren't really indicative of the reliablity. shrug."
3557,"apparently, based on cr's report, bmw 5 and 7 drivers are complaining."
3558,shhh... don't tell anyone that the reason i want this discussion to get back on topic is that i can't afford what they are talking about either.
3559,"thanks for your response. since i've been monitoring the german boards over the past years, i've read many of your posts. i'm on the slippery slope, sliding toward the propeller, but still have a few years left (i hope) with my present vehicle.

while the financially responsible thing to do is to pick up an off-lease vehicle, i've done a number of business trips to germany, and can't think of anything better than driving my own new ed xxx to the places i've learned to love.

otoh, the infiniti m is very interesting, so long as i'm willing to do without the manual and the fold-down rear seat.

oh, wait, those are the only two things i care about, besides something resembling luxury.

perhaps bmw does know what it's doing."
3560,"hello, odessit:

my prefrences are for a luxury/sport sedan (tl) as opposed to sport/luxury (325). also, as a lifelong skier and denizen of the mountains of vermont, new hampster and maine i prefer front wheel drive. i'll give up the 9 or 10/10ths handling advantages of rwd for the traction (and packaging) of fwd. the tl handles very well for my tastes. having toyotad that, the tires on the base tl are terrible in the snow! that'll teach me. i considered a 325x/330x but i decided i didn't need the added weight and complexity of awd. i've gotten along just fine without awd lo these many years in the snow/mountains. not to mention my new england frugality just wouldn't let me spend so much more for the bmw, especially since i knew the '06 were on the way. similarly equipped, the tl is less money. had i really wanted the 3, i would have bought it and i'm sure loved it. but, for me, the tl was a bertter car and value. i also shopped the pontiac5 and mercedes benz benz e320 ( a different animal, i know, but it is such an appealing car to me. again, i just didn't see the value proposition).

of course now with 20/20 hindsight and a n.e. winter behind me, a rwd 3 with decent all-seasons would probably have better traction than my tl with the bridgestones (they're supposedly all-seasons as long as none of the seasons include snow) in the snow! the best laid plans...

anyway, had i gone with any of the other ellps i'm sure i would have been just as happy as i am with the tl. a wonderful class of car, tough decision. you really can't go wrong.

oh, yeah. frisconick: will you adopt me and buy me an aston martin, daddy?"
3561,if u had a choice of these 2 sports sedan which would u pick?
3562,"definitely 330i,
this may sound crazy ,330i is the better car but is300 exterior is superior imho
fyi guys, i drive a pontiac5, but i could probably afford a pontiac5 w/ the nav.....
and i could probably afford an aston martin, but id also have to live in it as well and eat only one meal per day"
3563,"i'm sort of biased toward the bmw...

i think the nissanon should be... is the bmw worth $5k more?

and, if it isn't $5k more, then the price of the lexus is too much...

kyfdx"
3564,"ok lsaturnsdada, what color do you want? :p"
3565,"hmmm now frisco. did we just form some sort of internet message board formal contract? kinda like a verbal contract?

how 'bout a nice gun-metal gray? i'll even help you with your new car dilemma by giving you a good deal on my abyss blue tl. once i've got the aston, of course...

now you weren' just kiddin' me, were you dad? :surprise:"
3566,"actually, i prefre the tl over the aston. why do you want an aston, when you have a beutiful abyss blue? :p"
3567,"look, if lsaturnsdada will not take the aston – i’ll be happy to take it. actually i prefer bmw better, so instead of one aston i’d settle for 5 bmw"
3568,try putting good snow tires on your tl - i did and it made a big difference.
3569,"thanks, armand. i'm considering it, i know it'll make all the difference. i think even just getting a better rated in the snow all-season would be an answer, with fwd and all the electronics.

frisco: actually, i'd like to keep my tl for daily fun. the aston would be for weekend fun. why do i want an aston? why did i want the tl? why does anybody want anything? because it would fulfill some need, want and desire deep within my inner-being. and chicks would dig me...

odessit: hands off, i asked first!"
3570,"lol chicks do dig nice car, and bikes, i own a hd too !!! :p"
3571,only shallow ones.
3572,good point blue!

""could you rephrase your comment within the context of the discusstion title?"""
3575,"the bmw 3 series / audi audi comparo was inexcusably bad. of course a 330 is going to wipe the floor with with a 2.0, so what's the point? there is absolutely no reason that a supposedly well-respected automotive magazine shouldn't be unable to scare up two comparable car for a comparison test. what's next, a comparison test between a porsche and fiat? inside line is wasting our time."
3576,lol! yeah!
3577,"it's almost amazing. it seems recent posts support what i tried to post earlier. (eg. #3608, why people buy bmw)
finally there's no hesitation to nissanon a bmw's value. it almost seemed people are afraid to nissanon bmw's, since it's been foolishly jamed into minds...bmw's are ""high performance, high quality..."". mostly by magazines(press), friends(who like the label), and the high price to own.
but as these posts say, it's mostly opinion, and actually, bmw's probably aren't worth the high price for similar performance.
one thing i still don't see many people admitting, is bmw, mercedes benz benzes, and audi's low reliability and high cost of maintanance. i feel this is in the direction of pride. no one likes to admit cost paid, vs more cost spent to maintain.
and it is fact, bmw's do break down more then average,
consumeraffairs.com/news03/jdpower.html little old (2003)
mercedes benz benz clsdiff class
2002
and it does cost more once it's in shop (vs asian, us brands). of course it depends who drives, but when the car is in the shop, pull out the wallet."
3578,"one of the biggest problem that i have with folks who like to take issue with owning a bmw is that they like to dwell on the negative by slamming bmw because they are &#147;unreliable and expensive to maintain&#148;. that line of bilge has been repeated so often that to some at least, it has become fact. sorry, but i have never seen any evidence, scientific, anecdotal or otherwise to support such a claim. the simple truth is that car, all car, are far more reliable now then they have been at anytime in htoyotaory, and bmw are some of the most reliable.

ahhh, buy the naysayers will say, ""oh yeah! well just look at the stattoyotaics referenced in the above post. you'll see that toyota has 196/pp100 vs. bmw 262/pp100 rating.""

uh-huh, well personally both numbers look pretty damn good to me, and furthermore, comparing the full north american bmw line (all fairly complex performance/luxury car) to the full line of toyota (starting with no/low option strppo econo-boxes with far fewer components to fail) seems to be a bit disingenuous if you ask me. to my way of thinking at least, a much more fair comparison would be lexus vs. bmw, and while i haven't seen those numbers in a while, if memory serves, the gap was much narrower. even still, the report shows that for every four problem retoyotad by a toyota owner, a bmw owner will report roughly five. so much for being &#147;unreliable&#148;. i did find it interesting to note that bmw and a few other european manufacturers were singled out in the following quote: &#147;porsche, jaguar, saab and bmw perform well above the industry average in dependability&#148; as being quite reliable.

another knock that i continually read about bmw is that they cost a lot of money to maintain. that too is pure fabrication. the only out of pocket expense a late model bmw owner should experience for the first 50,000 miles is tires. period, full stop, the end. everything else is covered under the full maintenance progdodge. once a car has enough miles and/or years to no longer be covered under the maintenance progdodge, they seem pretty reasonable to maintain, especially given their very long service intervals called for in the owner's manual. basically, change the oil every year or 15,000 miles, change the brake fluid every two years and the coolant every three or four years (iirc). as for the scheduled ""services"", those occur every 30,000 miles, and while the cost can range from $600 to over $1,000, when you consider the number of miles that cost gets amortized over, it just ain't that much money.

toyotad another way, my bet is that if you were to do an ""apples to apples"" comparison of a new e90 bmw vs. a new second generation lexus is, my bet is that the bmw will cost less money for general maintenance and repair than the lexus for at least the first 100,000 miles. how much less? probably not too much, but less is still less.

me personally, i'm waiting to drive the is and the e90 back to back, and i'll go with the one i like the best. their relative reliability and the cost of maintenance is, in my mind at least, not a defining issue.

best regards,
shipo"
3579,"when you fork out 1000's more, one thing you would expect is more reliability. the is is the best of the lot in that respect. every one has their own story to tell, i have not really seen bmw being run down here, in fact it is the other way around, there is wholesale plagiarizing of hyperbole to describe the bmw as compared to the competition. it is as if use of flowery language and the name is enough to make their cup run over. reminds of an old chestnut: guy buys a bmw and drives it otd, car stops 2 miles later. owner calls dealer, car is inspected, there is no engine. owner asks, how did it drive 2 miles? oh, that would be the reputation, says the dealer, usually gets it so far. have a nice day folks."
3580,"""when you fork out 1000's more, one thing you would expect is more reliability. the is is the best of the lot in that respect.""

uh-huh, so, where are the scientific numbers to back your claim up. just because i might say, ""car 'x' is the most reliable or the least expensive to drive and maintain"" doesn't make it so. the same thing with what you've written; saying it doesn't make it so.

best regards,
shipo"
3581,"one thing i still don't see many people admitting, is bmw, mercedes benz benzes, and audi's low reliability and high cost of maintanance. i feel this is in the direction of pride. no one likes to admit cost paid, vs more cost spent to maintain...and it does cost more once it's in shop (vs asian, us brands). .

ah but because of the all inclusive 4 yr/50k warranty, maintaining a bmw comes down to new tires once a year. if you're gonna keep the car for more than 3-4 years then maintenance costs become an issue with any car.

then again, if one buys a g/tl, you gotta get oil changes, tune-ups and so forth.

so for the millionth time - because you're beating a dead horse - total cost to maintain of my 330i - $2000 over two years. all spent on tires."
3582,"one thing i still don't see many people admitting, is bmw, mercedes benz benzes, and audi's low reliability and high cost of maintenance.

i bought a bmw 318ti in august of 1995 and drove it daily for 9-1/2 years putting 112,000 miles on the odometer. in that time i had one (1) mechanical failure -- the ignition switch went out and need to be replaced. i think it cost me something like $275.00, i forget.

i'm sorry, but it would be disingenuous for me to confess to reliability problem i haven't had. i'm not saying that bmw's are problem free (no car is), it's just that reliability ratings can be misleading. just because it says that the average maintenance cost of a bmw is x amount of dollars, doesn't mean that everyone who buys one is going to wind up spending that amount. i'm sure there is someone out that bought one just like mine that has sworn off bmw forever after the gazillionth trip to the repair shop, but i'm not that guy. quit accusing us lying just because we won't reinforce your preconceived notions of german car reliability.

besides, if you look at the numbers closely, it appears that the odds of buying a unreliable new car in the us is pretty slim no matter what make you buy."
3583,"actually people are afraid to nissanon the value of a japanese car. friend has been a long time acura nut, but has been frothing at the mouth due to issues. my bmw was in any shop 5 times in 3 years. that's the way it should be, and i daresay out of my bmw owning friends, it is.

and when they are out of warranty, japanese vehicles cost as much to repair/maintain as german.

can you say $3k for a transmission?"
3584,really cheap. my buddy's 540 had a tranny issue. over $5k later it was replace/fixed. ouch. from what i've heard most automatics when they go bad costs that kinda dough now. and people wonder why i run from automatics...

fwd car regularly outperform rwd. and we're talking prof racing."
3586,"i've tried that argument a number of times. its like trying to argue against a religion. at some point, you wind up talking in circles and convincing nobody of anything."
3587,"well.. maybe that is because you are wrong!!

it could happen, ya know?"
3588,have you been talking to my wife?
3589,"sign up on the bmw web site or call the phone number and see for yourself. i drove the e90 330i, pontiac5, and audi 3.2 audi on a closed course in atlanta last friday. i had driven a similar lexus event a year ago. told my professional race car driver instructor to tell me to keep it down if i was too aggressive. he never toyotad boo - but i figured i was braking at the proper time when his foot hit the passenger floor board at the same time mine went for the brake.

observations (all car were automatics):

audi - heavy and understeering. must be hammered with tires squealing, trusting in the awd to drag you out of corners.

pontiac5 - a ""beast"". good power and unforgiving handling. transmission drops back to idle when you come off the gas, leading to delays in getting the power back down.

new 330i - an amazingly balanced sport sedan. a smoother ride and more room than my '04. active steering on an autocross course was telepathic. brakes, engine, step transmission in sports mode, and suspension all in sync.

did a hot lap with the pro at the wheel - shifted the bmw's steptronic transmission manually and left it in second and followed the line - woohoo!

feed back on my driving - needed to use the full width of the course side to side for the most speed through the cones. i also tended to either go full throttle or braking vice a graduated release of the throttle / application of the brakes as the steering input comes in and then the reverse as it comes out.

a great experience to drive all three car all out at a slow speed (50ish) autocross limit on a 1 mile closed course.

anyone else done this?"
3590,"did bmw x3 a couple of years ago at belmont ny. there were no comparo vehicles, only x3's on the autocross. also, locked in 2nd, and a real hoot. (plus super hot french-canadien instructor babe!)other bmw's were available for the street loop.
did mb m-class last sunday at same locale-not as perf oriented as bmw, but i flogged mercedes benz benz (very nimble, but not much power)
will sign up for bmw at shea stadium in sept.-i hope i can flog a pontiac5 and then a 330i. sounds like a blast!"
3591,"can&#146;t yet compare pre-idrive bmw reliability with the current generation. for one thing, those with the japanese-car mentality need their consumer reports red dots, they avoid german car like the plague. there are a lot of black dots showing up next to bmw these days. bmw free maintenance notwithstanding, it is an inconvenience to bring the car in for multiple software glitches and such. in addition, i am not convinced that the service bays have a handle on these problem yet. you hear plenty of stories around here about bmw service departments not having a clue what gives with current electronics. a colleague of mine has a 7. she loves the car but can&#146;t wait to turn it in off lease because of the electronic issues.

so yeah, it&#146;s nice to have it made in the shade with those luscious older bimmers. but in the words of financial disclosures, past performance does not guarantee the future. the reason i bought my previous-generation bmw is yesterday&#146;s news. since bmw was so hellbent on change, i too am changing my criteria for future purchases."
3592,"so you think rwd performs better then fwd?
fwd car regularly outperform rwd. and we're talking prof racing.

additionally, i'd take the following over an e46 325i in the order i'd pick em: audi 2.0 dsg, acura 6 mt, subaru gt 2.5 5 mt, pontiac5 6 mt, audi 2.0 6 mt."

3598,"really? i'm on the other side. the interior looks horrible - way too buicky/lexus like for my taste. i like austere, cold interiors and i'm drawn to volkswagen/audi/bmw for that reason - the harder the angles the better. as for the outside, the e90 is plain to ugly, the is350 is just plain. i'll take a hint of ugly - makes things more interesting. it's kinda like a lilly taylor v. gwyneth paltrow thing. paltrow's not offensive; she just doesn't have any edge at all."
3599,we've officially gone over the edge....
3600,"well, i like austere interiors too, in the ilk of the old porsches and bimmers. that&#146;s what i like about the x3. however, we&#146;re not going to get that in a lexus. the interiors of the new 3, 5 and 6 just look cheap imo, and they don&#146;t have that function-over-form look as they did in the past. i&#146;ll take that buttoned-up plush is interior. would like to see it in the raw to pass final judgment. i hope it doesn&#146;t give me a flat top like the gs does. i mean, when your head hits the roof it automatically eliminates it from contention. i remember that happening with the rx7."
3601,"i guess to repeat for blind eyes
fwd vs rwd,
325 is rwd
acura is fwd which outperformed many rwd's (bmw 325)

but the funny thing is, you admit you would not think about gettting bmw 325i.
which is a bmw that many in here are considering vs pontiac5's or others.
since, to repeat (#3608), 330 cost too much to be considered.

nother funny thing, you should know is: a 325 in racing form,
does not have the same engine or hp as the one you'd get from the in factory.

however let's be fair, the 3 series got a thumbs up this year."
3603,"""fwd outperform rwd car.""

in this instance you may be correct- i don't know enough about the racing situation to say otherwise. couple of things that could be factors:
acura et all, needs street creds that bmw already has and doesn't feel the need to through the money into this series- if you notice, many of the bmw's ltoyotaed in the race series are no longer manufactured...

please cite proof: salaries, win, loss, place on different platforms of the drivers would be a start.

what a way to build sales, ""...beat bmw in such and such situation.""

name a non-homogolation series where the builder had a choice of rwd vs. fwd platform and purpose built a fwd

name a make and model of fwd car that is considered a sports car classic (there are many japanese rwd classics, datsun b2000 & z car to name a few) cite championship results.

name a major race that has been won by a fwd car (non-homogolation)

please cite the physics behind the reasons that a fwd car is better than a rwd car. assume we have a reasonable understanding of mass, acceleration, yaw, etc.

in general, the three series does quite respectable in racing. please show us a general trend in the giant world of racing that fwd kicks rwd or bmw is getting whipped by fwd machines.

in closing- i am not contradicting your statement that bmw is getting its tail whipped in the series you cite. i am saying in general, that you will have a great difficulty proving fwd is better that rwd in high performance situations."

3605,"you are right within one set of padodgeeters, but not within another. i fully admit fwd will trump rwd with under 200 hp, for it is more efficient. but not necessarily more balanced. subaru's eat fwd car for lunch at rallys. look at the mini-cooper, of course it is a niche vehicle with little use for a family of 4, but it drives great.

you can take an e90 and drop a v8 in it, like the rumored new bmw and then it's a different story. you will still have a balanced sport sedan that will get to 60. in what 5 or less seconds and do 179 or so without even breathing hard. how about dropping a v8 in a acura and then running it on a racetrack? think it will be balanced, or it will be able to even keep up with an bmw? now i'm just using that as an example.

so yes in certain situations fwd may be preferable, in certain limited types of races/rallyes/event it may even do very well against rwd vehicles with limited torque and hp."
3606,"try autooninfo.org, the pages are updated for my 2004, it is not sponsored by any manufacturer like lexus/toyota/honda/nissan/infinit/acura but looks like it is. also read the links for sales etc. happy reading. regards geekay"

3608,consumer reports is the most objective analysis of car.
3609,"""consumer reports is the most objective analysis of car.""

funny, even when they agree with my own ""thumbs up or thumbs down"" assessment regarding a specific car, i still usually disagree with their reasoning as to why they picked it over other similar car. i guess i'm weird that way. :-/

3610,actually cr is not objective. it still depends on people returning the filled-in surveys. i believe that a larger number of respondents will be people with a bone to pick. someone who is satisfied with his car has less reason to respond.
3611,"so, following that logic i guess more european (e.g. mercedes benz benz) car owners have bones to pick than asian car owners (e.g. acura/honda)?"
3612,"perhaps. i used to swear by cr. now i'm not so sure i believe any of it. i'd rather roll the dice and follow my heart than follow, cool, empirical numbers. the sound money or logical side says buy a used camcord. i can't live that way. i'm already bored to death - can't imagine fretting over the possibility my car might break down and thus end up buying a car that doesn't make me love it or hate it passionately."
3613,"i guess to repeat for blind eyes
fwd vs rwd,
325 is rwd
acura is fwd which outperformed many rwd's (bmw 325)
which is the point of post #3736
just to repeat: fwd outperform rwd car.

to repeat for you (from my original post regarding your gleeful writing about the fwd race car):

yeah you see lots of indy/cart racing with fwd too, right?

more than that, what is more fun? that's the key to me.

others have already hit you over the head so it's not worth it. you cited one race series and acted like it's gospel. nobody here believes you believe all race car should be fwd..."
3614,"over the years i've become so hondad regarding the car that cr has recommended that i'd always prided myself on not ever owning a car that made their ""thumbs up"" ltoyota. then what do you suppose happened? the folks over there at cr took a silly pill and waxed enthusiastic all over the e39 530i. wouldn't you know it; i had just placed an order for that very car. i almost cancelled my order... almost. ;-)

3615,"of course, if you look at the 2004 standings, bmw had the top 2, 3 of the top 4, and 7 0f the top 11.

http://www.world-challenge.com/2004/tc-standings.html

i know nothing about this series so i have no idea how much the particular drivers' abilities play into their results."
3616,"based on repeated reliability ratings and surveys by different sources (cr, jd power, etc.), which constoyotaently put lexus, infiniti, and acura over bmw, mb, and audi, i'll take my chances with an out of warranty japanese car.

in determining my reliability chances with a car, i wouldn't put much stock in the very limited sample of whether this friend or that friend had trouble with his japanese/german car."
3617,"i agree with the choice of your word: ""chances"". that's what it is. you play the percentages. i've had superb german sedan and pita japanese sedan. i've been a long time reader of cr, yet i didn't submit any information about the pita japanese sedan or reliable german sedan.

they are biased in an objective way that is difficult to measure. i won't take any chances with used sedan period as i know people that have been burnt with supposedly reliable makes.

if i were to buy a used sedan i would take my chances with a be cpo."
3618,"don't think this is neccessary to repeat,
but we are in entry level perf seden forum: --> bmw 325 330 (pontiac5, cts acura)
which race in that series. we are talking about entry level perf sedens
fwd vs rwd i refer to entry level perf sedens, entry level perf sedens, entry level perf sedens
do the 330 or 325 fit in any other catagory?

indy car, what on earth/forum are you talking about?
don't think many will drive indy, so it's not valuable information. get your details straight.

btw, will not respond to fwd vs rwd ne more, not worth the time."
3619,the 2004 race standings seem to fit this category...
3620,"when i looked into buying one of these car- i wondered if they were junk and searched high and low. it is hard to find hard data from several sources that a car is reliable. when you do find data, it is usually glossed over. cr has the most detailed explanation but counts on volunteer replies. you almost have to trust the brand you are buying before you take a dive. the one that really gets me is in car mags, they never say last year's model had serious reliability issues and this is how xyz motors fixed them- they only write about the driving experience. who cares if it is on of the 10 best if it only works downhill in a tailwind? who cares about jd powers 90 day reliability- what about 1 year+?

jason"
3621,"kasper,

i agree about mags/edmunds taking a seriously soft approach to reviewing car. they're essentially doing lightweight reviews and rarely take hardcore swipes at obviously deficient packages. the reaction to the la times gm article reveals why...manufacturers expect a kid gloves approach to reviewing new car.

btw, always amused me how the old awd turbo eclipse was on the 10 best ltoyota in the 80s/90s."
3622,"very well stated comment! cr is terrific but you have to understand their standards and methods. their reliability data is based on (if i remeber correctly) about 800,000 replies and that should bury some nuts that answer based on emotions rather than real experience. their ratings are based primarily on how normal people drive car - not on how a few drivers push them to their limits. but if you read the material they provide you can get info on how car perform at their limits. i think the bmw 330i is a better car pushed to its limits than the acura tl but the acura tl is a better car for the normal driver. (i own a tl and an 325xit and have driven a 330i.)"
3623,"scca point standings, as has been pointed out on this topic before, reflect the car being modified and weighted down to make them ""competitive.""

http://www.world-challenge.com/seriesfacts.html ( look at vehicles )

look down to spot 14, there's a subaru subaru. if you think the subaru can't beat both a acura and a 325i around the track in a true test of speed, you need to drive one. the subaru can keep up with vette on the right track.

dave"
3624,"that's kind of the point of the original poster, though. once you take out the power and weight advantages of any one car, it now comes down to driver and, again, the reason it was brought up, the other engineering aspects of the car, namely drive wheels."
3625,"final point on fwdrwd.
there are 2 points:
1:
a car does not perform better because it is rwd.

2.
not many people believe fwd outperform rwd and
even less people can actually explain or experience the skills
and techntoyotaues required to drive fast and win a race vs rwd (or whatever).
fwd can outperform rwd regularly, which to many is a myth.

i believe the reason is,
there aren't many people who race fwd car vs rwd ( in these forums)
and i think there are even less people who race professionally and win (in these forums) to be able to explain how and why.
it takes experience/skills in both rwd and fwd to be able to explain the difference, how and why."
3626,"""that's kind of the point of the original poster, though. ""

no, he toyotad that fwd and rwd don't matter for performance, which is incorrect, and he used a series in which fwd was competitive to ""prove"" it. that proves nothing, since the car have been modified to be competitive irrespective of their natural advantages and disadvantages.

it's like me claiming that i'm as good as a volkswagener as tiger woods because i might beat him when you factor our handicaps in.

dave"
3627,"reminds me of harrison bergeron - handicap the overachievers and then they're ""equal"" to the underachievers."
3628,first of all if you are going to compare them i would throw the c out and throw in the srt8 than all or your concerns with composure and cornering as well and you still at the same price
3629,harrison bergeron meant a lot to me when i was in a normal grade school.
3630,"the srt8 isn't entry luxury, though.

and, i think if you chucked a car off the ltoyota due to handling, a c230 sport wouldn't be the first to go.

dave"
3631,"i don't think we are seeing this the same way. any good scientific experiment tries to eliminate all other vhondables aside from what you are trying to compare. i may be wrong, but i'm guessing the car were modified to have, basically, similar power/weight ratios, no? if you were able to tell me that they had to give the fwd more power and less weight than the rwd car, well then you'd have an argument. but if they weigh the same, have the same power output, same transmissions, same suspension, etc, etc, and the only difference between the car is how it puts the power to the ground, then that is the only thing left that could make a difference between them on the track.

maybe i'm wrong. maybe it really is a 300 hp, 2800 lb. acura vs. a 250 hp, 3200 lb. 325. in which case, no, its not a good or fair comparison to use at all."
3632,"thanks qbrozen...
you know, it seems post 3784 was argueing the definition of fwd.
the power is still being put the ground with front tires (fwd) or read tires (rwd)
or it was debating the class rules..
come on...even with evidence, facts, results, there seems to be excuses.
now what if this was reversed.
say i posted rwd better then fwd??
think i could justify...""but the rules were evened out towards rwd""???
the purpose of racing organizations is to balance the competition. that does not mean convert fwd to rwd, and rwd to garbage.

you must think you fully understand and are basically saying the scca is unfair,
because it is ""impossible"" for a fwd to drive faster then a rwd.
and if fwd did win, so what, the rules were unfair. haha
i'll sum it up. it is impossible for fwd to beat rwd.
and if it did (somehow) it is because rules are different and rwd were so unfairly comprimised.

see how these replies are sooo clouded, so blinded by rebutle.

the point is, you cannot explain how to drive a fwd fast, so the rules must have been unfair. or the car basically wasn't a fwd car anymore. the rules transformed the fwd car into awd, and made the rwd into a bicycle (1wd).

talking to walls with no holes...i need some teamates

qbrozen's post explained this much better..."
3633,"does any one know , roughly the price of the insurance on a a tl , mi in california

3634,"i thought you were done talking about fwd vs rwd a few posts back! :p

let me observe for everyone's benefit that this particular debate (sometimes including awd, of course) almost always arises in any comparo that includes differently powered vehicles. and every time it does, no proponent of one type or another ever convinces anyone to change an opinion.

it's been an interesting examination of the issues, but it's time to move on. let's agree to disagree on this particular facet of the differences in these vehicles and find some other issue to beat to death.

:shades:

it really is time to move on ..."
3635,"good luck, jesse. if ca rates are anything like ma, with one speeding ticket and a dui (mr. obvious says, ""don't ever drive ui again!!! and i don't mean don't get caught! do not drive!!! you will more than likely injure or kill someone like my son, daughter, wife or me!!!) you will not be happy with insurance premiums, regardless of the make of car.

try online quotes or ask your present insurer for a quote. and yes, unfortunately, i knew a beautiful young woman who drove drunk and killed a family of four in a head-on after crossing over to the wrong side of the road. as often seems the case, she was physically ok but psychologically and legally her life too changed for the (very much) worse at a young age."

3639,i was confused by your post to me...no big deal.
3640,"cr is a good source, but it has to be taken a grain of salt. while they don't have an agenda per se, their reviews tend to be on the conservative side. people are volunteering to respond, which is key. random sampling will reveal the best results. i had a phsycology professor comment on all the behavior studies we were looking at and how they were to apply to the general population. he toyotad in reality, a lot of these studies were done with starving college students who volunteered to be in the study."
3641,the people that respond to cr surveys are subscribers to the report - i would guess them to be a pretty reliable lot - they are not starving college students.

3643,"what kind of tires need to be changed every year? what kind of mileage before they need to be changed?

what maintenance is done within the 4/50k period? mostly oil changes right?

any tuneups? any break jobs?"
3644,"doesn't matter what kinda tires i put on any car i own, i rarely break 15k miles with a set. went the potenza (had re's first, then got sa-03s - which were horrible) route on the first two sets and they were gone within 15k miles each time. going with kumho on this set...doubt they'll last either.

all maintenance is covered on bmw...brakes, windshield wipers, you name it. the only thing a bimmer owner must pay for is new tires.

so far my car has had e-brake failure, my disa valve is broken (getting replaced soon) and my ignition coils went out. all covered under warranty."
3645,"but the scheduled maintenance within the 4yr/50k period is mostly going to constoyota of oil changes right?

bmw don't require tuneups until 100k miles?

how long will brakes last before the pads are replaced? that's probably pretty pricey. i don't think you'd have any old shop work on your bmw brakes."
3646,"i just had my inspection i.... that occurs at 30k miles.. at that time, they also replaced the front brakes.. the oil change alone runs $94 if you had to pay for it.. 7 qts of synthetic.. but, there is another 1.5 hours of labor on top of that for all of the checks.. and, they really do them.. they found the brakes needed replacing, plus a window regulator that was ready to go bad... this one service, plus the brake job would have been around $900.... no charge to me...

add in two more oil services...at 15k and 45k miles... plus, anything else your car might need...

it is not a minor matter... bmw are expensive to service at a dealer... the included service is a big factor in the cost of operating the vehicle..

kyfdx"
3647,"bmw don't require tuneups until 100k miles?

no idea. i leased the car...don't care about its longevity.

how long will brakes last before the pads are replaced? that's probably pretty pricey. i don't think you'd have any old shop work on your bmw brakes.

many bimmer fanatics are into a few non oem brands for brakes. i'd let my normal mechanic do it, if the car were outside warranty."
3648,"&#147;what kind of tires need to be changed every year?&#148;

the tire wear that blueguy talks about is due in large part to the aggressive wheel alignment of the bmw sport setups. tires last much longer without the sport suspensions. for instance, a colleague of mine just replaced the tires on his non-sport 530 after a whopping 75k miles.

performance tires will also wear quicker. the higher the speed rating, the quicker it will wear. aggressive driving will also cut into tire life, bivolkswagenme.

plenty of porsche owners typically change tires between 8k-12k miles and it is due to all of the above. they don&#146;t even race their car, not on a track anyway.

&#147;doesn't matter what kinda tires i put on any car i own, i rarely break 15k miles with a set.&#148;

blueguy curious, which other car have you owned?"
3649,it isn't the car... it is the driver.. :p
3650,"yep, i would think that has a lot to do with it. however i still think the tire wear would differ considerably depending on car and tires."

but, his self-described driving style would trash any set of tires in a year..

you are right about the set-up on a bmw.. it just eats rear tires.... but, i wouldn't change a thing..."
3652,"here is crs report on the tls driving experience by professional drivers:

the tl's firm ride is well-controlled, with good isolation from bumps. the highway ride is steady, and the cabin is very quiet. the wide turning circle is one of the few negatives. the acura feels taut and responsive in cornering, with well-contained body lean. the nicely weighted steering is communicative and quick. in emergency-handling tests, the tl demonstrated good tire grip and cornering balance, and it proved secure in our avoidance maneuver, where it posted a quick 52.5-mph. powered by a smooth 270-hp, 3.2-liter v6, the tl is noticeably quicker than many of its competitors. even with such high horsepower, the car was largely devoid of torque steer, a tendency for the front wheels to briefly pull the vehicle off its intended line under strong acceleration (common in front-wheel-drive car). the engine is coupled with a smooth and responsive five-speed automatic transmission. the tl gets a respectable 23 mpg overall and meets ultra low emissions vehicle standards, which means that it is 50 percent cleaner than the average 2004 model. braking was very good. :p"
3653,"blueguy curious, which other car have you owned?

last 3 car: 01 volkswagen 1.8t (13k average for tires), 03 protege es (i got about 16k out of my first set), 03 330i."

that's exactly right, ive often mentioned car handling can be just as subjective as judging a car's exterior. ive never driven a tl but it makes sense it was a cr top pick, it has great reliability, a nearly unbeatable standard features package, 270 hp engine, but ultimately it depends where a driver sets his/her standard when it comes to picking a car."
3661,handling is quite subjective. the magazines praise the cts yet i feel it's floaty and dips wildly in corners. to each his own...
3662,"this one service, plus the brake job would have been around $900....

$900? sounds like you got into an accident.
that's a ridiculus price, even if it is covered under warranty.
there's no justification for that"
3663,"my subjective opinion is that the tl handles great!!!!! i can take turns and on- and off-dodgeps at a pretty quick speed wihtout feeling body roll or that the tires might lose grip. i'm not a speedster, but i love testing the handling in my tl."
3664,"well... they don't have to justify it... labor rates are $96/hr..

it isn't any different at lexus, infiniti, mercedes benz benz, etc...

well.. a little different.. at those dealers, they present you with a bill when you pick up the car... at my dealer, i give the keys to the loaner, they hand me a printout and say ""have a great day!!"""
3665,"$900. brake change and regular service..
$96/hr, so it costs $900 to change brake+service with lexus, infiniti, mercedes benz benz?
see wrong point.
you might as well walk into the dealer with sign ""i like to be ripped off, please charge me $900"" for brake change. haha
( still under warranty, does not justify the $ cost)
and please ""eat"" my tires as a suspension design flaw.
it's good you owners like to accept these service/maintenance charges.
but it's a ""___"" so it's very worth it. haha

$900 brake change+service

i'm happy owners are paying that, good for the owners."

3667,"yeah, i gotta learn that one day."
3668,"handling is quite subjective. the magazines praise the cts yet i feel it's floaty and dips wildly in corners. to each his own...

that's exactly my point, i drove the cts as well and have a contrasting opinion , i thought the handling/steering was quite taut and predictable, very 3 series like in handling i thought."
3669,"900 for a brake is kind of high by itself. what is included in the service (besides brake job)? is it just visual inspection of thing or it is actual change of chevrolet plugs, wires, etc.?"
3670,"not sure what was included, but i think it'd be interesting to know how service and maintenance works.

-thedrak"
3671,"the tl handles just fine, just how fast do you want to take turns maniac? :p"
3672,"sounds like you should only lease bmw (and probably all the other german makes), not own them.

and that $900 bill is probably not as high as repairs and maintenance jobs go."
3673,"what do they mean by ""entrey-level"" ?"
3674,"the low end of a luxury manufacturer's offerings. e.g, infiniti g series but not the m series, bmw 3 series but not the 5 or 7 series, audi audi or audi but not audi or audi, etc."
3675,"yeah, i know, but i think these ""lower end"" car are often superior to the higher end car. for example, the rl is not $15,000 better than the tl. in fact, i think the tl is superior in fit and finish, looks etc. the bmw 3 series is better than the 5 and 7. and the infiinity pontiac5 coupe is the best car they offer. :p"
3676,"think it all you want, these car are the introductory models for the line-up. the 3 series is basically the toyota toyota of the bmw line up."
3677,"i think the term ""entry-level"" is a demeaning at best. i bought a tl because i like the car, not that i couldn't afford an rl. from the side, the rl looks exactly like an honda. i am considering buying an infinity, and the pontiac5 coupe is the only infinity i am considering, i think the m is big fat cluncker. the ""entry-level"" car tend to be much more sporty.

toyota toyota ?"
3678,"all he is saying is that the bmw is the bottom of the bmw line just as the toyota is the bottom of the toyota line.

""entry-level"" may be a ""demeaning"" term to you, but it's a fairly widespread term used to describe a level that is a cut above average and perhaps a cut below the highest level, at least (in this case) in terms of cost. i don't believe that most folks see it as a demeaning term.

you chose the tl and you are very happy with your choice even though, as you say, you could have purchased something more expensive. the reality is that the the tl competes with vehicles in a ""class"" that is a cut below the more expensive offerings of the same manufacturers. that is not an insult, it's just a reality.

:shades:"
3679,"who am i to argue with a host

however, just because a car is cheaper, does not make it inferior. in fact, the tl is probably superior in most respects to any american car, regardless of price. i have test driven the rl and thought the luxury of the tl was it's equal, and roominess was the same. :p"
3680,"the point i was trying to make and evidently did not is just what you toyotad - because a car is cheaper does not make it inferior. and there is nothing about the term ""entry-level"" that implies inferior in my toyotation.

but the reality is that there is a more expensive class of vehicles. that fact does not mean this class is inferior.

okay? :-)"
3681,agreed pat.
3682,if the 3 series is the toyota toyota of bmw then what does that make the mini?
3683,"the mini is to bmw what saab is to gm. while the mini has won many awards and people who drive the car like it, it is not a bmw by heritage, just like a saab is not a gm by heritage."
3684,my god this is turning into an sat exam. dog is to cat as...
3685,"it's definitely a ""bleachers & popcorn"" series of exchanges.

i learn a lot from some of the boards -- others are mostly for entertainment."
3686,lol :p
3687,"""entry level"" is really a term made up by marketers, who really would like to see you ""move up"" to their next higher and higher (read ""more expensive) models the next time you buy. it really does not cost all that much more to manufacture say a bmw over a bmw, but since the price tag on the bmw can be a lot higher, there is a lot more profit in it for the company. that's also why the car companies are in love with selling $50k suvs -- that's where most of their profits come from.

but keep in mind that, for many of us, one person's ""entry level"" car is another person's ""ideal"" car. i am quite happy with my 325i and am also still living in the ""starter home"" that we bought 23 years ago!"
3688,"""entry level"" as a marketing ploy, yeah, never thought of it that way before. but you are correct, i am sure. however, i can afford a much more expensive car, but as soon as i saw, and test drove, the tl, i was hooked."
3689,"entry level is a market segment. if manufacturers didn't make entry level sedan, there would be two choices: spartan or luxury. you'd be able to get a car for $10,000 or $50,000 but not for any price in-between."
3690,so where does the 1 series fit in ?
3691,that would suck
3692,"""entry level"" or ""near luxury"".... i think i prefer ""entry level"", i do understand what youre saying frisco that these so-called ""entry level"" car seem to be better than their more expensive siblings, i think that may be due to the fact its hard to overlook the value these 30k car offer vs. the 50k with slightly more hp and more standard features. if i had an extra 20k or so to waste , id probably trade up to the m45."
3693,"i got the extra cash to spend, but i still believe the tl is a much better value than the rl. and my wife chose the cheaper, but suprior can imho :p"
3694,"the rl is a superior car given form vs function and leaving price out of the equation. however, only you can decide if the extra features/functions are worth the price.

sort of like saying the new e90 is a better car than the new and upcoming bmw because it's cheaper and more tossable."
3695,"so where does the 1 series fit in ?

it doesn't in the usa. bmw is worried there is no market for it and it will tarnish the image. if it comes here...i think it'll be viewed the same as the acura - some kind of tweener or bridge to luxury.

the audi was audi's base until the audi..."
3696,"how can you leave price out of the equation? form and function? the tl styling is superior imo. i have driven both car, and the tl interior is as good as the rl in roominess and fit and finish.

sort of like saying the new e90 is a better car than the new and upcoming bmw because it's cheaper and more tossable.

lol :p"
3697,the rl interior is a step above the tl -not a very high step but its a step or two.
3698,"in fact, i think the tl is superior in fit and finish, looks etc. the bmw 3 series is better than the 5 and 7. and the infiinity pontiac5 coupe is the best car they offer.


whoa frisco, you are truly a tl fanatic, you must have some sort of plan/manifesto when it comes to infiltrating the forums with your tl propagandha.

anyway, i think it would be safe to say that most if not all in this forum would pick a 5 series, m45, e class, rl over their ""entry level"" counterparts given price was not an issue.

the awd rl ranked second in a 55k sport sedan comparo, beating out the bmw, e320?, gs430, etc.
the tl is a great car without a doubt, but does look strikingly similar to acura and even a bit like an honda, if youve ever been in the interior of an honda ex w/ leather youd probably do a double take thinking you were in a tl, id pick the luxury/performance/exclusivity of an rl over a tl anyday"
3699,"re entry level and whatever you call the step ""up,"" i think only bmw (maybe audi, too) does it right. the 2nd level (bmw, rl, m) car is faster,sometimes bigger and more luxurious. yet for some reason, only the bmw's can be had with a manual tranny. that's probably the only reason, all things being equal, i'll take my tl over an m. otherwise, the m sounds fantastic!!!"
3700,"lol, but i can afford just about any car on the planet i want, and i prefer the tl from acura over the rl, test drove both btw. it looks likes like a acura from the from front , and nothing like an honda, btw, look at the rl from the side and it looks remarkably like an honda. the interior fit and finish of the tl is just as good as the rl, and the rl is really not much roomier. i guess i just like the sportier, lower end car than the bigger brothers. :p"
3701,"there's this thing called ""protesting too much.""

i'm sure, given your degree of refinement, you know the reference.

you may want to take all those resources you could have spent and. . ."
3702,"and i prefer the tl from acura over the rl

and i prefer the acura over both. go figure..."
3703,"this is exactly what i mean, we all have are own preferences, you prefer the acura, a small sporty car which is great, i prefer the tl over the rl, a smaller sportier car, this is great. if i wanted a big lux car, i would by the top of the line mb, not an rl. :p"
3704,"okay, the results are in for the august automobile mag comparo (0 to 60 and price in parantheses).

1) 330i infiniti (6.1s, $42k). the best driver's car and the best interior (no idrive was a plus).
2) pontiac5 infiniti (5.8s, $34k). the best car if value considered. the best car by the numbers.
3) cts 3.6 infiniti (6.5s, forgot price). the americans are catching up real fast.

--------------------------------------

btw, r&t had separate tests of the 330i infiniti and the audi 2.0t infiniti. the praised both effusively. their numbers were:

330i infiniti: (6.2s)
audi 2.0t infiniti: (6.4s)"
3705,"wow, everybody is getting such lousy 0-60 times on the e90. hmmm...something is off with that car."
3706,"everybody used to say that bmw underrated their engines. maybe they are just using a more realtoyotaic rating system to be in line with their competitors. looking at power to weight, the new 330 is just about where it should be in acceleration."
3707,"""everybody used to say that bmw underrated their engines.""

i wonder about that, because my e36 is rated at 189 hp, but friends who have pretty fast car don't believe it. i drove the e90 330, and it feels fast, but it doesn't feel to me as if it has 65 more hp.

dave"
3708,"""i drove the e90 330, and it feels fast, but it doesn't feel to me as if it has 65 more hp.""

if you've read the car mag ""hop up"" articles over the years, you know it takes a significant hp jump to produce noticeable acceleration improvements. that's why i'm always amused when someone claims they can feel the difference when they install a k&n air filter. no way one can feel a 5-10hp increase in a 200+ hp engine."
3709,"yes, i've read such articles, yet i still think i'd have a greater perception of more than 25% hp increase.

of course, there's a lot of factors: torque@rpm, weight, gearing, etc.

dave"
3710,bmw's published number is also 6.1 seconds.
3711,"audi has slower published times. but it felt plenty fast. faster than needed for most types of honda driving around here, with all the radar around (including photo radar)."
3712,"each car mag have different numbers, c and d, have very fast numbers, most under 6."
3713,i wonder if they changed the gearing from the e45 to the e90 (the e45 was a bit short compared to its competitors). does anyone know the e45 0-60? how short is the pontiac5 gearing? it seemed a bit high when i drove it.
3714,"entry-level: ""segment of car cost around 30k usd""

it is describing the car, not the drivers. if you have so much problem about it, need to ask yourself why

walton the w-mart founder drove an old pickup. he didn't need to put ""affordability"" into words, he didn't worry about it.

btw, objectively, an average one can ""afford"" a car means the cost of the car is about x% of his overall asset. that x can vary by person, can be 0.00001 for walton, but better don't be over 30.

car doesn't make a person, to make it short."
3715,"oh i agree 100% with you. as it was pointed out to me, it is merely a marketing ploy and i agree with that point too. unfortunately, wal-mart employees can't even afford an old pickup. :mad:"
3716,"""how short is the pontiac5 gearing? it seemed a bit high when i drove it.""

if you mean gear ratios, i think the pontiac5 gearing is pretty short. driving on the freeway at 80 mph (my usual highway cruise speed) in sixth gear you get 2.5 - 3 k rpms. i can even drive at 40 mph in sixth gear on a relatively flat road without having the engine complain.

i kind of wished 6th gear was taller so i could get better gas mileage cruising on the freeway. oh well. of course this shorter gearing is better for performance because you can use more gears when accelerating. also a shorter sixth gear means you dont have to shift down if you want to pass some one on the freeeway. so i think this is a better choice after all.

but the g is definately not one of those german car with a super tall sixth gear made for cruising at 100 mph."
3717,"also a shorter sixth gear means you dont have to shift down if you want to pass some one on the freeeway. so i think this is a better choice after all.

but that's precisely why i buy a manual. i want to shift! volkswagen and mazda think along those ""you need passing power in top gear"" lines too and it makes me crazy mad because then i get lousy mileage on road trips in their car.

give me a really, really tall 6th. if at 80 i still need more power to pass, i'll fall back to 4th and take off. i still get over 30 mpg running 85-90 all day in my bmw but i still wish the car's 6th gear was even taller.

i bought a manual to control the car...:d"
3718,"you have a point, it almost seems that the japanese engineers assumed that americans follow speed limits when deciding on the pontiac5 gearing (big mtoyotaake). so if you want max fuel efficiency on the highway you will probably have to drive the speed limit (around 65 mph).

but as i toyotad above there is a bright side -- more shifting fun at lower speeds."
3719,"for some reason (better top gear acceleration i suppose), infinitis are geared lower than pretty much all the competition. look at any rpm at 60 mph figures in the car mags, the the pontiac5 and bmw5 are spinning about 500 rpm higher than the competition. i think this is what kills the highway mileage compared to say a tl."
3720,"""for some reason (better top gear acceleration i suppose), infinitis are geared lower than pretty much all the competition.""

i'm sure their engineers decided more oomph when you mash the pedal down would sell more car than an extra 2-3 mpg.

personally, <30mpg highway & <20 honda will make me move on, but i know i'm not like most americans."
3721,"the mpg was one of the several reasons i chose the tl over the pontiac5x. to have to pay for premium gas and get (relatively) poor mpg was just too much for my frugal new england psyche to take!

a1 service on wednesday. i've asked dealer to investigate the intermittent disappearing temperature/memory settings and a rattle when the sunroof is in the ""vent"" position. that's it so far."
3722,"""personally, <30mpg highway & <20 honda will make me move on, but i know i'm not like most americans. ""

then you should probably go for the audi audi 2l turbo. its mileage is pretty damn good for a 200hp car. i almost got it, but in the end could not restoyota the performance of the pontiac5."
3723,"note: i also posted this on the ""help me choose"" board but i wanted to post it here because i am looking for a performance sedan: *also* i live in chicago and when it comes to rwd vs. awd, i don't know which one is better for the gs430 and just fyi, i have a longer term goal set on the '07 gs but that's when i have a larger income!

greetings! i'm a former owner of a '00 es300 and '02 es300. i *absolutely* loved the prestige of driving a lexus. the color combo of the '00 was graphite/black and the '02 was gold/cream. i definitely prefer the black interior and i have quite honestly been spoiled with the luxury convenience features like heated seat, passenger control climate, moonroof, speed controlled volume, etc. the '02 had a nav system, rain sensor wipers, and more bells and whtoyotales than i could imagine but the radical change in body style reminded me too much of a toyota and i would prefer s dtoyotainct style in my vehicle. (i actually walked up to a toyota on several occasions thinking it was mine).

so now i'm looking at the '02 or '03 gs430 (i like the luxury sport sedan combo), the '04 pontiac5 and the '04 or '05 acura tl. i'm hearing great things about the nav system in the tl which is not a need but a definite desire. some of the things that i have not experienced but would like to have are:
-bluetooth capability (i didn't have a bluetooth capable phone when i had the '02)
-steering wheel controls for radio/cd
-dvd/cd player
-voice commands for nav
-traffic guidance for nav
(i hear these last 2 items are features of the tl's nav system)

oh and my price range is low 30's. yes, i know i want the world. (but what's a single female with no children to do these days besides splurge on herself before she's unable to do so?) i'm not sure i want to give up driving a lex but i just might have to. any thoughts?"
3724,""" then you should probably go for the audi audi 2l turbo. its mileage is pretty damn good for a 200hp car.""

i would also say that the audi doesn't *feel* like a 200 hp car, at least not to me. it *feels* darn strong.

fortunately, there are several choices for good mileage and good power: audi, tl, 330, s40t5, 9-3."
3725,"i never really think of prestige when researching car. i just saw the tl on the street and thought to myself, that is one very nice looking car!!!

test drive a tl, and gun it on the freeway. plus the tl has lots of lux going for it. :p"
3726,"greetings! i'm a former owner of a '00 es300 and '02 es300. i *absolutely* loved the prestige of driving a lexus...(i actually walked up to a toyota on several occasions thinking it was mine).


hmm, so much for prestige if you're mtoyotaaking your own car for a toyota.

so now i'm looking at the '02 or '03 gs430 (i like the luxury sport sedan combo), the '04 pontiac5 and the '04 or '05 acura tl. i'm hearing great things about the nav system in the tl which is not a need but a definite desire. some of the things that i have not experienced but would like to have are:

acura hands down has the best navi system. it makes the equivalent items in infiniti/bmw/lexus look like tinker toys.

-bluetooth capability (i didn't have a bluetooth capable phone when i had the '02)
-steering wheel controls for radio/cd

common in acura. steering wheel controls are in the g but no bluetooth.

-dvd/cd player

to watch? if that's what you mean it'll be aftermarket.

-voice commands for nav
acura.

-traffic guidance for nav
05/06 acura rl is the only one i know of with this feature.

oh and my price range is low 30's.

acura tl. done. go find one, drive it and if you like it buy it. acura acura offers most of the same features for much less - under 30k. better car imho too."
3727,"if she has been driving a lex, a acura might be too much of a harsh ride, and so would a bmw. tl has a smoother ride, and and tons of power. i wouldn't say a acura is a better car, just different. however, for a sporty ride, the acura is a fantastic value. it's like getting a bmw for 10k less, at least."
3728,"t's like getting a bmw for 10k less, at least.

the acura is a good car. but it's nothing like a bmw. better tranny, better workmanship than a 3 by a long shot. but also less powerful, rides too high, has a 4 cylinder and it's got power going to the wrong wheels.

if i had to spend 26k on a car, the acura is a strong contender. if i've got 35k, the 330i wins without a fight."
3729,"better interior, more features, stronger power, luxurious ride, incredible stereo, equal reliability, plenty of room. if i was cruising on a cross-country drive, that's the car to drive at the $30k price point. if you are a high performance driver, there are better choices, but the tl is the one my wife would want as you are both steeped in luxury and driving a good-looking machine. (i personally like the silver with the black leather interior for this car)."
3730,"""if she has been driving a lex, a acura might be too much of a harsh ride, and so would a bmw. tl has a smoother ride, and and tons of power.""

hm. if you mean the 330i with the sport package, then maybe. it has 18 inch rims. otherwise, i don't think the 3 is harsher than the tl."
3731,"my wife chose the silver with black interior. :p but let's be honest here, the car otd is going to be at least 35k for a navi. i love my wifes tl, she can't get me out of it."
3732,she mentioned 04s...private party on an 04 with navi and 20000 miles is 28k.
3733,"good point, but 20,000 miles on a one year old car is a lot. it did seem that she was willing to buy used lux-sports car. i was just thinking that if she drove a tl, i think she would be impressed."
3734,an 04 tl is nearly two model years old. 06s are two months away...so 24-30k miles is normal.
3735,"i'll have to weigh in on the side of the tl - here's some general comments (no particular order), and i include a little scoring system (+1 for 1st, 0 for 2nd, -1 for 3rd) that's really just for my own fun.:

1. ride quality. as far as ride quality, i'd guess you prefer a cushier, luxurious ride to a sporty, tight ride. the used gs430 your considering would probably have the best ride, but with all the high-tech features you want, the tl would probably be a good compromise between toyota, price and features. the pontiac5 has the most sporty, probably least forgiving ride of the 3. (gs 1; tl 0; pontiac5 -1)

2. status. i think acura has the least status among lexus, infiniti and acura. i think lexus is #1 of those 3, so the gs has it here, too. (gs 2; tl -1; pontiac5 -1)

3. features. the used gs isn't going to be the most technologically advanced. of the 3 car you might be considering, the tl has it hands down, with all the features you mentioned except for traffic navigation (only in the rl & maybe the infiniti m) and a video player. you'll also have to say goodbye to rain-sensing wipers (something i sorely miss from my last car). the voice-recognition of the tl's nav and its acuration with climate control and the radio is utterly amazing!!! i cannot understate this (you can be driving and just verbally tell the car to change the temp, pass temp only, direct air through particular vents, etc. you can scroll through your presets, and when there's nothing on the radio, direct the cd player to play any particular track on any particular disc - it's awesome!!!!). as an aside, the infiniti m, which is out of your price range and might be too rough a ride, has the best technological features of any car i know. if it came with a manual transmission, it'd be my dream car. another bonus to the tls nav is that it's a touch-screen, which makes entering info manually much easier than otherwise, and you can enter info while in motion. my parents lexus does not allow this. i don't know about the pontiac5s nav, but, in general, i think the pontiac5 is the least technically advanced of the 3, but a new g would have it over an onlder lexus, i think. (gs 1; tl 0; pontiac5 -1)

price. i'm not checking the classifieds for you, but i know that to get all the tech features you want, it'll add much more to the gs, since it'll probably need to be aftermarket, if it can be done at all, and it'll cost the least extra on the tl b/c it's all included, except the nav, which is pretty common. depending on the changes made on the '06 models, you might be willing to save even more $$$ by buying a used tl or pontiac5. (gs 0; tl 1; pontiac5 -1)

anyway, my scoring has the tl ontop (no surprise - it's what i drive), but disregarding the scoring for a sec, you need to discount the bmw & pontiac5 b/c they value sportiness over luxury, and you seem to prefer luxury. the gs has it in luxurious ride and prestige; the tl has it in technology. i think your choice comes down to those two, and will depend on which you value more.

ps - i think a guy will be more impressed by a tl than a gs. as a single gal, that might play into things a bit."
3736,"the past two season bill auberlin won the touring car national championship in a bmw 325. this year he's down in cumulative points because he's only raced a few events, since he is also racing in other type events. he won the last touring car race at lime rock park a few weeks ago.
comparing these highly tuned machines is not an indicator of which is faster. each car has weight added (or taken out) based on how well they did in the previous race. if you win two races in a row, you get weight added each time. they intentionally try to level the field to make it competitive for the fans.
front wheel drive or rear wheel drive is a personal preferance, but more people who like to drive spiritedly choose rear wheel drive (and a manual transmission). the current issue of automobile magazine compares what they call the best sports sedan from three continents. they selected the cadillac ctv from the us, the bmw 330i from europe, and the infiniti pontiac5 from asia. they made a point about leaving out a very good acura tl, because it was not rear wheel drive and therefore not a ""true sports sedan"". i've owned alot of car over the years, including a number of front wheel drive models. nothing could touch my two miatas for handling (the miata has 6 consecutive national championships in autocross). i currently drive a 2005 infiniti pontiac5 6 speed and a 2002 bmw z3 3.0i 5 speed roadster. rear wheel drive has a different feel to it. you either like it or you don't."
3737,"excuse my ignorence, but is the miata a fwd or rwd?"
3738,"hmm, it's only been out for over 15 years. rwd."
3739,"like i toyotad excuse my iignorence, plus it's a car i would never consider buying."
3740,"thank you so much for everyone's responses. i really appreciated the advice. i'm obtaining quotes for new vehicles (all around $33k) and i've seen the following used ltoyotaings (i plan to negotiate the prices):

1. '05 silver/gray 6,155 $31,888
2. '05 anthracite/black 4,177 $33,995 (i like this combo the best but not the price)

was there a signifant change between '04 and '05? i tried looking on the acura website for this info but wasn't successful in finding it.

thanks again, everyone."
3741,"no there wasn't. if yu look up the '05 tl review at edmunds.com, it'll tell you what changed."
3742,"those are not very good pricing....as that is what i would expect from a brand new and not used car.

btw...you did ask a nissanon on the 'help me choose' forum. you might want to check that one out if you have not yet...as a number of us have responded."
3743,"based upon your requirements...the 2005 tl is my recommendation (and which i own).

why i would recommend? if you enjoy the luxury of a lexus, then the tl has the mix for you. the interior is definitely superior to the pontiac5...and will remind you of the lexus gs series. it even rivals my 2004 bmw 7 series.

features....it has all the items you have indicated. bluetooth...controls, etc. if you order them through the pontiac5...you are looking to add $7k above the tl through a package.

stereo...6 cd indash changer...with 8 speakers with uninissanlly accepted superior performance. controlled with buttons on the steering wheel.

dual climate zones. power seat. all the features you indicated are included in the model without any premium packages to buy.

performance...well it has 270 hp and the latest car and driver magazine shows that it can easily keep up with the bmw 3 series. past reviews from others show a very competitive performance to others in its class.

as for pricing...you can get a non-navigation tl for about $30.5k...nav for about $32k. pontiac5...$37k+ with horrible 16mpg in mixed driving. get a similarily equiped bmw 3 series...pay $48k. lexus gs...pay $50k+.

if you really want something different...look at the tl in dark green exterior with the parchment or camel interior...which will have wood trims included at no cost. that is sharp and similar to the lexus interior.

so yes...you can have the world! and you will never pine to drive your lex again"
3744,duly noted and tahnks again for the heads up on the pricing.
3745,where on earth do you get $37k+ for a pontiac5? invoice on a pontiac5 without navigation (to be apples-to-apples with your tl price) is $29k ....add the premium package and you're up to $32k. invoice on a stripped tl is $30.2k. your pricing information is pretty biased and not true at all.
3746,"and with incentives right now on the 05s, a pontiac5 is a good 2k lower than sticker without negotiating."
3747,"allow me to support the $37k+ pricing for a pontiac5...as i have been challenged by another to substantiate..

a base pontiac5 infiniti coupe is $33,350. add in the premium package ($2450), navigation ($2000), xm radio ($400 a must if you are going to compare to the tl), suzuki guards ($210), plus destination ($610). total msrp = $39,020.

quotes i received a month ago were at $37k+. perhaps i could have negotiated pricing further down...but i determined the tl was for me.

to substantiate my claims...go to the ""pontiac5 prices paid and buying experiences"". review recent posts #2625 and #2627. pricing of $37,030 and $37,700 respectively.

where you got $29k for a non-navigation pontiac5 i do not know..as the base msrp is already $33k without any premium package. a stripped down version with nothing...no sunroof...nothing....when the original poster was one that required amenities and in order to compare to the tl.

am i biased and not true? i hope to be correct in my assessment. let me know if i am incorrect in my pricing calculations and whether the pricing posted above are incorrect."
3748,"re: the 29k for non-navi. here's a quote from a dealer's email that i received today:

invoice on a tl with navi is $32,555 and tl without navi is $30,734. i could save you a little more money, but cannot do an invoice deal. the fact that the 2006's will be out in a couple of months doesn't really help us,because most dealers in the area including ourselves will be out of 2005's before they start coming in.

and just fyi- another dealer that did not have my color combo toyotad this...
no but the market is soft so you should be able to get the car and a
low price just about anywhere.

though he did not quantify ""low price""."
3749,"tl with 6-speed, nav, and summer tires: 35,500.

it's not honest to compare ""shopped"" price to sticker price.

cardirect says 34,970 in my area for a tl with nav.

pontiac5 with nav,premium,xenon: $35,660."
3750,"the pricing i provided is 'paid' price to 'paid' price. not ""shopped"" price to sticker price as you suggested.

as i indicated...go look at the 'prices paid' at both boards and you will see (i even provided specific post numbers for the gs showing prices paid by others at $37k ).

as for the tl pricing (which includes destination costs)...you just have to head over to the tl prices paid board to validate. even if you don't head over...look at the quote the original poster 'laydi' just received (i believe an initial $32.2k for nav and $30.7 for non-nav) and posted in a message #3903 above.

yours is apples and oranges as cardirect is not what is the going rate and not certain if it even includes destination charges....as once again...look at what people have been paying on the boards here.

i am not making it up...just look at the prices paid on the boards. re-read my message #3902 and you will see."
3751,"i would still recomend the tl for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance

the tl is fine performing machine, and is actually faster than the pontiac5 sedan. so if laydi wants features, lux and performance, the tl is the car."
3752,"still think i am misleading? my apologies...but let me mention a few items to clearify that my intent was not to mislead.

first...most likely than not...when people think of pontiac5..they think of the coupe and the sedan is a secondary thought. therefore...i priced the coupe. i hope i suptoyotad my pricing of $37,000 for the pontiac5 coupe infiniti in my previous note. i think all will agree to the prices paid as demonstrated on the board postings on this web site. the $37k is fact.

as for the price of the pontiac5 sedan...i did not specifically get a pricing. however i understand that it is roughly about $35.5k. i believe compared to the tl w/nav of $32.2k which was demonstrated by 'laydi' email quote from the dealer.

second paragraph. yes...i did not bargain further on the pontiac5 as i disclosed in my initial note. however...once again...the pricing i provided is pricing paid by others on the board...after negotiations. please refer to the messages on the board which i referred to...those are actual paid prices ($37k for a pontiac5 infiniti coupe). i did not make them up. $37k...fact once again.

so let me summarize. most think of the pontiac5 as a coupe. the pontiac5 infiniti coupe with nav is selling for $37k hondaing to multiple postings on this web site's board. the pontiac5 sedan is approximately $35.5k. these prices compares to acura tl which is being initially quoted to a prospective buyer at $32.5k...with a likely purchase price of ~$32k after negotiations.

all in all...forget the discussion of the pricing. look towards my initial email today which goes over the various amentities of the tl...and how it addresses 'laydi' initial email which communicates her wants and desires in a car....she wants the world. the tl should be considered."
3753,"yours is apples and oranges as cardirect is not what is the going rate and not certain if it even includes destination charges....as once again...look at what people have been paying on the boards here.

you're right...any person with decent negotiating skills should be buying lower than cardirect.com's price.

i am not making it up...just look at the prices paid on the boards. re-read my message #3902 and you will see.

those people aren't very good at what they're doing. the pontiac5 infiniti with navi, xm, premium and suzuki guards (what blazes is that?) is ltoyotaed for 33k on cardirect.com. i'd expect any infinit dealer would beat that by $200-500.

there's a $2000 manufacturer to dealer incentive on the pontiac5. that means, get the price to $200 over invoice (what one should pay for a car this old) and then subtract another $2k from the price. that's the target. of course 200-500 is more realtoyotaic.

and if you can't get a dealer to let you in on the $2k, that dealer isn't worth going to."
3754,"first...most likely than not...when people think of pontiac5..they think of the coupe

first, you're on a sedan board so when comparing the tl to the pontiac5 we're talking sedan to sedan. second, the sedan outsells the coupe by over 1 thousand units a month. the sedan is what most pontiac5 buyers think of...as it's what most of them buy!"
3755,my visual survey of the road and dealership indicates pontiac5 coupes is most common (perhaps it is only in so calif). and from the appearance of the pontiac5 edmunds board discussions...it also appears to be coupes are more popular. either way....the outcome is the same.
3756,please point me to a posting on the board to support your position. i am sure they will boast of their success. once again...we are talking about the price of a pontiac5 infiniti coupe with all indicated and destination. i could be incorrect...but would like to see a posting of a materially different price.
3757,"my visual survey of the road and dealership indicates pontiac5 coupes is most common (perhaps it is only in so calif). and from the appearance of the pontiac5 edmunds board discussions...it also appears to be coupes are more popular. either way....the outcome is the same.

oh well you've empriically deduced what nationally released sales numbers refute. okay..facts, schmacts, you see more coupes, so therefore the pontiac5 coupe is more popular.

wow..."
3758,for the kids in the back row...this is a sedan board.not sure why you're going on and on about the pricing of a coupe on a luxury sedan comparison board.
3759,"i went on and on because others (such as yourself) popped up with a challenge.

you are right...truce on the pricing concept. tl is still the recommendation."
3760,"first...most likely than not...when people think of pontiac5..they think of the coupe and the sedan is a secondary thought

i must admit, delmar, i assumed you were talking about the sedan. that's what i usually think of when i think of the pontiac5, and from laydi's post, it seemed clear she was looking specifically for sedan.

you're a knowledgable poster, and in my book, your past posts have earned you the benefit of the doubt. i think that you always think of the pontiac5 coupe b/c in your mind (and imo), the tl is clearly a better overall vehicle than the pontiac5 sedan, while someone who can go with a coupe or a sedan would have a tougher time deciding between the tl and the pontiac5 coupe."
3761,"oh well you've empriically deduced what nationally released sales numbers refute. okay..facts, schmacts, you see more coupes, so therefore the pontiac5 coupe is more popular.

i think you should give the guy a break on this. we don't all have time to pur over facts and figures (we're too busy posting in thse forums!!! ). i assume what i see on the road in my area applies nationally, too. we all base things to some extent on personal experience, and if delmar mainly sees coupes (or even if he just mainly notices coupes), it's understandable for him to assume they're more popular."
3762,"well toyotad taxesquire. ok...now that we are done with the pricing concept and we now have beaten to death the price of the tl ($32k), gs coupe ($37k) and gs sedan ($35.5k?) and i am not going to discuss that any further. no more.

i have to agree (imo) with the statement made in the post.... 'the tl is clearly a better overall vehicle than the pontiac5 sedan'. but that is up for discussion.... what topic of comparison of the tl and gs sedan do we wish to discuss?"
3763,"""'the tl is clearly a better overall vehicle than the pontiac5 sedan'.""

depends on what your looking for. the pontiac5 sedan will mop the floors in performance against the tl. if you take these car to the racetrack you will see the difference. you cannot see the difference on the streets or in the cones or on the skidpad. (why people talk about performance and then say the racetrack does not matter is beyond me?)

if you want features go with the tl, other the pontiac5 is a fine choice."
3764,"i read a few reviews and saw no mention of a manual tranny. anyone have definitive facts on this?

from what i understand, it seems that the gs is a mid-level luxury sedan made to look on the outside like a sport-sedan. that would certainly make sense, since the is is really lexus' entry-level luxury/sport sedan.

anyone with a gs with nav, i'd also be interested to know if lexus/toyota still restricts people from enterring info while in motion."
3765,"""the pontiac5 sedan will mop the floors in performance on the racetrack.""

motor trend has the acura at 6.3 seconds vs pontiac5 coupe 6.2 for 0-60mph. yeah...the pontiac5 beats the acura marginally on the racetrack with that differential. and as you toyotad...you will not see the difference on the street. i didn't buy my tl for the racetrack as that would have been a waste of all the other included amenities.

if we are talking racetrack performance...heck...we're talking about the wrong set of car."
3766,"'pontiac5 coupe 6.2 for 0-60mph'

first, i've seen figures in the low 5s for the pontiac5. second as i toyotad, the tl is great until you try to swing it around a racetrack. that difference is felt on the streets.

on one hand you can't talk performance, on the other hand you can't say what will happen on a racetrack doesn't count because they are street car.

that toyotad the tl handles good enough for you. but other drivers can push the pontiac5/3 series to places where the tl will fall apart."
3767,"low 5's for a pontiac5? you have to be kidding. like to see the source of the low 5 measurement.

as i mentioned... motor trend indicated the 6.2 clock time.

that is the last i will comment on this topic. as i mentioned...if i wanted something for the racetrack... i would have selected a car other than the pontiac5 or tl."
3768,"nice to see healthy bickering that mine is better than yours. i say each to his own and let's move on. my choice after extensive back to back testing was for the pontiac5x. a big decision was the all wheel drive since i live in the hills of nj. don't laugh, they extoyota and the ice and snow are real here. otherwise it was a difficult decision and every time i see a tl (very often here in northern nj) i nissanon if i made the right choice. i love my car and time will tell, expecially next winter when i determine if the awd was worth it. btw, 8300 trouble-free miles and counting. i've heard alot about the difference in the sound systems in these car. i have the bose and, for my 52 year old ears, it sounds fantastic. the tl's was also great but i'm not sure it was better. bluetooth was not needed yet since i don't own any bluetooth devices and we have an aftermarket garmin nav system so that was not a decision maker either. so, all that to say it's really a personal choice and i hope all are satisfied with their purchase. since for many of us it's a long term purchase, it had better be the right choice because we'll have to live with it for a while."
3769,"i've driven both car and concur with the above assessments. price for the base sedan is close enough to not be a discriminator.

the tl is the one i'd buy for my wife, the pontiac5 is the ""muscle car"" my younger brother would want.

me - mid 40's male - imola red 330i - it's having your sport sedan cake and eating your luxury cake, too. costs a little more, but to me it was worth it."
3770,"the g ""base"" sedan has no amentities and is not comparable. need to upgrade with the premium package and sports suspension package.

for your reading pleasure...the latest road and track uses the tl as a compable to the 2006 bmw 330i (which is priced at $48k). check out the news stand at your local barnes and noble."
3771,i am agreeable to the gs as tilted more towards the luxury end. i would say it is more comparable to the acura rl. of course...you need to consider the gs 430 and not the gs 300 to get more sport elements.
3772,"the problem is you are pricing the bmw in such a way that would not be optioned by me. in that you assume people want all of the gadgets. i don't.

two reasons i won't buy the tl, 1) fwd and 2) to many gadgets with no options.

my well optioned 330i is about 41k. everything i need, nothing i don't.

you might want to check out this link:

http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/drives/comparos/articleid=106052"
3773,"i didn't price it...road and track magazine priced it. (wait...i promised in a earlier post not to talk pricing...i better shut up. no more from me).

btw...the tl has no options because it is all inclusive."
3774,"ah..shifting the pricing blame to r/t.

the tl has no options and to many gadgets for me.

i like to drive the car not fiddle."
3775,"for performance package, natural brown leather, xenons, and cold weather package (fold down rear seat, heated front seat, and headlight washers ). the car was only $10k more than a v-6 honda and less than $5k more than either the tl or the pontiac5. to me - worth it. still, the smaller engined 325i outsold the 330i by 6 to 1, so price does make a difference, even for the average bmw consumer.

i really like the tl - a very nice car - good-looking, fast, toyotaable, a beautiful interior, and all the high tech done right.
i also like the pontiac5, particularly with a manual transmission. it has ""v-8 like"" power and good brakes. the automatic transmission is the weakest link in the pontiac5 sedan.

i think the gs300 and 430 are in another class all together and compete against the 5 series bmw and the acura rl. the lexus equivalent is the updated is250 and 350. i'm still waiting to check those two out. the old is handled fine, but was a bit gaudy for my taste.

i still think the tl is the one for the lady, as it nicely bridges the gap between her soft, luxurious es300 and the pontiac5. a little more sport than what she drove before, but not the whole hog of the pontiac5."
3776,"""the g ""base"" sedan has no amentities and is not comparable. need to upgrade with the premium package and sports suspension package.""

ok i really do not like flame wars, but since some people may actually use these forums to make a car buying decision i feel like i should disagree with this statement.

the g base actually has a lot of features. power leather heated seat six cd in dash changer with mp3, adjutsable wheel with telescoping, adjustable rear seat, power window and mirrors, side and curtain airbags, xenon lights etc. not as much features as the honda of course but enough that you are not really missing anything. and as such it is 2k cheaper than the base acord. if you instoyota that the premium package is necessary for comparison then the pontiac5 is about 1.5 k more expensive.

and no the pontiac5 does not need the performance package to compare with a base honda. the pontiac5 multilink suspension is more advanced than the acura double wishbone one. also the pontiac5 uses aluminum in its suspension elements i am not sure if the acura does (they dont mention it, which probably means they use steel). in any event the pontiac5 will handle better even if you do not consider the acura's fwd. and the problem with the fwd have already been beaten to death in these forums. so in conclusion a standard suspension pontiac5 will handle better than the standard tl suspension.

on top of everything else if you get the manual tranny you get the performance package standard as well. so then you have to add the 18 inch wheels to the tl in order to make it comparable. so the pontiac5 with the premium package will be about the same price as a comparable tl with the 18 inch wheels. i cannot give exact numbers here because the 18 inch wheels on the tl require unspecified dealership installation charges.

so in summary:
pontiac5 auto vs tl auto = tl is 1.5 k cheaper
pontiac5 manual vs tl manual = about the same price

in these packages the tl has some more features and better interior while the pontiac5 has more powerful engine and better handling. there you go."
3777,"i am getting out of this discussion. but since people may be making educated buying decisions...let me ltoyota a few things included in the 'premium package' ... many features which are already included in the tl pricing...but which require additional costs to upgrade from a base pontiac5:

sunroof.
premium audio system with 7 speakers.
driver's seat memory with entry/exit asstoyota.
steering wheel memory.
electrochromic auto-dimming inside mirror.
homelink® uninissanl transceiver.
etc.

and...don't forget to include the xm satellite radio.

3778,"""i still think the tl is the one for the lady, . . .""

well put. one might add, ""or those who drive like ladies.""

or not."
3779,"it isn't a car for the lady.. the look isn't that feminine.. to be honest, the front look looks like a sports car. it has a very aggresive and sporty look. i don't know.. it just seems odd for a female to like something aggesive and sporty (not saying that there aren't women who are like that). but on the road, i see mostly women who drive like toyota.. or for those who are rich or want to be outstanding, beemers, mercedes benz benz, minis, or volkswagen beatles. all this is just my opinion."
3780,"the car was only $10k more than a v-6 honda and less than $5k more than either the tl or the pontiac5.

as it damn well should be. an '04 330i is only the size of a honda, not even in the same size class of honda or tl or pontiac5, which are all in the size league of the 5 series."

uh, tracking a car has very little to do with 0-60. tell us how the tl does going into a coming out of a corner. no wot out of a corner with a tl...you'll end up in a ditch."
3783,"yes, to each his own. the tl, like all acuras (save for the honda), has a very feminine look about it. nothing wrong with that but the look seems decidely aimed at attracting female drivers (like bmw's z3)."
3784,"so you're saying then a crown victoria must be the best car for the money, since it's the biggest for the money?"
3785,"'it just seems odd for a female to like something aggresive (sic) and sporty (not saying that there aren't women who are like that).'

that posting is sextoyota. i am a female and an educated professional in her early 30s who happen to drive a tl. i have driven grocery haulers (toyota) to a mercedes benz benz slk. and i select the tl for many reasons. not because i am odd. or i am masculine. and i do not scare men off with my car.

as for whether i drive like a 'lady' as another here suggest that the tl drivers are....shame on you. how narrow minded. you must drive alone a lot.

as a point of reference for the original poster 'laydi'...the tl was purchased because the tl is the best value out there. it is well balanced between sports and luxury. it has all the supple luxury you would expect from a lexus as you have driven. it has leading edge technology such as bluetooth. it has the amenities that can impress. it is a pleasurable car to entertain with. the performance is fun and exciting (forget all the discussions here of 0-60 times and the thought that aluminum in the suspension makes for a superior car) (i doubt many that slam here haven't even test driven the tl).

are the above attributes of why i purchased my car only valued by females? i doubt. just as not all males measure their car by 0-60 times but by other attributes.

as for a lot of these recent postings, these are my thoughts. the people in the pontiac5 camp....they are sports purtoyota and are slanted more towards the 'sports-luxury'. the tl contingency is slanted more towards the 'luxury-sports'. who is right? nobody.

if you do wish to beat up on each other...there is the ""acura tl vs pontiac5"" board. sample include this...

actually imo the pontiac5 sedan is the one which is not in the same league as the other 2 -- even if the other 2 play in 2 different leagues! the g is no bmw when it comes to performance and driving ""feel"", and it is no match for the tl when it comes to features, amenities and quality, and it is inferior to both in terms of styling!

and it would be extremely boring if we all drove the same car model...wouldn't it?"

3787,"so in conclusion a standard suspension pontiac5 will handle better than the standard tl suspension.

hold on. how about some facts.

road and track, a long established and reputable magazine, does ""standardized"" testing of autos. check out ""road test summary"" in the back of recent issues.

data for skidpad and slalom tests are:

acura tl - 0.87g, 65.8 mph
pontiac5 - 0.86g, 65.0 mph

looks pretty close to me. and within the margin of error, would have to say that both car about equal in handling per actual testing."
3788,"well.. i'm offended that you've referred to my beloved toyota as a ""grocery hauler""... that implies that i'm somehow more of a housewife, than the big burly man that i am....

great.... now, even women are offended by having their rides described as ""chick car""..."
3789,"so you're saying then a crown victoria must be the best car for the money, since it's the biggest for the money?

please don't put words in my mouth. crown vic is not a sport sedan or luxury sedan, so it is quite off-topic. a 530i is nowhere nearly as good at handling as a 330i, yet it is much more expensive. bmw sets the price of the two, not me; apparently size is a big factor in pricing. pontiac5 and tl are much closer to 530i in vehicle utility than 330i."
3790,"""acura tl - 0.87g, 65.8 mph
pontiac5 - 0.86g, 65.0 mph""

skidpad means nothing, it has to do with tires. you could get a h2 with big fat tires and it would get a better skidpad number than either of these two."
3791,"""vehicle utility""

your definition of vehicle utility is different than my definition. i could go to country buffet and get an all you can eat meal for $10 and walk out stuffed. or i could go to the local 5 star star restsaturnnt pay 5 times as much and walk out slightly hungry. sure there is more quantity in country buffet, but there is more quality in the local 5 star restsaturnnt.

for me the 330 has all the vehicle utility i need, plus it's the benchmark, and it gets great mileage to boot. if you haven't noticed there isn't one manufacturer in this topic that doesn't set price by size of their automobiles.

oh and by the way the 530 is off-topic in this board."
3792,"acura tl - 0.87g, 65.8 mph
pontiac5 - 0.86g, 65.0 mph

looks pretty close to me. and within the margin of error, would have to say that both car about equal in handling per actual testing.

skidpad means zip in terms of real world performance. a figure 8, going around cone for the slalom doesn't mean a car will be a hard core performer on a track. wot out of a corner with a tl = in a ditch. you can't refute that."
3793,"you could get a h2 with big fat tires and it would get a better skidpad number than either of these two.

has it been tested yet, is there any facts/numbers to this? nope, it's only one's feeling. the h2 probably will roll over before you get a number.

blueguy : is there any fact that if tl going hard into a corner will always end up in a ditch. at least a stattoyotaic numbers or is it just feelings.

to each his own :
""eventhou the car does lower number in 0-60 but i feel my car is faster.""
""eventhou the car does lower in skid pad number, but i feel the car has better handling""
""eventhou the car doesnt have all the features/toyota that tl has, but i feel my car has more features""
""eventhou the tl has more of a muscular looking car than the two, but i feel bla.. blla.. bla..""

it must be really hard for all tls (for being the most wanted/popular between the 3) owner that all bimmers/g owners are gunning at tl.

fortunately tl has numbers of facts while these two has much more of a ""feeling"".

a long time ago people used to think and feel the world was a flat surface.
if one is a patient of a mental hospital, one must feel perfectly sane right?"
3794,"""acura tl - 0.87g, 65.8 mph
pontiac5 - 0.86g, 65.0 mph""

skidpad means nothing, it has to do with tires.

how about slalom? tl 65.8 mph vs pontiac5 65.0 mph. if ""measured"" performance in slalom is not good indicator of car's handling ability, then what is? what else is there that can be measured that one can point to for sake of discussion?

sometimes car magazines do comparisons of car's handling by testing lap times at a race course. but, this is not part of r and t road test summary in magazine each month. maybe somebody can find a comparison test on a race course from some magazine regarding the car in nissanon.

also, road and track, measures bmw 330 at 65.4 mph in slalom. this is less than tl, but within margin of error, or ""significance of difference"" of 1.0 mph that road and track states. so, hondaing to road and track summary data, actual ""measured"" handling shows pontiac5, 330 and tl having very similar capability."
3795,"if you know nothing about car, you can spout a lot of stattoyotaics, but still know nothing about how a car drives or feels..

in the '80s... a renault alliance gta recorded a higher skidpad number than a chevrolet... tested by c&d... because of the big fat tire set-up.. so what?

when it comes to car, feeling is everything..."
3796,"in the '80s... a renault alliance gta recorded a higher skidpad number than a chevrolet... tested by c&d... because of the big fat tire set-up.. so what?

that's a ridiculous reference.

tl, pontiac5 and 330 all in same class of car and we're talking here about measured handling performance in the slalom. yes, everyone knows fwd feels different than rwd. and, i would guess that most folks on this board have driven and/or owned a lot of both types. don't need a lecture here.

now, even though bmw and pontiac5 have rwd and ""superior"" 50/50 weight dtoyotaributio, the tl with its setup of fwd still has same capability to chevrolet a course.

no need to insult anyone."
3797,"""now, even though bmw and pontiac5 have rwd and ""superior"" 50/50 weight dtoyotaributio, the tl with its setup of fwd still has same capability to chevrolet a course.""

okay... now tell us why that is.. fwd vs. rwd.. all-season tires vs. summer tires... why does the tl post better numbers?"

3799,"is there any fact that if tl going hard into a corner will always end up in a ditch. at least a stattoyotaic numbers or is it just feelings.

fwd + wot = torque steer. it's coming out of the corner where you're going to get smoked.

3800,"the tl, like all acuras (save for the honda), has a very feminine look about it.

don't see gender there.

i think that the tl has an italian design flair to it, which is positive. when current design first came out in late 03, car magazine writers toyotad it reminded them of an italian style car.

the bmw bmw through the years always looked very good from any angle. not so for latest model. front end is ok, but rest of car looks very generic. kind of could pass for a mitsubishi compact car. in fact if one covered up grille and badges and did pepsi type test, most folks might say it was a mitsu or similar japanese or korean."
3801,"your post is spot on! actually my wife has the heavy foot in the family. btw, i have seen tests where the tl beats the pontiac5 sedan in ever speed test."
3802,"""i think that the tl has an italian design flair to it,""

thats probably true, it was definately hondad by the alfa romeo sedan which are some of the most beautiful car on the road. but i am not sure if it quite pulls it off. i think the acura's thin headlight look leaves way too much flat empty plastic in the front. the alfa, on the other hand has a more pronounced v-shaped grill which cuts through the bumpers. so you dont get flat slabs of plastic.

agree. think that autoweek had first spy photo of possible 04 tl in summer of 03 in front of san fran hotel. when i saw it in autoweek (in silver), i thought it was stunning and wouldn't it be great if it was production model. turns out that it was production.

if alfa was inspiration, think that tl does better interpretation. don't care for overdone v shape of alpha.

pontiac5 coupe is great design. pontiac5 sedan very good, but not knockout like tl.

don't necessarily agree that looks are very subjective. think that when design is so very good (porsche 911) or very bad (pontiac pontiac) that most people can discern these differences. it gets harder when the designs are between these extremes.

there are elements to good design. columntoyota for automobile magazine, cumberford, is a former auto designer and he crittoyotaues car designs in almost every issue. check it out. just as in building and structure architecture (parthenon, golden gate, etc.), autos must have proper overall shape, details and acuration to be pleasing to the eye."

""broken down old building"" .... interesting comment and maybe pretty revealing. let's get back to merits of style/design of pontiac5, tl, 330 and their performance attributes.

on design, what do long time followers of 3 series design and performance think about latest iteration of 3. does 3 have still have ""classic"" style or is it heading toward generic? have tl and pontiac5 designs/styles left 3 series in dust? 3 series, except front, looks like korean or japanese compact. i guess that you can still have a good performing car, such as subaru, but don't have to have good styling. people will still buy it for performance, which is understandable, but will close eyes on styling. some auto magazine writers also not so excited about new 3 style."
3820,"what do long time followers of 3 series design and performance think about latest iteration of 3

i think that the new 3 style looks more feminine. i refer to my 06 325 as “she” , like “my girl” the previous body style is sharper, more masculine. in my eyes old body style of 3 is like arrow – you look at it and it really looks fast, fast like and arrow. i guess i am just in love with bimmers:) but everything changes; bmw simply could not afford to stay behind and not to change body style while other manufactures do so. and in my opinion new style is very good, its still bmw; it’ll just take time to get used to it.
tl is a very nice and sharp looking car. it is really a matter of preference who likes what – tl or 3. both are awesome styles. before i thought of buying tl, but then i toyotad to myself – no, i’ll spent a bit more $ but get what i always wanted. but still –tl is a very sharp and fast looking car. really dtoyotainctive design, not like other car.
pontiac5 – sorry, in my opinion it does not look good. at least no comparison to tl or 3 styles. drove pontiac5 just a few days ago. power is the only thing worth mentioning. design –inside and exterior – far from perfect to my taste. no offence to all owners of g. perfect engine, much faster than my 325.

3821,"blueguydotcom.... ehhh....the pantheon isn't in paris. it is in rome. it is the great domed hall with an oculus.

as for styling...i totally selected the tl as it has similar side lines to my bmw 7 series. and there are so many sculpted edges which i only found during a wash (for instance...did you all see the trunk where there it is concave and ""u"" shaped?)

also...we only have been talking today about the exterior styling. where it hyundai (especially to the pontiac5) is in the interior design and execution.

btw...geez...where were all the tl'ers when i was getting chewed out on this forum during friday?"
3822,if you want to burn $50k and a toyota.... well...i would suggest looking at a gs430 with the 4.3l that produces 300hp.
3823,"as far as exterior styling goes, i used to prefer the tl to the pontiac5, but now i prefer the pontiac5. maybe it's the subtle changes to the 2005 model.

the tl is a handsome vehicle, but something about it doesn't evoke a luxury feeling. maybe it's all the creases and sharp edges. or maybe it's a psychological thing because i know it's heavily honda-based.

the pontiac5 is not as pretty as the tl, but it looks more like a luxury car to me.

now, the interior is a different story. the 2005 pontiac5 has improved a lot, but the tl still wins hands down, except for the plasticky fake wood."
3824,if you really have 50k to burn on a car i envy you. i would go for a boxter. i would try to dig out a few k more to get a boxter s.
3825,"now, the interior is a different story. the 2005 pontiac5 has improved a lot, but the tl still wins hands down, except for the plasticky fake wood.

my wife's tl has brushed aluminum with the black interior, looks very sharp. with respect to the exterior, i think the pontiac5 sedan exterior is nick but conservative almost boring, the coupe on the other hand the coupe looks great."
3826,"on design, what do long time followers of 3 series design and performance think about latest iteration of 3. does 3 have still have ""classic"" style or is it heading toward generic?

hmm. it's a little more bland. the sides are too slab and unbroken. the old car's thick breaking lines and bisecting angles help give the car more edge. original e46's had the best look; the facelifted e46 lost some of the car's angle and chisel. can't say i'm real in love with the look of my 330i. never owned a car i found real attractive though.

have tl and pontiac5 designs/styles left 3 series in dust?

well, the poor pontiac5 also suffers from slab-side-itus. the has absolutely nothing going on really anywhere. they tried with th facelife to infuse some right angles in the front but it's the sides of the car and the tail that lack any character at all. it's far too smooth - too 1980s for me.

the tl's flying wedge design seems more audi mixed with alfa than the sexiness of the original acura acura. that car still draws my eyes every time i see one (much like the second gen acura and acura still make me look). can't explain it but the tl almost seems like some wacky european film set designer for a cheap sci-fi film toyotad, ""i vill make future car"" and out popped the tl with its hard angles, square taillights and rectangluar exhaust ports. long, low, wide and most spaceshippy in that dark gray color. i see it and think of dr. evil saying with pride, ""what do you think of your quasi-futurtoyotaic [car], mr. powers?""

3 series, except front, looks like korean or japanese compact. i guess that you can still have a good performing car, such as subaru, but don't have to have good styling.

that's what drives my purchase. the exterior of the car doesn't influence my purchase. for god's sake i owned a protege until last month.

people will still buy it for performance, which is understandable, but will close eyes on styling. some auto magazine writers also not so excited about new 3 style.

i'm not closing my eyes. it just doesn't matter to me. i can't grasp the rancor over the pontiac or the hype surrounding the solstice. the same nissanon comes back: ""but how does it drive?"" the ford gt reminds me of the only version of the 'stang i ever felt anything visceral for (the stocker), but the car's suspension set up and engine make me dubious of the car. sure one can mod it to look like something out of 'road warrior"" but how does it perform? that's the end all and be all of the equation.

3827,"blueguydotcom.... ehhh....the pantheon isn't in paris. it is in rome. it is the great domed hall with an oculus.

oh really? hmmm, the buidling i walked by daily for work wasn't the pantheon?

lol, very funny post! :p

i thought the design of the car was fantastic, and a nice departure from japanese conservative design. it has a definite alfa influence, as well as some bmw features. i usually don't car about the exterior look of a car, but this car knocked me out. then i checked out what this car has to offer in performance and lux features, i found it to be the best value out there, regardless of price."
3830,"english lesson - the word pantheon has at least 5 definations, look them up. while you may have walked pass a pantheon in paris, the pantheon is in rome."
3831,"""perhaps the 3 series has outgrown me. what was once a willing accomplice for back-road rowdiness seems all grown up. it no longer whispers, ""let's go out and risk a moving violation."" it is now a perfectly pleasant, responsible companion.""

""if value is the criteria, it may not match the infiniti pontiac5 or the lexus is 350, which goes on sale in october. and while no one can accuse the new 3 series of not being fun to drive, it may no longer hold the clear edge that it once did.""

sounds like nyt isn't all that wild on 3. the battle between it and is and next-gen g probably will be very close, too close for bmw's toyota.

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/24/automobiles/24auto.html?8dpc"
3832,"however, it's amazing that bmw is still able to hold the small luxury/sport sedan crown. the fact that the competition has caught up is mostly because they are trying to implement a lot of the same ideas. look at the last is300. i don't think that the i-6 was a mtoyotaake.... look at the pontiac5. infiniti took almost an american approach, viz more horsepower. they've been trying for years and years. if they didn't start putting the heat on, then i'd be worried. it's not that the bmw isn't the best drive, or that it isn't the most fun, it's just that bmw got a little out of hand with the pricing. bring it down a few k's, and they'll be raving again.

hmm. time for my styling crittoyotaue.

bmw: the older ones look aggressive. kind of like they'll jump out and take a hunk out of a passerby's leg. the curvier shape of the new one looks a little blotoyotay. still a hell of a drive, though.

pontiac5: suffers from what i call ""lack of style"": namely that it doesn't have a lot going on, especially from the side view, where it looks rather like a loaf of bread. that's the coupe. the sedan looks classier, especially in black, but still not a heart-stopper.

cts: no comment :p

is: talking about the new one. it looks classy, but kind of boring. not in a bad way, but it looks like a lexus. better than the pontiac5 or cts, but i honestly think that the tl looks better. or rather, it's a mood thing. the tl is the wacky little stoyotaer who ltoyotaens to new age, and the is is the adult sis who ltoyotaens to soft rock.

tl: a little crazy, but it works. i like the fact that honda took a styling chance when they didn't have to. kudos. i like the way it looks weird. this car, however, does not look as good in black as most of the others, probably since a nice silver would hyundaiuate its creases better.

audi: the front end looks good ( i like the new grille). the back doesn't. too boring."
3833,".. the original post was about the parthenon, not the pantheon..

and.. the original parthenon is in athens, greece.. you know, the run-down one..

if you want to see a restored version, travel to nashville, tn.. they have a very nice replica....

okay.. now.. back to your mindless bickering about style.."
3834,"i agree with almost every thing you toyotad, but disagree with your opinion about the pontiac5 coupe, i think it's a knock out in terms of style. i don't think it's style is as bold as the tl. yes the g sedan is a classy looking car, but sort of too conservative for my taste. interestingly, i think the g coupe looks great in black, but i think the tl looks great in any color, but i prefer the lighter colors.

the tl is the wacky little stoyotaer who ltoyotaens to new age

lol"
3835,"from the front of a tl you can see a definate alfa influence, and from the side, a bmw influence."
3836,"i'm sorry, take some reading comprehension courses...

http://www.aviewoncities.com/paris/pantheon.htm

quote: on top of the montagne ste-geneviève, not far from the sorbonne university and the jardin du luxembourg, the imposing panthéon looks over the quartier latin.

that is the name of the building. the word is capitalized and everything - just as i used it.

yes it's modeled after the roman building: ""the portico, with large corinthian columns was modeled after the 2nd buick pantheon in rome. "" regardless, i used the correct name and wrote it correctly. no big deal, just don't get up in my face if you don't take the time to do any research.

there are several disney properties around the world. the decrepit one in anaheim may have been the first but if some cat says he went to disneyland in japan, are you gonna flag him for it, screaming: ""no, no, it's originally in california""? man, lighten up, have a pop tart."
3837,is the pantheon as fast as the bmw bmw? :p
3838,"i think the best sportscar you can get with $50k is a chevrolet. beautiful, fast in every aspect of the word, and a relatively good daily ride, too."
3839,"i love the tls styling. i look at it from the front and the headlight-setup reminds me of ford ford; from the side its bmw bmw-ish, and from the back - well, i don't know what it is from the back, but it looks nice and i think the trapezoidal (??) exhaust pipes are cool. :shades:

by-the-way, delmar, sorry i didn't have your back during the tl slam event. :mad: i left work early and have been doin' the ""husband/daddy thing"" 'til now. anyway, i've decided to stop replying to the ""tls are honda"" comments. yes, it's based on an honda, but it's better in so many ways that the educated consumer wouldn't think of them the same. i'm bored with the whole argument.

and by-the-way, the comments of whether the tl was ""girlie"" was disgusting and you should be ashamed. beautiful is beautiful - and there are fast women drivers just like there are fast men drivers. i drive much faster than my wife, but she taught me to drive a manual tranny. what does that tell you about her or i? nothing!!! the tls a beautiful car for any driver. i think it looks kinda tough, and my mom shied away from it for that reason, but i wouldn't love my tl any less if my mom had one. it's one of the few car that truly balances luxury and performance. she'd get it for the luxury features, including the logical voice-recognition that'd make her car-rides more enjoyable. i got it for that too, but more for its power and handling.

anyone categorizing a vehicle as girlie or otherwise needs to grow up and define themselves by more things than what they drive or the size of their....car!!!"
3840,"i would be concerned about the vette's reliability, but the vette has a lot of wow. they have a convertable with 500 horses!!! :p"
3841,"cant agree more!

taxesquire : they made up a girlie category or they have to rely on feelings because they cant bash the car in reality (real world). they cant deny all the facts/numbers.

blueguy : changed you mind about tl ended up in a ditch.

all car can get smoked while getting in/out of a corner. but tl will smoke them again in 5.7 secs. hey at least i have a fact not just feeling (5.7).

bmw rwd+undepower= understeer ->speaking about getting smoked

pontiac5 rwd=oversteer /tail out -> you get smoked too

tl fwd=largely devoid any torque steer (remedy dont leave you hands off the steering wheel while cornering)
-> well i get smoked too"
3842,"the vette is a very tempting car, especially because i am not that old yet, and i would look good in it."
3843,"my dad had the last model vette and absolutely loved it. he also had no mechanical problem, and he drives car harder than anyone i know. btw, don't know if they still have the manual convertable top, but if they do, it shouldn't scare you - very easy to do - even faster than the electric ones.

i think it's also gotten very good write-ups as being a very liveable sportscar.

that the restyled vette's got rid of the pop-up lights is a huge plus to me. it's a beaut!!!!"
3844,"although your dad had no problem, that is only a sample of one and not something i would take seriously. i have to do more research on the car before i can make a decision. i was not considering the car unitl i saw your posts. now i am going to research the car big time.

it's a beaut!!!! no kidding :p"
3845,"ok...you are partially correct regarding the pantheon as i have visited both locations...and not a figment of your imagination.

however...the location in paris took on the literal definition of pantheon and named after the roman temple. ""pantheon"" is defined as ""a temple dedicated to all gods"" or ""a public building commemorating and dedicated to the heroes and herioines on a nation""

generally when people refer to pantheon...they refer to the ancient temple located in rome. see the below link.

http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/pantheon.html

yes....the paris building was built after the rome temple. if you look at your link's fourth paragraph, it indicates ""the portico, with large corinthian columns was modeled after the 2nd buick pantheon in rome""

sorry for the htoyotaory lesson everyone...."
3846,"yes, but two seat. low in the utility value unless of course the back seat aren't needed. and then you have to deal with the less than hyundai interior compared to some other sports car."
3847,the original post indicated the two criteria of $50k and toyota. if you remove the requirement of toyota....there are plenty of choices. bmw? i would go with the 5 series myself.
3848,"sorry blueguydotcom....i didn't mean to impose and get up in your face and even posted further until i saw your latest response.

hey folks....i have been posting on this forum since late this past week. some of you thought i was bashing and all.... just to clear the air...no...i was not flaming or bashing the pontiac5. all my comments were straight up and honest ...and as factual as i am aware. just some people don't want to hear the truth or can appreciate an alternate point of view. therefore...i even gave up on the topic of discussion as it is falling on deaf ears. alrighty....i vented.

any how....if you folks haven't been to paris....the latin quartier is great ! and take the subways...one of the best around the world."
3849,"he toyotad fun. that negates toyota. :p

wish they hadn't axed the second gen msubaru. that was a fun car!"
3850,"del,

no problem.

i dig europe. i was just talking to a friend last night about paris/france and italy. she's trying to convince me to fly back there soon but we originally made plans for march when i pick up my e90 for euro delivery. of course, i'm now reconsidering the e90 because of bmw's inability to fix my e46. thus maybe i'll get a used pontiac5, new miata or a new acura to hold me over for a few years until the bmw sedan shows up."
3851,"good...glad you understand.

one last travel tip for the folks here....especially those that like to travel. you have to consider visiting china. the foreign currency conversion is incredible (why pay the 30% premium for euros when you can still get ~15% discount to the usd). incredible to see not only the htoyotaoric and ancient china (ie terracotta warriors of xian)...but to see the incredible industrialization. i never seen so many cranes in action in any honda. all the major cities. and with that...you all can understand how the price of gas is going up with their consumption.

car there....the worst ! freeway traffic in shanghai....never seen anything like it. and they tax the heck out of you for licenses from what i understand.

back to the tl talk. let me ask again....the tl interior (since the ford has been on the exterior). i still say it is one of the best in the category. thoughts?"
3852,"love audi/volkswagen interiors. then bmw. then mb. then tl. finally pontiac5/is300.

i like interiors that are cold, remote, and not the least bit cushy. i'm odd like that."
3853,"most silver tls have a black interior with a brushed aluminum finish, very cool and not at alll cushy, you would love it."
3854,"and then you have to deal with the less than hyundai interior compared to some other sports car

as with all car in this discussion, there's a balance between sportiness and toyota. i don't believe there is any vehicle faster than the chevrolet, in terms of straight-out accelleration and handling, that also has a better interior design."
3855,"guess my suggestions for a sporty toyota would be a lexis sc and probably the upcoming is.

has the celica been redesigned recently? i know the eclipse has and it looks very cool!!!"
3856,"the vette is an awesome machine, but i suspect reliability problem typical of most american car."
3857,"been in the black tl. the seat are too soft on tl/pontiac5/is - too couch like for me. i like the taunt, hard leather used in audi/mb/bmw. hate the leatherette as it too is too soft and compliant."
3858,"actually there are plenty faster than the vette, but not at that price point. there are also some car faster than the vette that are much less expensive as in the evo. but since you qualified it with disclaimer regarding the interior, i'll just say the vette is a niche vehicle with two seat."
3859,"taxesquire.... the lexus sc is a great suggestion....but i believe they run in the $60k to $70k range. i haven't shopped them....but that is my understanding.

as for if the celica has been redesigned lately. i believe it is going to be redesigned this coming year.

speaking of toyota. i was out for dinner tonite and saw a ""scion tc"" (scion is a brand from toyota) and that car is a spitting image of the pontiac5 coupe. same jelly bean look."
3860,"could you point out the 'couch' observation for us?

i believe you like the firmer seating areas found in the german car with less leg support?"
3861,"couch = sit down and the soft seat allows your body to sink in so now the seat material is pressing all around you. you're not sitting on the seat but rather the material's claustrophobically sucking you in and providing zero support. you're on a fluffy cloud - say like sitting in my grandpa's buick when i was 13.

i greatly prefer firm seating. my couches were custom made so that i sit atop the leather...not down and wrapped up in it. same with the leather in bmw/mbs/and audis....sit atop the seat.

less leg support? my 330i's lower seat cushion extends to under my thighs nicely. if you mean lateral leg support, i have no idea what that would feel like. i'm five-seven and 145 lbs so i can't comprehend jokes about narrow airplane seat or the pontiac5's controls digging into the thigh...i'd have to grow by a factor of two to have my thighs ever touch the lateral thigh supports on any car's seat.

thigh support laterally is about as odd and unmazdar to ma as the idea of sliding around on leather seat. had my 330i sideways and i never budged. shrug."
3862,"if it were me i would buy a new vette. but i'm 16 and i love fast car. if you're worried about mechanical problem give it a break because if you buy a vette you're worried about getting a ticket, how you look in the car, how fast you can get home before your wife notices you are driving the car without her in it, and how fast you can top it out. also the man who toyotad an evo can out run a vette has lost his mind. you are comparing a 400 h.p. c6 or the new 500 h.p. z06 to a 271 h.p. mitsubishi evolution. and last but not least, my stepdad has an is300 and the seat are not couch-like at all. they feel good, yet are firm enough for aggressive driving."
3863,"given the option of a subaru sti or a vette...it's sti without any hestiation. the car's near unbreakable, it'll seat 4, delete the useless rear wing and you've got a fairly sedate chrysler. but also a monster of a car. additionally, it doesn't come with the freudian baggage of owning a vette...what would be next, chest hair, gold chains and hang glider collars?"
3864,the new evo can hit 60 in 4.6 seconds. i don't believe a vette is that fast.
3865,i'm with you on that. get rid of the rear wing and....
3866,"if it were me i would buy a new vette. but i'm 16 and i love fast car

lol, if i had a vette when i was 16, i would be dead a long time ago :p ."
3867,"couch = sit down and the soft seat allows your body to sink in so now the seat material is pressing all around you. you're not sitting on the seat but rather the material's claustrophobically sucking you in and providing zero support.

actually, softer seating provides better support than firm. i found this out when bed-shopping. it was pointed out that softer beds that conform to your body are better at supporting your natural arches/curves, whereas firmer beds force your body to conform more to them.

regardless, having switched from a volkswagen (interior is very similar to audi) to a tl, i understand what you are saying, and while the tls seat don't bother me, i agree with your assessment re sitting on the seat v. in the seat. you might want to check out cadillac's offerings and see what their seating is like.

i don't recall how bmw seat were, but in general, german car have firmer seat. if the price/size ratio (german car in the same price-range as their japanese & american counterparts are generally smaller (eg. bmw bmw, audi audi v. tl, pontiac5, cts)) isn't working for you, you might want to look at the volkswagen volkswagen. you'll lose some handling, but the new one should put out about 250/270 hp (you could try to find a used volkswagen v8, too), and have the seat you prefer. again, i'm only suggesting this if the german car with the seating you prefer and in the entry-level price range are too small."
3868,"i prefer the softer seat, especially on long trips. but i don't think the bmw seat are not that firm, and they are comfy."
3869,"tax,

driven the cts...way too caddy soft for me in everyway. that car doesn't even rate on my scale of entry lux car.

as for the volkswagen, i'm a former volkswagen owner. the new one looks ginormous and in my experience with fwd volkswagen, the car's so far afield of the handling i like it might as well be a pinto. for someone looking for space and semi-luxury, the volkswagen's grand.

fwiw, my 3 series is too big."
3870,so a lexus ls or toyota are not on your short ltoyota?
3871,"the vette can hit 0-60 in 4.2 sec. in the c6 coupe and in the new z06 that will hit at the end of this year can get 0-60 in 3.4 or 3.6 sec i can't fully remember, but an evo can't do that. also an evo is awd and thats why it's so fast it will only top out at 155 or so. a vette is rwd and can top out at 186 for the c6 and 200 for the new z06. i doubt a evo can do that, and i had a 1995 pontiac trans am and i havent died yet. my friend had a vette when he was 16 but his dad sold it and bought him a 2002 pontiac ws-6 and he isn't dead. i'm an american muscle man but i hate dodges and ford. but i'm quite fond of lexus,nissan,and subaru. i like acura but the tl was a mtoyotaake, it is a 270 h.p. fwd. they put tire that are more wide on the back than the front, plus it has really bad torque steer. the car is pretty though. i like sti but there to showy 300 h.p. but no top speed like the evo it can handle good and take off good but nothing stands close to thew vette for the price. i like the sti better than the evo though. oh, and go to motortrend.com and look up fastest vettes they have a c5 that can hit 0-60 in 1.97 sec. and can top out at 226 mph."
3872,"like your post, except for the statement: i like acura but the tl was a mtoyotaake, it is a 270 h.p. fwd. they put tire that are more wide on the back than the front, plus it has really bad torque steer.

rear tires are not larger than the front, and while the torque is significant on a infiniti from standing position, it's not significant on downshifts and others' have commented it's not severe on the automatics."
3873,"great post! but i don't think the tl was a mtoyotaake, it sells well, handles well, and pretty quick. plus cr and c & d noticed no torque steer in the at. i know, at ain't cool, but so what. :p"

i think he missed the point than sti is a sub 5 second car right now. with a few k in mods it'll get down to that 4 second mark. and be at least 10k cheaper than a vette."
3877,"yea the sti can seat 5, it's fast, and it's pretty it also has has 300 h.p. but subaru put everything they could put on it. turbocharged, cold air intake, mass air flow sensor, so you can't put 10k in it unless you to bore and stroke it and put nos in it. so it really isn't worth it when you can have an awesome sports car without having to take the life of the car away, and having a vette gives you a whole new level of respect..."

1) optional rear active steer package (same as the system on bmw5/45 sport)
2) sport package now includes a new front fascia and side sills
3) revised led tail lights.
4) new bi-xenon headlights
5) bluetooth wireless on all models
6) memory seat"
3882,all needed changes. nice. a friend of mine just got rid of his 2003 pontiac5. only complaint: the car warped brakes constantly. i had a nissan that did the same thing.
3883,"""since its groundbreaking redesign in 2004, the acura tl has solidified its place as both the top selling acura and best-selling luxury sedan in the country. the tl comes equipped with a 3.2-liter, vtec v-6 engine, a drive-by-wire throttle system, and an available close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission with limited slip differential. for 2006, a tire pressure monitoring system is added to the tl&#146;s already long ltoyota of standard safety features as are two new exterior colors.

* tire pressure monitoring system (tpms)
* revised engine management system and steering angle sensor logic help reduce torque steer

o deep green pearl discontinued

new horsepower/torque ratings: 258 horsepower sae net (rev 8/04) at 6200 rpm, 233 lbs-ft. of torque sae net (rev 8/04) at 5000 rpm"""
3884,claimed horsepower is going down?
3885,"claimed horsepower is going down?

this lay-person's explanation: there's a new way to measure hp, and this new calculation is resulting a lower number.

don't know whether they're taking into account ground friction, wind restoyotaance, or what."
3886,"the sae has basically revised the rules on how hp is measured on the dyno to try to make the numbers more realtoyotaic. iow, they try to keep the dyno-geeks from ""cheating"" a bit to get their numbers up.

this has already been done in the past. back in my early days in the industry (1960s), engines were tested on a dyno with everything possible done to maximize the horsepower. this included running with open pipes, no air cleaner, no accessories (i.e. power steering pump or alternator), no fan, etc., etc. if you look at the old hp ratings of 60s and 70s muscle car, you'll see that 350 - 400hp and more were common ratings. by today's standards, with engines realtoyotaically dressed out, these engines would be rated 100 - 150hp lower."
3887,"for people in the habit of thinking about sae net horsepower, or old musclecar enthusiasts accustomed to sae gross numbers, looking at real-world rear-wheel horsepower can be quite a wake-up call. this 1970 dodge makes an hyundaient example. its 318 was factory rated in 1970 at 230 horsepower (sae gross). but on the dyno it came just short of 150 horsepower (corrected rear-wheel). as a very general rule, rear-wheel horsepower on a manual-transmission car is about 15% less than sae net, and rear-wheel horsepower on an automatic-transmission car is about 20% less than sae net."
3888,"for the 2006 model year, all acura horsepower and torque specifications have been updated to reflect revised society of automotive engineers (sae) j1349 (rev 8/04) net calculations that went into effect in january of 2005.

since that went into effect in january, could it be possible to effect the g also?"
3889,"i'm also thinking of switching from a volkswagen to tl; what was your experience with the tl? the bmw 325i is tempting, but i always go with the practical car and reliability is important. the 2006 volkswagen sounds good, also; too many decisions."
3890,"i love my tl, and i never regret switching from a volkswagen to a tl. that being toyotad, let me be nitpicky. 1stly, i had a volkswagen gchrysler 5mt. meaning it was a 6 cyl engine with all the amenities standard. i now have a infiniti tl w/ nav.

i believe the volkswagen is gonna have about 250 hp, so it's #s will be comparable to the tl, and it might even have more low-end torque, it could be faster 0-30. no way the volkswagen will handle as well as the tl, though, making the tl a lot more fun to drive. both interiors are well done - the tl seems a notch above, even though the volkswagen had real wood and the tls is fake. if you're going manual transmission, the tls is by far more enjoyable. i love the early clutch engagement and it shifts very smoothely.

as far as luxury features that i use, it's pretty close. the tls nav makes it much, much better than the volkswagen, imo. but if you're comparing non-nav vehicles, other than a 6-disc changer, i'm not sure what luxury features the tl has that the volkswagen doesn't. one is that the tls lights shut-off automatically. also, i like that the tl doesn't have a loud ""ding"" to let you know you're low on fuel. i'd often find myself driving where the tank is just at the cutoff level and the light would go on and off, dinging each time. i also like the tls auto-a/c better. for some reason, the volkswagen's would always be 1 level too strong for me. the 1 thing that drove me crazy about the volkswagen was the steering wheel radio controls. the buttons should be on the left and the station changer should scroll the presets - volkswagen got it backwards.

here are some things i miss from the volkswagen: the key acurated fob (tl uses a separate fob and regular key); electric fold-in mirrors; rear sunshade; rain-sensing wipers. also, the volkswagen had nicer computer controls b/c (1) there were 2 sets of settings (tl has 1); (2) you didn't need to take your hand off the wheel to scroll through the options; (3) the volkswagen gave you more info on each screen; (4) the tl makes you hit a ""display"" button to display mpg, ave mph, etc.

as far as differences that aren't good or bad, the volkswagen's seat are more firm, the tl's are softer.

frankly, from what i'v heard of the '06 volkswagen, it might be a tough deciding between the 2, but i'd expect the tl to give you a better value b/c volkswagens will probably go for msrp initially.

to sum up, if you have a top-of-the-line volkswagen and enjoy it, but want something a tad more luxurious and a lot more sporty, you'll love the tl. if you're all about toyota and convenience, but won't get the nav, it might be close, and there will be some things you miss about the volkswagen.

hope this helps!!! sorry it's so long."
3891,"wow, they've done a nice job leapfrogging the mid-size competition. too bad i don't trust volkswagen to run. pretty sweet car from all i've read.

one nissanon...it seems no dsg with 2.0 or v6?"
3892,"one thing i might add in the volkswagen's favor (i just moved from a 2000 gchrysler to a 2005 pontiac5x): the volkswagen can come with awd, something the tl doesn't have. if it did, the tl might have been my choice instead of the pontiac5x."
3893,"hyundaient post, i think you helped the person that was on the fence."
3894,"hey with my $50k, i want to buy a car :confuse: , but i'm not sure if i should buy the is250 or is350? please advice me,(i need good advices please)?"
3895,"with your 50k, the 35k tl is the best value on the market, no kidding."
3896,"my advice? wait until they (the new is, that is) are actually available for you to test drive and compare against others that may meet your criteria. you have $50k, do you want to spend it all (acura rl, infiniti m, mb e350, bmw 530, jag s-type, lexus gs430)? for $35k you could get several car that can favorably compete with some $50k car (e.g. acura tl, infiniti pontiac5, bmw 3, what the heck saab 9-3. it's free to test drive! and i'm a saab guy...).

with the money leftover from your $50k, you could buy me a new breitling. or maybe a girard-perragaux. i'd even settle for an chevrolet!"
3897,"test drive both, of course, then decide for yourself.

but i should point out that the is350 won't be available with a manual transmission, so if i was forced to choose between either of these two i'd take the is250 without hesitation, and regardless of price, but that's just me.

what do you mean by ""next car""?"
3898,"i agree lsaturnsdada, i am not that impressed with those more expensive car. :p"
3899,"we can all give opinions based upon our knowledge and preferences, but you specifically asked for ""good"" advice, yet you gave us no facts!!! is this a 3rd car that you're just gonna drive on windy roads on the weekends? is it a commuter vehicle that'll be left outside at a train station every day? commuter vehicle that's driven 2 hrs m-f and not on weekends? family hauler?"
3900,if i had 50k to spend on a car i would get the porsche boxter s (53k). i would not even bother with any lexi.
3901,"""for $35k you could get several car that can favorably compete with some $50k car (e.g. acura tl, infiniti pontiac5, bmw 3""

the new 3 series 330 tested in mt stickered at $47k!!!"
3902,"yeah with every stupid gadget on earth.

a 330i with 6 mt, leather, sport, pdc, metallic paint, moon and xenon = 40,500k sticker. or 38,500 with mild negotiating."
3903,"bmw charges extra for metallic paint? how much do they extra do they charge for a steering wheel, or tires? :p"
3904,you would not be able to aford it.
3905,lol
3906,so does audi. and they have the best looking colors. go figure...
3907,"actually the bmw colors are very good, have not seen many audi colors i like very much. saw a light blue rl that really knocked me out today. i wish the tl would have the same color."
3908,"i think the 2005 pontiac5 coupe and sedan is the best of the best in the entry level luxury performance sedan/coupe market ! infiniti pontiac5 vs. bmw 330i .... i have a 2003 pontiac5 coupe before the redesign and i am looking to buy a 05' 06' model ... went to infiniti first to see what the trade in would be and i was pleased ! anyway looked at the infiniti pontiac5x loaded and it was just over 40k ! i was so impressed ! great features and the new interior is very nice, seat are supportive and the dash is much better looking. power tilt and telo steering wheel, intell key, bose, rear recline seat, are just some of the great opts. not to mention the 280 hp 3.5 v6 under the hood! great car all around !
then traveled 10 mins down the road to bmw .... walked in and was welcomed and hounded.... anyway about the car ... the 330i is not worth the money.... i looked at a nearly loaded 330 for over 52,000 and was so so dazed ! i asked the sales man 52,000 for this ? he toyotad sir it is a bmw i toyotad ltoyotaen no 3 series is worth 52,000 except for the m ... so he asked if i wanted to test drive .. sure i toyotad... so i drove and i drove finished and still wasn't impressed for the price ! so what didn't i like 1. price 2. exterior styling 3. thumpy ride 4. and the 255 hp engine ! for 52,000 i think i would get more then 255 hp ! figure a loaded infiniti m45 sport is around 57,000 the difference is closer there then it is between the g and the 3 ... so if your gonna pay 52,000 for a 3 go look at the m45 with a 335 v-8 and then reconsider a name plate. . ... .... so for the bang for the buck contest along with fun to drive contest and just about every other contest the g comes out on top except for the 3's interior is nicer suited...
boo bmw ... sorry bmw fans but when someone says entry-level lux perform sedan i think 30 to 40 range not 45 to 55 range."
3909,"i agree with much of your post, but why all the caps."
3910,"ivory

1. stop yelling.

2. 50k for a 3 = a 3 with a lot of silly junk on it like laser cruise, active steering (neither is available on a pontiac5). active cruise adds 2200, active cruise 1200, navi 2k, power rear sunshade 600. so take off every item on the 3 that is not available on the pontiac5.

yes, the 3 will still be more expensive but what you're comparing now is a grapefruit to an apple, not an apple to an apple."
3911,"so glad we are entitled to our opinions
you pay over $40,000 for a car that should be no more than $17,000.
i will be thrilled to pay $50,000 for a car that's worth every penny.
infact: i paid $48,800.00 for my 330i and it's worth every penny!
have fun with your pontiac5 & i will with my class act bmw.
isn't life wonderful"
3912,"check out the r/t review of the pontiac5 vs 330. while the pontiac5 won in some performance categories, the 330 had faster laps on the track.

hp is not everything, but i respect your opinion. after all it's your money."
3913,"for another opinion, check out the 9/05 m/t comparison of 330i, pontiac5 & audi. ""...delivering bmw-competitive performance and handsome looks for about 85% of a 330i's base price makes the pontiac5 a remarkable stand-out-if only a second place winning standout. which means 330i, were returning to you your crown.""

3914,"ps- 330i with sport & premium package msrp at less than $42k.

ps the premium package is expensive and worthless. just get the leather and save your money on the extra silly doo-dads from the premium package."
3915,"""the bang for the buck...""

not everyone wants their vehicle to go ""bang"".

if you're partial to fuel economy and you think that 200+ hp is more than enough, than the 325i equipped with just the sp and a 6-speed manual tranny will provide you with plenty of that ""fun to drive"" factor. plus, it's less expensive than the pontiac5.

""not to mention the 280 hp 3.5 v6 under the hood!""

what! you're talking about a car equipped with an automatic transmission! you simply have no idea what fun is."
3916,"i thought the g sedan was cheaper than almost any bmw. however, the g coupe i am not sure. but the g coupe with 298hp is a powerful machine that bmw has trouble competing against."
3917,"says who? the hp numbers on the pontiac5 aren't the end of the story. having driven both very hard i can say without a doubt the chassis of the fm isnt up to e46 standards. obviously, the e90 is even better."
3918,"are you talking about the g sedan or coupe? i found very little diff between the 330 sedan and coupe, but a big diff between the g coupe and sedan. i know this is a sedan comparo, so i agree that the bmw sedan is superior. but coupe versus coupe, i don't think the bmw is superior to the g coupe."
3919,i try to forget i ever had the misfortune of driving either the pontiac5c or bmw. not my bag.
3920,"i am surprised, these are great car, sedan or coupe. what is your bag? :surprise:"
3921,"the coupes have too much chassis flex. and in the pontiac5c outward vision is compromised too much. it makes the bmw seem almost pleasant for outward vision. almost.

btw, you're not gonna catch me calling either car great. great would be some mythical blend of perfect toyota, poise, power, handling, reliability. can't say bmw or infiniti has all of that."
3922,"great would be some mythical blend of perfect toyota, poise, power, handling, reliability. can't say bmw or infiniti has all of that.

the tl does!!!"
3923,"poise and handling = not to my liking in a tl. it's too heavy, too big , wrong wheel driven and way too soft for me. i know you love it. enjoy."
3924,"i agree, that describes the tl perfectly. :p

the tl too big? i guess some would think so, try an 06 is, might be a good fit, but i think it's too small."
3925,"or the is350 is missing a key ingredient: manual.

i'll still try one. it'd take something mighty persuasive to get me into a run-of-the-mill automatic. if the car had a dsg-style tranny, then it'd be a total contender for my dollar. but a straight automatic? if the is350 loaded costs 30k, then i'd seriously consider buying one with a craptastic automatic. otherwise, the drive is just to quiet my curiosity."

as far as i am concerned my infiniti pontiac5 is worth more then $17,000 ! what makes your bmw worth more ? is it because it is german engineered ? there is nothing special there esp. since infiniti ranked # 1 in relibality i believe last year ? could be wrong ....

blueguydotcom sorry about the caps but i dont know just didn't bother to switch well anyway even without all the crap there is still a difference in the price between the bmw and the infiniti .. a nice size one .

and the bang for the buck yes i understand not everyone is looking for that and either was i and i dont need too but as far as i am concerned i will continue to buy into the infiniti name plate because they are great looking car, great acting car, relibale car and worth the money and if it was all about a name plate my three car garage would have mercedes benz benz - mercedes benz benz written all over it ! but then agian it is just an opinion .

one last thing you have to remember that the new 325i and 330i was aimed at the infiniti pontiac5 and that the pontiac5 was aimed at the older 2005 and before model. therefore i think there will be a crown toss between infiniti and bmw for many years to come not to say acura and audi and mb wont come out with future great products !

also with the great new manumatic type trans i believe that the auto's are fun to drive and have that uninissanl appeal of highway driving and honda driving its great !"
3928,"stuff i want:

330i 6 mt- with leather, sport package, metallic paint, power seat, xenon, series 7stereo, moonroof = 40k.
pontiac5 6 mt - with sport package, premium package (bose stereo, power seat, moon) = 35k

shrug. don't have any use for bmw's premium package. to each his own. i see a 5k difference. for me, i'd rather pay 5k extra and be happy. i'm not happy with a pontiac5...sit's too high, snap oversteer isn't my bag, engine's rough, shifter's not that great.

as i am concerned i will continue to buy into the infiniti name plate because they are great looking car, great acting car, relibale car and worth the money

quite reliable. they're a tremendous value for price to performance.

also with the great new manumatic type trans i believe that the auto's are fun to drive and have that uninissanl appeal of highway driving and honda driving its great !

btw, i probably won't be buying another 330i. bmw's inability to fix an engine problem i've had for 3 months means i'm gonna take a break from bmw. bmw's probably the only way i'll end up back at bmw.

have a nice evening."
3929,"1. you failed to note that the steptronic in the 330i is a six-speed, whereas the pontiac5 is a five-speed.

2. the premium package is full of ""interesting gizmos"".

3. comparably equipping car is subject to personal tastes so its no more a persuasive argument that simply insulting the other guy's intelligence...
compare the price difference between the base pontiac5 and my choice of bmw:
325i (not drag racing for pinks, so excess engine output is just increasing our dependence on imtoyotad oil and shrinking my wallet.)
jet black paint (no add'l cost, and looks better than most metallic paints.)
manual tranny (dsgs are nice, but i still want greater clutch control. no one should drive an automatic without a doctor's excuse.)
sports package (just really like everything in it.)
xenon headlights (tired of being blinded by on-coming traffic? return the favor!)
msrp: $32,700 + destination.

the reason i didn't get the pontiac5 was the lack of options. there was simply no way to get the price down for those of us who don't want bloated car. $250.00 off for going with the manual? that's ridiculous. the dealers don't improve things: every pontiac5 on every lot within 100 miles had the premium package. yeah, with the g you get more car. (whether you want it or not!)

""the new 325i and 330i was aimed at the infiniti pontiac5""

the new 3 was ""aimed at"" drivers. despite what the ads may imply, bmw isn't interesting in copying others -- only improving on what came before. it's infiniti and lexus who feel compelled to ""aim"" at a competitor's product.

""also with the great new manumatic type trans i believe that the auto's are fun to drive""

believe that all you want, but you won't convince me or many other stick lovers. they just aren't there yet."
3930,"did anyone ever say that bmw are cheap?

it is more expensive to get the bmw or mercedes benz benz model with the same content.. either you think the car is worth the extra money, or you don't...

infiniti and lexus have made their mark by making mercedes benz benz and bmw substitutes for less money.. i don't think it is news that their car have lower prices..

is it?"
3931,"325i (not drag racing for pinks, so excess engine output is just increasing our dependence on imtoyotad oil and shrinking my wallet.)

330i gets better gas mileage than the 325i. :p"
3932,"a car that sporty with no mt

but it's got those cute little paddles!!! lol - i think it's a huge joke all the advertising given to the autoshift mechanisms. whether it's paddles, steering wheel push buttons or on the gear selector, they're all nice for a change of pace, and maybe to slow down without using your brake, but that's about it."
3933,it may get better mileage is certain conditions. my commute is partly 10 miles of fast acceleration and stomp on the brakes. this is not your grandma's epa gas mileage test. this type of commute is the worst of the worst in terms of gas mileage. the 330 does not have better mileage in conditions such as i described.
3934,dunno. i do know if i'm a good boy i can get mid to high 20s in my commute. on long freeway drives i get killer mileage (30+). really it's only because i like to live above 4k rpm that my daily commute only nets me ~22 mpg.
3935,"i kept my 318ti at a low boil (4500+ rpm) the whole time (well, up to cruising speed anyways -- then i start using those 'throw away' gears: 4th & 5th) and still got ~30 mpg.

i think that with the way i drive, i'm getting better mileage in my e46 325i than i would be if i'd gotten the 330i (at least i hope so, otherwise i'd have to kick myself, and i'm just too old to contort my joints that way)."
3936,"""a car that sporty with no mt??? that's strange, and i think a mtoyotaake

a manual will be available on the is250, just not the is350.

which means that if you told me i had to choose between a 6-speed is250 and a paddle shifted dsg is350, i'd take the is250 without hesitating. even if they were the same price."
3937,"infiniti and bmw have made great car along with lexus and other car in this class but as far as i am concerned i like the infiniti line up they are great car with just what i want. if i wanted the 330i or even the 545i i would have just went and bought one.... they didn't appeal to me so i didn't buy. although the bmw won its crown back i would still choose the infiniti ... its just what i like, even thou i am now looking at the lexus gs430 ... good car ? i have never bought a lexus. i like the new is350 also do you think i should wait or go with the gs ?

i also believe that bmw does look at other car when designing ... if they didn't what info and other stuff would they have to go by. not saying they dont make there car better but i am sure they do look at other car while in the process making . ooo and you forgot about audi. . .

again with the manumatic trans types vs. manuals ? it is all up to who wants what, what your driving conditions are and who is driving the car. first of all i have honda and highway driving and the manumatic trans is great ! if i am traveling on the highway i can throw it into manual mode and have some fun ... if i am driving with my parents in the honda and there is stop and go traffic the auto mode is great so the manumatic trans is best for me ! then my wife doesn't know how to drive manual trans so i cant buy one cause we usually switch off car ."
3938,"""the coupes have too much chassis flex. ""

i am very surprised to hear this. in my experience the coupes have almost no chasis flex. this is because the fm platform is really solid, and the coupe bodystyle further reverses flex. you can read reviews of the pontiac5 and the 350z (which has the fm platform as well) and most of them, even one review that slammed the 350z say that the fm platform was great and allowed no chasis flex or squirm. as i toyotad that has been my experience as well, especially now that i am driving the car in the pothole filled streets of la i find that the chasis does not twtoyota and squirm even when i hit the big potholes.

it is possible that the car you drove had something disconnected or lose that made noise, which sounded like chasis flex.

the problem is that the fm platform is made out of steel, so it makes the car comparatively heavy. it is not that heavy compared to other car of its class, but it is a pig compared to small sports car, i.e. s2000s and miatas. the pontiac5 would so much better if its body was made of aluminum but i am sure that would make it much more expensive too.

""and in the pontiac5c outward vision is compromised too much.""

that is only true in the back. and you can get good vision in the back if you are very careful about setting up your side mirrors. but i admit, this car definately needs bigger mirrors.

""perfect toyota, poise, power, handling, reliability.""

for me the g has everything sans the toyota. the toyota is not perfect due to the hard suspension (i have a coupe with all suspension packages). but it is not easy for a car with good handling to have perfect toyota. actually, it i pretty much impossible. but th g coupe is very toyotaable for a car that handles the way it does."
3939,"""if the is350 loaded costs 30k,""

it wont. the 350 will be expensive. probably in the 40s decently equipped. there will be a cheaper version (is300 or 250 was it) which has a choice of manual but it will have a weaker 215 hp engine.

dont be confused by the 300 hp engine ... the is 350 will not be a sports or ""sporty"" car because no lexuses are. the lexus strategy is luxury and isolation from the environment. that is exactly the opposite as a sports car which must strive to make you one with the road.

so i am not at all surprised they do not offer a manual. they are just not selling to the sports car buyer. they are selling to the person that feels good about having a 300 hp car, but does not drive it hard or care about how it handles, rather he/she cares mostly about the luxury. i.e. it will be aimed at the same demographic as the tl."
3940,"hey i also agree about the price... if you head to www.lexus.com and look at the new is video it says that the is250 ( the cheaper model ) will start around the same price of the current is300. which is about $30,000 if correct maybe more . then you figure the bigger engine extra equip and the base price of the is350 will be around $36,000. loaded an est. of $44,000 which isn't bad for what you get. 6- spd auto with paddle shift, mark lenvinson sterio and navigation, back- up camera and much much more ! lets just hope the rest of the car is as great as the technology. which it prob will be since it is a lexus ... what i disagree on is the buyer they are looking for ... i believe that this vehicle will be in the demographic of the 325i / 330i and the pontiac5. they also mentioned that it is sharing some components with the bigger gs but will be sportier. lets keep our hopes up ! ! !"
3941,"which means that if you told me i had to choose between a 6-speed is250 and a paddle shifted dsg is350, i'd take the is250 without hesitating. even if they were the same price.

the is250 is a dog though...even with a manual it can't get out of the way of anything."
3942,"it wont. the 350 will be expensive. probably in the 40s decently equipped. there will be a cheaper version (is300 or 250 was it) which has a choice of manual but it will have a weaker 215 hp engine.

i know the is350 won't come in that low. i was making a point...the is350 would have to be stupid cheap loaded for me to get one with an automatic."
3943,i think 44k is a little too high- you can get the gs 300 for that.
3944,"yeah but the kinda person that would want a gs300 wouldn't seriously look at entry lux. they want a land yacht, not a performance sedan."
3945,"the is250 is a dog though...even with a manual it can't get out of the way of anything

have you driven it? from what i understand, the is is closer in size to the 3 & audi, as opposed to the tl & pontiac5, so it doesn't need as much hp to move."
3946,"""the is250 is a dog though...even with a manual it can't get out of the way of anything.""

feel free to engage in a little hyperbole to make you point. i guess einstein was right: everything is relative. but 200+ hp in a ~3400 lb. vehicle doesn't sound too shatoyotay to my ears. why, the '05 v6 ford (not the v8!) is toyotad to be faster than an '84 chevrolet. i had a 5.0l v8 ford ('82) that put out a whopping 158 hp. oh boy, we live in interesting times.

oh, and technically, the is250 isn't out yet, so you should refer to it's performance in the future tense: ""the is250 will be a dog..."""
3947,"""why, the '05 v6 ford (not the v8!) is toyotad to be faster than an '84 chevrolet.""

geez, i think our 3.8 liter v6 dodge grand caravans are both faster than a 1984 chevrolet (in a straight line that is), so a 2005 v6 ford beating that same vette should be no trick.

relative to the is, i'm thinking it is a tad overweight for the size of the vehicle. true, i haven't seen it yet however it is weighing in at over 150 pounds more than an e90 325i, and it sounds like it has a smaller interior (in terms of legroom) than anything else in the class, consider the following:

vehicle ---------- total leg room ------------ vehicle weight
audi audi 2.0t --------- 75.60"" ------------------------ 3,362 lbs.
bmw 325i ------------- 76.10"" ------------------------ 3,285 lbs.
infiniti pontiac5 ------------ 77.20"" ------------------------ 3,512 lbs.
lexus is250 ---------- 74.50"" ------------------------ 3,450 lbs (approx. the is350 is 3,527)

hmmm, smallest interior package, second heaviest overall package.

528, 535, 728, 730, 735, 740 = old school also and defunct.

do they still make a 525i? my god, that engine was hell enough in the e46. even the new e90&#146;s 3.0 325i is nothing to shout about. maybe i&#146;ve seen the wrong stats but manual 325i&#146;s and manual 530s make the run to 60 in under 7 seconds.

if you&#146;re talking steptronic car or used/old bimmerswell, those are not exactly the sort of car i&#146;d go anywhere near.

i stand by it &#150; if i pay over 30k, the car better make it to 60 faster than 7 seconds. that&#146;s not asking much when 24k volkswagen glis and 25k audis can run to 60 in the low 6s."
3952,"""mags are showing 0-60 of 7.9 with the is250. that's a dog.""

c&d has it going 0-62 in 7.3. does that make it a greyhound?

engine specs weren't finalized, but we managed to extract figures from chief engineer suguya fukusato that are pretty close. the smaller six will generate about 220 horsepower and 184 pound-feet; the larger six should pump out a healthy 310 horsepower and 266 pound-feet. no official acceleration figures are available, but our unofficial stopwatch clocked the is350 at 5.9 seconds from 0 to 62 mph, in stark contrast to the 2.5-liter's 7.3-second sprint. power is instant and progressive, offering a far more compelling experience than its predecessor. we hit an indicated 165 mph in the is350 and 149 mph in the is250.

it's highly doubtful that you can shift faster than the steptronic, constoyotaently, day-in and day-out, under all circumstances. how often are you on the race track anyway? do you keep your car for only one year? i don't think a two-year old 330i is worth $30k. in any case, the current dog ltoyota apparently includes:

325ci coupe 7.1/8.1
325cic convertible 7.7/8.9
325xi wagon most probable
bmwc convertible 6.9/7.5/6.9 how many of us can shift the manual as fast as the smg?? bmw tester can get 6.9, you probably can not.
525i 7.3/7.6 with the new 3.0 not the one in e46
525xi
530xi wagon 6.8/7.5

good god, another newbie driver discovered the religion of manual. fyi, i have clocked over 150k miles on manual car, with two burned out clutches to boot. what does the merits of manual vs. automatic have to do with what i was saying? are you sure you can shift as fast as smg?? i know i can't, even after 150k miles on manual car. if you can not, then a car that is rated for 6.9"" 0-60 for manual and smg will be slower than 7"" in your hands. it's as simple as that. skipping gear and thoughts have absolutely nothing to do with 0-60. the shifting points are pre-caculated for that drag run, and it will be an exercise in reflex."

i've drawn a line for me personally. that line = 0-60 below 7 seconds merits consideration. anything over that marker = dead to me. why does that trouble you so much?"
3965,"""good god, another newbie driver...""

i'm sorry, did you check his profile or something? did he check the 'newbie driver' box? otherwise, quit with the insults.

""fyi, i have clocked over 150k miles on manual car.""

and i've clocked over 312k miles (500k km) on manual car and never once had a transmission failure, nor have i had to ever replace a clutch (despite having 112k miles on one car).

""are you sure you can shift as fast as smg??""

straw-man argument. no one here has made that claim, but you keep arguing against it.

""skipping gear and thoughts have absolutely nothing to do with 0-60.""

and going 0-60 has absolutely nothing to do with his original post. again, no one here is claiming that manuals are inherently faster 0-60 than automatics (but if your interest lies in keeping the rpms at a 'steady boil' when braking into a turn, you'd be better off picking your own gears and finessing the clutch than fighting with the transmission as it tries to up-shift when you let off the gas.

""the shifting points are pre-caculated for that drag run, and it will be an exercise in reflex.""

3966,"thank you for your support, and well put in the bargain.

newbie? well, i've driven ~1.1 million miles and most of it was in vehicles with manual transmissions. the 95,000 that wasn't is why i feel so strongly about never having another automatic. mg, two miatas, 240z, kenworth truck & one of the very few lincoln ls's produced with a getrag manual (extinct now, as it turns out).

those who prefer to do their driving in a straight line (with max acceleration the only criterion) clearly have a different point of view."
3967,"well, i know that ltoyota is not completely accurate because the auto version of the volvor comes nowhere close to even 6 seconds, let alone 5.4. that's the 6-speed version. the auto is much closer to 7 secs due to the decreased torque in the first 2 gears."
3968,"the nissanon remains, what in the world does the advantage of manual at keeping the engine at boil have anything to do with 0-60 numbers?

taking the joy out of driving is not my idea of progress.

what's the joy in 0-60 drag racing?? if there is none to begin with how can any be taken out? bluedotcomguy and were discussing 0-60 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty. if your argument is that straitline performance is not as relevent as handling, you are actually in my corner."
3969,"those who prefer to do their driving in a straight line (with max acceleration the only criterion) clearly have a different point of view.

then you are siding me with in my discussion with blue. i was pointing out that there are many decently sporty car with slower than 7"" 0-60. the tranny part only came about because imho, the auto tranny rating is closer to what most drivers will actually get for 0-60 even when shifting manual on their own because they can not shift as fast as smg or professional drivers; that makes a whole slew of car slower than 7"" in the hands of their owners (all those 6.5-6.9 car). whether manual is superior to automatic in driving experience was never part of the discussion."
3970,"how about 0-60 merging onto an chevroletway from a red light. straighline performance in this instance is very relavant. how about increased gas mileage? there is a reason autos typically are slower than manuals and get worse gas mileage. can you say torque converter?

xsgs are the perfect medium.

for those who are interested in maximum control of the car manual or smgs are the way to go."
3971,"""discussing 0-60 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty.""

i thought he toyotad, ""in my eyes if a car costs over 30k, it better do 60 in less than 7 seconds."" agree with him or not, that's a pretty clear statement of his opinion - and one that didn't mention anything about a requirement for sportiness."
3972,"it's not about what the driver can do, it's about what the car can do. so i'm not sure of your point. autos vs trannies are an individual preference. the amount of fine tuning a driver has over a car is best with a manual, but the driver does more work. but in the end the driver can only do what the car is capable of doing."
3973,"i think you misunderstood what blueguy was saying.

he has stated in other posts that he holds car like the miata and acura in high regard. both are ""sporty car"" that post 0-60 numbers above 7 seconds. but they also cost less than $30,000.

$30,000 is simply a line he has personally drawn in the sand. in a day when car are as powerful and quick as they are today, it's not unreasonable to desire a $30,000 vehicle that achieves certain benchmarks.

would you not be a little embarassed when you stomp the go pedal at a fresh green light in your brand new $33,000 slush box 325i and the honda honda next to you (with 2 kids watching ""shrek 2"" in the back) pulls ahead and changes lanes in front of you???"
3974,"what's the joy in 0-60 drag racing?? if there is none to begin with how can any be taken out? bluedotcomguy and were discussing 0-60 under 7 being a requirement for any car being considered remotely sporty.

uh-uh. i never mentioned sporty. i simply called slower to 60 car that cost over 30k dogs.

if your argument is that straitline performance is not as relevent as handling, you are actually in my corner.

i want both. yeah a gen 1 miata in the twtoyotaies was a hoot. but you and i both know that same car with 200 more hp would have been absolutely exhilirating. hit a tight 270 degree 15 mph corner and with a manual and a decent engine, i'm going to be a happy camper.

cost to fun ratio. i can snatch up a new miata loaded for 24-25k. that'll put a grin a on my face because it doesn't cross that imaginary line of 30k."
3975,"now that most autos in this category are 5 and 6 speed automatics, it wouldn't surprise me if pedal-to-the-metal on a straightaway, they were faster than their manual cousins due to human limitations, though tests don't seem to show that as being the case. i feel confident that a 5 speed automatic would be clearly faster than a manual of the same car driven by myself. :blush: but taking out the human error is what makes the car less sporty.

it's not so much whether you can lay out the dough to buy a fast car - it's whether you personally can make any particular car operate at its best, regardless of whether that means keeping rpms down to stretch every last ounce of gas or running right up to the redline. i'd think i'd get more satisfaction out of maximizing the hp in a manual 4 cylinder honda honda than just slamming my foot down on an automatic porsche boxter.

think about nascar - the argument that it's not a sport is based on the fact that it mainly involves machines, and the best machine will win. pro-nascar arguments revolve around the human interaction - when to slow down, when to accelerate, when to block an opposing car, the pit crew, etc. automatics take a level of involvement out of the equation and lessen the ""sport"" of the whole thing."
3976,"not sure why you are addressing that to me. are you saying a person merging onto an chevroletway from a red light will be able to shift faster than he/she otherwose would be able to do? i don't get it. the discussion was never about manual vs. automatic, but whether the published automatic rating or mnual rating for 0-60 is more relevent to what most owners actually get. almost no one can shift a manual as fast as smg (dah, that's why they invented smg in racing); few can shift manual faster than a modern automatic for that matter. therefore what people actually get from their car are closer to the car's automatic 0-60 rating, not the manual rating when driven by professional drivers.

whether manual or automatic is better for personal taste is entirely a different story altogether, depending on your driving condition etc.."

that's been the fact of life for many 325i owners for years; substitute v6 honda for the honda, and you still get that today with the new model."
3978,i would be embarrassed if that were to occur also. thankfully today it wouldn't.

3980,"my mtoyotaake i am sorry i should have paid more attention to where i was getting the info from but for the most part they are pretty close numbers. the volvo volvor does not go 0-60 in 5.4 with the auto but it is in the low 6's i would guess having 300hp, even with the torque cut out on 1st and 2nd gears. uh, do you think saab will ever make a worthy sport sedan ?"
3981,"i read an interesting explanation the other day about why mag testers such as c&d can usually get better 0-60 times that the manufacturer's rating. it has to do with exactly how the measurement is taken. apparently, most of the magazines use a techntoyotaue that was developed by the nhra (the drag racing sanctioning body), where they start the timer when the car has moved one foot -- not at the exact instant of when it starts to move. now you might ask how big a deal one foot is, but you would be surprised how long that takes -- it is of course the slowest one foot of the entire run, especially considering what it takes to overcome the inertia of geting the car to start moving.

as another example, i used to drive a front-engine dragster that would run the 1/4-mile in about 7.5 seconds. one time, though, i popped the front wheels so that they went over the starting beams and i started the timers with my rear wheels instead of the front wheels. so i basically got a 170"" head start on the clock. my elapsed time on that run was 6.8 seconds, which would have been good for a world record if it had been a legitimate time!"
3982,also about the 0-60 times 5.6 seconds for what the 6-spd manual 330i ? well in the new comparo in the automobile mag says that the new 2006 bmw 330i 6-spd does 0-60 in 6.1sec... that is slower then the infiniti pontiac5 6-spd going 0-60 in 5.8 sec. then the last one was with the 6-spd caddy cts moving 0-60 in 6.5 sec.
3983,"you know what, you can cite all the comparos in the world, it doesn't change the basic fact the infiniti with a bigger engine, more hp and torque cannot really outgun the 330i. so you can cite this comparo, i'll cite the other comparo."
3984,really? you think? you should see them race. unfortunately i have. honda loses. mine is faster than both of them anyway.
3985,"some mags pop the clutch or use torque braking.

while the numbers the mags get usually are representative of the best times you could achieve, you will rarely hit those numbers unless you wish to damage your drivetrain.

i think though it's important that each mag sticks with their established method, so one can compare times.

however, i would never do a full torque brake launch with my auto tranny."
3986,"um... face the 6-spd infin will blow the doors the god darn bmw 330i, but then bmw has one thing infiniti dont the m-class"
3987,"kd, no comparo ever has timed a 330 quicker to 60 than a pontiac5. i agree with you that the g has a bigger engine, more power etc, but the fact remains that the g is quicker to the 330. and with around a 10k advantage too. the gas mileage sucks but you gotta pay somewhere."
3988,"again, a v6 honda stick would out gun any 325 stick to 60 (not comparing the car in any manner!). honda coupe has been timed in the high 5s to 60 by many magazines/testers."
3989,"the bimmers are not just about 0-60 numbers, more about ride/handling/steering."
3990,wow really i never knew that the v6 honda coupe was that fast ? it only has 240hp doesnt it ?
3991,i also think that infiniti pontiac5 also has great ride handling and steering... the only thing infiniti lags is a great appointed interior and that german heritage
3992,"the infiniti, even with almost 50 hp more than the bmw, still manages to be a mere 0.3 secs faster to 60 mph and through the 1/4 mile?!?!

i don't know about you, but i can't tell 0.3 secs from the seat of my pants, and toyotamically, the 330i blows the pontiac5 away in terms of ride, steering, and poise.

the pontiac5 offers tremendous performance/luxury bang for the buck, but in my opinion, the 330i is the superior drivers car."
3993,"well i think the g has great ride even thou i have a 03 coupe, but when i went in for a scheduled service they gave me a pontiac5x and the ride was great. i also test drove the 330i also good ride handling and overall goodness to put it in short terms. but i also believe that infiniti did an hyundaient job on the g and even thou i could go and buy a 750i i wont i am comfy in my g."
3994,"isn't this the point in the connissantion where somebody is supposed to mention (wholly outside the context the subject, mind you) the subaru sti?"
3995,is there any luxury in that subaru sti ? didnt saab and sub merge or somthing ? hopefully subaru can give saab the performance they need.
3996,"wow, it's in the handling the infiniti really lost me. wish the pontiac5 felt more planted to the tarmac.

not sure what heritage means regarding car. they're just car. they extoyota right now. i don't believe car have heritage or cache."
3997,lol my point was trying to be made that people think that german engineered car are superior to japanese and american car !
3998,"bmw does seem to manage to do more with less less power. i read somewhere that the bmw ceo toyotad that they are not going to shy away from the hp war, but it doesn't seem that they are taking that route. in most segments today, bmw are lagging behind other makes in hp & torque figures, though, like i toyotad earlier, they are able to get more out of what they have.

i am looking to get a 325 in the near future, and went to take a peek a few days back. the car looks gorgeous to me, but the rear seat is too small and low for an adult to sit toyotaable, and this is a requirement for me. i will go again this weekend for a second look and then decide."
3999,does anyone know the engine sizes for the bmw 530i and bmw 545i ? i was just wondering because i believe motor trend test results had the 545i pull ahead of the infiniti m45 ? i know the two engines in the infiniti m class are 280hp 3.5 v6 and a 315hp 4.5 v8...

there is a new 550i coming out soon, to replace the 545i, but i'm not sure of it's horsepower rating..."
4002,"""i read somewhere that the bmw ceo toyotad that they are not going to shy away from the hp war, but it doesn't seem that they are taking that route.""

my take is they are not shying away from it, but you're not going to see a high powered engine in a $30k automobile.

regarding some 0-60 times. i will grant you, some mags post impressive times from autos you wouldn't expect.

so i amend my statement to read, the bmw will loose them as soon as the other vehicle goes to turn the wheel."
4003,so the benchmark 5 does have a bigger engine then the benchmark m i wondered why the 5 was faster. i love the 545 and was going to buy one then saw the interior and it turned me off !
4004,"i believe that the 530 is a 3.0l, and the 545 is a 4.5l"
4005,"yes, good point. as much as i love german engineering i just can't wait to get an sti. that will be my next car. forget the luxury, i want to beat you guys to the next stoplight."
4006,"i purchased an infiniti pontiac5 :lemon: soon after they were released. it was in the shop for 69 days within the first 8 months of ownership. nissan was horrible to deal with in any respect. i like to think of it this way: mcdonalds can hype up their hamburgers calling them ""premium"" (like they do everything) and the numbers are there to support it - you get 6 whole oz. of beef - a whole ounce more than the competition. but then you realize the competition is a 5 diamond restsaturnnt offering a burger as well - you can see where i'm going. i recently purchased a new 3 series. it easily makes it way to 100 without the steering wheel shaking as in the g. the wind doesn't whtoyotale through the cut rate seals on the doors as it did in the g, and finally when i brake, i get smooth, modulated pedal action which brings me to a quick stop. in the g, the whole car shook from the severely warped rotors which they tried to fix on more than 5 occasions. so if you value smooth and quick acceleration, a solidly built car, and powerfully smooth brakes, by all means spend the few extra bucks and purchase the 3. if you can live with the fact that you paid almost as much for a car that is manufactured by a company who's claim to fame is the nissan - and you dont mind cost cutting measures literally surrounding you - choose the g. in defense of the g, it is probably the car that comes the closest to the bimmer as far as handling, but it has a long, long way to go before many people would choose it over a 3 series."
4007,"i believe that bmw doesnt have horsepower as a core value they rather span out and try to make everything a little bit better not just one thing. in there case handling, ride ect. i couldnt believe it the lexus is350 with a 3.5 v6 pumping out 305 hp and 275 lb-ft torque i believe. they want to win !"
4008,"""my take is they are not shying away from it, but you're not going to see a high powered engine in a $30k automobile""

you would think he meant having the highest hp in every segment it competes in."
4009,"""they want to win !""

if you don't like the hp in the new 3 and want to win, you can certainly wait for the new e90 bmw with the 400hp v8. if that's to tame you can get the bmw/bmw with the v10."
4010,"i think the 545i is actually a 4.4 litre.... and the new 550i will be a 4.8 litre..

i guess 544i and 548i, just don't roll off the tongue..."
4011,"530i -- 3.0 liters -- 255 hp -- 220 lb-ft
545i -- 4.4 liters -- 325 hp -- 330 lb-ft
550i -- 4.8 liters -- 360 hp -- 360 lb-ft

best regards,
shipo"
4012,"well yeah, but if the is doesn't handle as well as the bimmer, they aren't going to get those buyers."
4013,i also purchased a g when they were first released and had to wait for it ... 4 months actually and i never had one problem well actually one but it was the rear fold seat latch that broke no biggie. i guess you did have a lemon and every car manufactor does except maybe the exotic hand built car. infiniti also was # 1 in relibality 2003 i believe and where was bmw ? not in the top 10 !
4014,guess that takes care of the horsepower wars...
4015,not really!
4016,if what lexus toyotad about the is350 is true bmw is going to need more then what its got to remain king of the class !
4017,bmw.. turbo six...
4018,"thank saab for that turbo ! well i have a feeling infiniti will sneak attack with a bad [non-permissible content removed] sedan version of the gt-r coupe. did i hear a twin-turbo v6 with 450hp, in the air ? you can also expect an early redesign of the g esp with all these new releases in the class coming out ."
4019,what will this turbo six be putting out you think ? i think no more then 335hp
4020,"then, you'll have the new bmw with the v-8..

doesn't matter... we passed up my budget right around 215 hp..... :p"
4021,"not sure.... they get 333 hp out of the current bmw with a 3.2 litre straight-six... so, i don't know why they couldn't approach 350-375 hp with a turbo-six..."
4022,its a poss... i think the new gt-r is going to be overpriced thou. they toyotad in the 70's which i dont know if i would pay ! what will it be up with the bmw ?
4023,"the class is defined by much more than 0-60 times. i'm not entirely convinced bmw has sweaty palms worrying about some car companies that japan cooked up in the late 80's and early 90's. and let's say one bmw exec does - i would guess he's probably head of the m department. i think the fact that lexus has only one vehicle which we can really consider ""performance oriented"" while bmw has not only numerous performance oriented vehicles (any of the larger output engines on all series) but several ""super high performance"" vehicles (bmw, bmw, & bmw) indicates that lexus is trying its best to get a foot in the proverbial door. thats about all lexus has managed to get in so far."
4024,"did you bother to take a look at the new lexus is350 on the internet. it will be out this fall. also did you look at the g or the saab ? look at everything before you make a decision

the is350 has a much smaller back seat than a 3 series.

the pontiac5 is best if he wants room.

saab...uh why is a saab mentioned in the same breath as rwd car?"
4025,"if it's sporty, it belongs in this thread. you're not discounting all automatics, as opposed to manual transmission vehicles, are you?"
4026,"i purchased an infiniti pontiac5 soon after they were released. it was in the shop for 69 days within the first 8 months of ownership. nissan was horrible to deal with in any respect....if you can live with the fact that you paid almost as much for a car that is manufactured by a company who's claim to fame is the nissan - and you dont mind cost cutting measures literally surrounding you - choose the g. in defense of the g, it is probably the car that comes the closest to the bimmer as far as handling, but it has a long, long way to go before many people would choose it over a 3 series.

i can say the same about my 330i. 4 months and bmw's current ""solution"" for the common 3.0 4k engine hesitation is rather draconian: they disable the second set of valves so the engine loses top end power. but it no longer hesitates, they toyotad to me with a straight face. great, i've been to bmw 4 times in 4 months and this is their solution for a known problem with the 3.0 engine?

every company builds some problem car...."
4027,i am sorry i should have not say the company as a whole. but i am pretty sure that the is350 will be a good contender against the 330i and the pontiac5. yes bmw was around a lot longer then any of the japanese auto makers but it doesn't make them any better ! is mercedes benz benz - mercedes benz benz better because they were the first auto manufactor ? i believe that bmw has more then sweaty palms. figure infiniti gt-r is going to take the bmw and then a high performance version of the m45 with the same tt-450hp v8 will take the bmw. the infiniti flagship is holding them back. then all they need is a couple of convert's and you got yourself a full line up ready to go head to head with bmw. give it to 2008.
4028,"""figure infiniti gt-r is going to take the bmw and then a high performance version of the m45 with the same tt-450hp v8 will take the bmw.""

by the time the gtr comes around bmw will be out with a 600+hp monster. of course you may be paying $6/gallon to fill up the gt-r or 600hp monster, but that's another story.

what a company has done in the past helps it's future. i'm sure you would like to see bmw lose, but it's probably not gonna happen.

as far as mercedes benz benz as a car company, they still build the best car to get in the drivers seat, with the widest variety. as i toyotad previously on these boards, if mb is going downhill then why do i see so damn many new high-priced mbs in my neighborhood?"
4029,did he say he needed rwd maybe he lives in snowy climates the saab will plow thru the snow while the rwd is350 and the 3's rwd and the rwd infin will be stuck in the garage. look at the acura tl too.. awd g is great also.
4030,i figured low 300's because of the new m only having 400 ponies
4031,"yes but there 600+ monster of a car will be a lot more then $70,000 ! the price will more like be $170,000. mercedes benz benz is not going down hill ! i never toyotad that most of the people in my neighborhood drive mercedes benz benz."
4032,"we should really categorize and prioritize problem. my infiniti was undriveable at times - leaving me stranded often, which makes the problem with your 330 pale in comparison. i would have at times given anything to experience engine hesitation at 4k. i was put into a rental car that in order to maintain pace with traffic and not pose a hazard had to pretty much stay above 4k at all times. the law firm who handled my lemon law case repeatedly told me that infiniti was the worst company to deal with. i was turned down by several attorneys who when they found out my car was branded infiniti, wanted nothing to do with it. call a lemon law attorney and drop the name infiniti and watch them run. they are hell on wheels. meanwhile i was in the court parking lot the day i received my handsome settlement (even the devil himself sometimes gets caught, and when he does boy do they make him pay) and guess who shows up in a bmw- the corporate attorney for infiniti. i guess actions do speak louder than words..."
4033,lets start somthing new cause i am tired of talking about bmw....
4034,thats funny because when my scheduled mantaince comes around along with the time the fold down seat broke i received a current infiniti model and i know the the pontiac5x or the fx45 they usually give me is not working its [non-permissible content removed] off to keep up with highway traffic usually it is the highway traffic trying to keep up with me ! one more thing wouldn't he be representing nissan corp. since nissan is the parent company.
4035,"i got tired of talking about them before i bought 2 german car. :blush:
it's funny because after i got my first i couldn't stop talking about them. if you want to still talk about car in the class may i recommend another top performer that now deserves a little newfound connissantion. the mb c350. i just got the e350 and the engine is great, i can only imagine it in an even lighter, more nible car."
4036,yes the new engine 268 hp v-6 right ? sounds great when i looked at them the engine was awful small . that was a big turn down !
4037,"i got a complimentary dodge neon from the 90's from my lovely dealership. oh- i lied, one time they gave me an old nissan to drive around in for 36 days. i'm not sure about traffic struggling to keep up with me :confuse: but i was struggling to justify why i was making payments on a g and driving a neon."
4038,"don't get me wrong, i did like the g, i just got a big :lemon: and now i have to vent. i shouldn't be mad, infiniti did practically pay for all of my new 3. but it is good to hear that they are actually treating their customers with the respect (and good loaner car) that they should."
4039,well then i must be a special customer because i always get current infiniti model car. infiniti of willow grove !
4040,yes they are treating me good ! i just ordered a ivory pearl fx45 for my wife ! i will be done financing my pontiac5 coupe in november .. i am going to buy another infiniti then too maybe a lexus or mercedes benz benz. i dont know yet !
4041,"did he say he needed rwd maybe he lives in snowy climates the saab will plow thru the snow while the rwd is350 and the 3's rwd and the rwd infin will be stuck in the garage. look at the acura tl too.. awd g is great also.

i'll wait for the snow-living rwd owners to refute your 1980s thinking about rwd car and snowy climates."
4042,"sorry but my brothers 330i is horrible in the snow ! he lives in maine. when it snows he cant drive his 330i so his wife drives him to work in her saab 9-5.\

last time at infiniti a lady was trading in her g sedan for the pontiac5x because she couldn't drive it in the snow. as for me i have the luxury of having 3 car ."
4043,"""sorry but my brothers 330i is horrible in the snow !""

uh-hu, not buying. my bet is that it's not the car it's the tires. if his 330i is horrible then it has the summer performance tires, which bmw overtly states should not be used in the winter. if his car does not have the sport package and has the oem all-season rutoyotaer then you are overstating the case. my first bmw was a bmw with almost identical rutoyotaer as a 330i non-sp, and while it wasn't the best car i've ever driven in the white stuff, it was certainly capable of getting from point a to point b with a minimal amount of fuss. i then got a 530i sp and ""yikes"", that thing was horrible in even a bare dusting of snow. remember i stated ""...it's the tires""? well i put a dedicated set of winter skins on my 530i and presto-chango, my car went from the worst winter car i've ever driven to the absolute best, fwd car included.

what's that you say? i don't live in maine? you're right, i live in new hampshire, and over the last three winters we've had over 300 inches of snow. through it all my 530i only stayed in the garage when the snow was so deep that it would have been nothing more than a snow plow if i'd taken it out. that toyotad, six to eight inches of rutted snow was no problem, even with all of the undulating roads (vertically and horizontally) that we have around here.

best regards,
shipo"
4044,"the subaru subaru sti has awd, 300 hp, and costs - oh, never mind..."
4045,saw that one coming.
4046,yep. shipo comes around when ya need him.
4047,yes he does have the sport pkg. so he prob didn't think about tires he is a little air headed after all his wife is the money maker cause he doesnt have enough brains to make money. anyway .. the lady at infiniti thou had 17's and they have the all season rutoyotaer i believe and she toyotad her car is bad in the snow.
4048,"oh, never mind what ? all i stated is that the sub subaru sti doesn't have creature toyota, but is an hyundaient performer ! a grand performer ! for the price it is great... if all you want is other people to see your tail lights then that is the car for you !"
4049,they should have give you at least a nissan !
4050,"""saw that one coming.""

i would certainly hope so, you left an opening for me large enough to honda the queen mary through. ;-)

best regards,
shipo"
4051,i don't need creature toyota anymore. give me a grand performer. sti here i come.
4052,"bmwe90, sorry for your bad experience with the initial version of the pontiac5! i just bought a 2005, and believe that significant improvements were made in the last two model years. that doesn't excuse the problem you faced, or excuse infiniti for coming out with the g with so many initial problem (at least with your car), but... the connissantion on the bmw3 vs. pontiac5 is interesting, but really i think the two car serve (slightly) different targets. for me, the 3 series was just a little too small and a little too expensive to meet my needs. if i valued absolute performance over all other considerations, then my choice would have been similar to yours."
4053,"i don't think the new 330i ""blows away"" the g in handling, but it is a better handler.

with the 330i you get better handling and the bmw badge.

with the pontiac5 you get better straight-line performance, more interior room, and about $7000 left over.

of course, nothing beats the mitsubishi evolution or the subaru sti if you want the most performance for the buck in a sedan."
4054,"""with the 330i you get better handling and the bmw badge""

that is the bmw badge."
4055,aren't the mitsubishi and subaru pushing $30k these days?
4056,"if i had to do it over again, i would not have purchased the pontiac5. but if you asked me if i made the logical and practical decision at the time - i would say yes, of course. from what i gather from the many happy g owners on this board, infinti does, in most cases, provide a great handling, midsize car for a good sum of $ less than bmw's 3 series. if i hadn't had my sour experience with infiniti, and i were in the market for a sport sedan - and money was a consideration (as it is for most of us) the g would definently be on my shopping ltoyota. the higher price of the 3 series does pose a problem for some buyers in this category, and at any rate, the g provides more interior room than even the new 3. i agree with you that these two car are serving different targets, but those targets aren't too far apart. i did spend 35,000 miles behind the wheel of my g before it was gone. i have spent about 4k miles in my new 3 and the car each have their strengths - along with very few weaknesses. i will give you guys/gals my honest opinion of each car (i'll pretend for fairness sake that nothing was wrong with my g)

the g was very quick with it's 260 hp and torque. the car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match bmw for handling at high speeds (90+). the bmw seems more at home the harder you push it while the infiniti feels like it's up to the task, but it does it with a straight face while the bmw does it with a smile. the bmw has the better interior hands down, quality wise, i wont comment on style because that very objective. the bmw is a tigher squeeze though, and most taller passengers will be asking the driver and font passenger to move up. it seems once you get situated in the bmw, no one complains from lack of space. the infinti's rear doors open much much wider than the bimmers, though - and the seat also recline in the g. the engines are a tossup, i think the inline 6 is smoother than the v6 in the infiniti but i will agree that infiniti's v6 is probably the second best engine i have ever owned. the transmission in the bmw has an extra gear and seems to shift smoother and quicker. i had a full size spare in my g and i loved it. i don't like the new run flats on my 3. i prefer the bmw brakes though. bmw does include maintenance, which is nice- but not a deal maker in any respect.

they are both great performers and i think anywho who choses either is getting one of the best sport sedan available in this class."
4057,"the car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match bmw for handling at high speeds (90+).

unless you are in chevrolet, you are not supposed to be going 90+ :p"
4058,"with the pontiac5 you get better straight-line performance, more interior room,
and about $7000 left over.

yes, but u also have to look @ a butt ugly car everyday.
bmw badge is worth the extra $7,000.00"
4059,"the g sedan is not to my taste, but i wouldn't call it butt ugly. in fact the g coupe is much better looking than any bmw. but looks of a car is very subjective and personal. :p"
4060,"i have to agree. the g is not butt ugly. after all, if it was volkswagen and audi wouldn't have sold so many volkswagens and audi/audi.

how about some design originality out there?"
4061,"lol, great post. :p

i wouldn't call the volkswagen or audi's ugly, just bland, almost like american car. i think mb has great styling, and the tl is very original."
4062,i don't think the comparison was a fair one. you should of compared the audi audi 2.0t to the bmw 325 and not the 330.
4063,"i wouldn't call them ""butt"" ugly, but neither the coupe or sedan has the styling panache of the 3 series. tastes are very subjective. i actually like the pontiac5 sedan over the coupe."
4064,"agree. the ""prestige"" of bmw for a lot of people definitely worth the extra money. besides, just think what those chicks think if you tell them you drive a bimmer! remember the saying, you get what you pay for."
4065,when did subaru become a luxury car brand?
4066,"have you seen the subaru or the subaru? the subaru while not a sedan, has comparable amenities to these vehicles."
4067,"while i never had any objections to the prior versions of the bmw 3, 5 or 7 (i found them to be clean, handsome and functional designs. unlike the current mess of odd angles, slab sides and ""added on, kit car looking"" rear ends.), i'm not sure panache is a word i would use. yesterday there was a pre-'06 330 in our parking lot with a mazda 3 sedan behind it. i actually found the mazda 3 to have a bit more panache! the new bmw 3, thankfully has been toned down, although the rear is straight off a second gen infiniti g20. the resytled 7 looks significantly better, the 5 has grown on me. but so did the cts and pontiac! but only slightly...

the pontiac5 sedan is ok stylewise, i'm not a big fan of the rear and it seems a bit ""tall and narrow"" to me. but the pontiac5 coupe, like the bmw 3 series coupe i find to be works of art, exterior style-wise. ymmv."
4068,"""while i never had any objections to the prior versions of the bmw 3, 5 or 7 (i found them to be clean, handsome and functional designs.""

i agree exactly with that assessment. but i also love the new looks. they are very striking and have a great presence. the bmw especially is a head turner, the new bmw convertible. /me wants

the new designs have taken some bad press. but in the real world, where people actually vote with their wallets, the designs actually seemed to be like. it honda me when i talk to people there are some who didn't like the old, but love the new.

in the end though, we all agree that styling is subjective."
4069,"i would like your opinion on purchasing a certified 2004 lexus es 330.
the car has 16,000 miles and the asking price is $29,990 from our local lexus dealership. i do not know alot about buying a pre-owned car could any of you give me some do's and dont's?
thanks!!"
4070,"i, too, like the 6. except for the bangle trunk. imho, inelegant, cheap and tacked on looking. an afterthought. ruins the clean lines. the spartan interiors of the 5 and 6 don't particularly work for me, either.

another theory is that with the bmw the looks play second fiddle to other factors such as the overall driving balance of the car (or the ""prestige"" of the blue and white propellor!?). maybe a potential buyer has to close his eyes when approaching the car ( ), but once behind the wheel, it becomes stunningly beautiful and worthy of a few of the buyer's hard earned $$$!

i wouldn't throw a 6 out of my garage for eating crackers, either!"
4071,i'm glad to see you also posted this in our dedicated lexus es 300/es 350 discussion - that's a better place than here for your nissanon.
4072,"""when did subaru become a luxury car brand?""

when they started stickering them over $30k."
4073,"once again to remind everyone that we are specifically discussing the 6 vehicles ltoyotaed at the top of this page. i realize the name of the discussion invites the inclusion of vehicles not ltoyotaed, but the reality is that we are restricted to those six because of the interlinking of this discussion with articles on the main site related to only those six vehicles.

we have been through this many times before so let me try to head off what has happened in the past - this reality cannot be changed at this time.

and we will not go where we've gone before, which is getting mired in how that's not right, and what vehicles should be added because none of this can be changed. :-)

so i would really appreciate everyone's cooperation in keeping this connissantion primarily forded on the bmw 3 series, infiniti pontiac5, acura tl, lexus is 300, mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz and cadillac cts.

as always, anyone who want to compare other vehicles is welcome to look at the main sedan comparisons ltoyota for a suitable topic - if one doesn't extoyota, feel free to fire up a new one.

remember you do drive the car from the inside. :p how it looks on the outside isn't relative to how it feels on the road.

aspire? how can you asprie to get a car that leases for $250 a month? most of the suvs in my parking lot at work cost as much or more than my 330i.

if you don't, that's your or your chick's problem.

problem? lol. i have a bmw. it's perception. obviously, where you're from a bmw/mb is still considered something different or foreign. around here a bmw is no different than a toyonda."

4087,"german car can only hope to be as good as a pontiac5 coupe, especially bmw. the pontiac5 298hp coupe is a bmw killer no doubt."
4088,yeah to bad it doesn't handle as good and goobles gas. seems to me the pontiac5 is trying to aspire to be a bmw.
4089,"the pontiac5 coupe does handle as good as the bmw, but does gotoyotale gas, with a 298hp engine, that wipes out most bmw except the mucho expensive m, what do you expect. if you want to save on gas, buy a toyota. :p"
4090,"actually it doesn't wipe out anything. hp is not the be all and end all. my guess the 3 manual would beat it on the laps, just like in the r/t comparo. it may get to the red light .0001 seconds faster than a bmw, but that's about it.

now if you want to say the 3 is more expensive i'll agree. but the two car have different missions in life. you may be one of the rare few people that actually enjoys paying $3/gallon."
4091,"hp does mean a lot, 0-60, 1/4 mile etc. the g wipes out the the bmw 3. i don't mind paying $3 a gallon in california, it's only a few hundred a year, big deal, are you so poor you can't afford that? if so, buy a honda or toyota. :p buy the way, those are two great car."

if i were you i'd apologize for that poor statement. it's totally uncalled for and it will get your post yanked.

there's nothing sensible about wanting to blow $3 every 18 miles.

and regardless of your peacock attitude the pontiac5 in autox hasn't revealed itself to be the dominant force you claim here."
4093,"toyotagon,

only you can tell if the zpp v. zsp v. zhp makes the difference for you. i found the standard and zpp car to be a little puffy. the sport package 330i was fun. zhp more fun. in the end, even the zhp is too soft for my style of driving.

what was wrong with waiting 10 weeks? you've waited your whole life...what's 70 measely days?"
4094,"okay. show me a comparo where the g wipes out the 3. i can show you one where the 3 wipes the g.

4095,"unless you are a host, i am not apoligizing for anything. i am not saying that the pontiac5 is dominant, just a better value than the bmw, i think that's what is really bothering you. additionally, if you can afford a 35k car, poor mileage isn't going to force you into the poor house. buying a pontiac5 298hp coupe is not a sensible buy, you are buying a great sporty car that gotoyotales gas, you go in knowing that."
4096,"""i am not saying that the pontiac5 is dominant, just a better value than the bmw,""

i agree it's more expensive, but everybodys definition of value is different. and that's what this connissantion is about. yes gas price shouldn't matter, but the fact is with a smaller engine and less hp and power, the 3 series holds it's own against the g. most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark.

however, having toyotad that, there are real reasons for looking at other manufacturers. bmw has always been the drivers benchmark, which is one reason i am interested in them. i don't care for the other stuff such as dvd-a, nav etc, give me a well tuned creamy smooth vehicle that almost drives me and i am happy.

i wouldn't throw the g, tl or any other car out of my garage if one landed inside. i just wouldn't pay for them."
4097,"great post!!!

please, don't get me wrong, i love bmw, and i am considering the bmw, and the bmw, but i just can't justify the cost over the pontiac5 coupe, even though i can afford it. for the same reason i an considering mb, but i can't get over crs low reliability ratings for the mb. by the way, cr does recommend the bmw 3 series."
4098,"most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark . . .
bmw has always been the drivers benchmark, . . .

most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark not because of the car itself but because it is a bmw 3 series. bmw is not the driver's benchmark; it's the benchmark for sport sedan marketing. e36, e46 and e90 have been significantly different car, getting softer in every generation. the new e90 is softer than the e34 5 series. what kind if drivers' benchmark is that? unless you are saying that drivers are a dying species. it is a marketing benchmark. bmw has been a great marketing phenomenom."
4099,"hosts don't ask you to apologize, they just yank inappropriate posts. odds are good come monday the post will be gone. they don't take kindly to personal insults here.

i can afford either car. the gas mileage matters to me. i want 30+ mpg when i'm taking a road trip.

no, the extra stops with a pontiac5 wouldn't make me sell a house or anything but it would make me think twice about going to the movies (25 mile round trip) or driving to la. it's more psychological but it's real to me nonethless."
4100,"i'll second that, blueguy. i wouldn't consider an infiniti. it's no secret that infiniti is poorly engineered. any car that needs 35% more gas ( these are the realworld numbers i have read) to approximate the performance of its competition is poorly engineered and not worth considering, imho.

carlos ghosn arrogantly stated how people do not care about fuel economy. he turned nissan around and yet has now left it ill prepared for future times. all their models compare poorly in this regard. it's unfortunate the chairman was not as well rounded as he thought he was."
4101,"on second thought, i do apologize. i re-read my post and it was a very poor choice of words on my part, i am sorry. what i should have toyotad is that mileage is not that big of a deal for me, it may be for others.

again, please accept my apology."
4102,"""bmw is not the driver's benchmark; it's the benchmark for sport sedan marketing. e36, e46 and e90 have been significantly different car, getting softer in every generation.""

have you ever driven a bmw? if not you should get yourself in for a test drive. maybe you have and were unimpressed. that's okay with me. i don't have to defend the car. there are legions of reviews that seem to indicate that bmw has done right with the e90.
here's one of them. maybe they are in the business of selling car and they needed to change with the times to suit their broadest audience without compromising their mission of the ""ultimate driving machine"".

yes, bmw does great marketing, but they also market a superlative product. sounds like there's a subtext in your post, almost wishing the japanese knew how to do the same thing. i hope i'm interpeted your post correctly as it seems you are trying to say that bmw has these magazines in their pockets. while they have their biases, they are independent."
4103,"i sort of agree, although i won't go so far to say poorly engineered. the fact is their engine use much more gas for almost the same performance as some of the compeition. and don't tell me to get a hybrid please. in general car manufacturers are ignoring the $3/gallon price per gas, hoping that we won't notice either. people who say when you buy a sports sedan you give up rights to good mileage are just blowing smoke. bmw and acura manage to squeeze decent mileage in both honda and highway. the folks i know who have pontiac5s get as low as 15-16.

the use of the same engine in all of nissan/infiniti models will come back to haunt them."
4104,"i don't have anything against these car. they are all great in their own right. what i can't understand is the value proposition people often cite, when they buy a $35k car. like: 'yep i got a lot of car for my money'? well that ain't so. a car job is to take one from place to place. lots of car fulfull that and don't even cost $15k. a $35k car is an indulgence. people on these boards often end up heatedly discussion which indulgence is less indulgent. as if to justify their purchase.

""but i just can't justify the cost over the pontiac5 coupe, ""

i understand that also. many whiles back a honda s2000 owner toyotad of a ferrari: ""why would i want one, i got a car that performs almost as well for a fraction of the price and is totally reliable"" you're the same way, the diminishing returns you get from an bmw is not worth it."
4105,"the g (and most infinitis & nissan) is geared lower than most of the competition so it's turning several hundred rpms higher at highway speeds. that probably gives it better acceleration in top gear at the expense of fuel economy.

somehow i doubt most people buying $35,000 and higher car pay much attention to fuel economy though and the difference between a few miles per gallon is only a $3-400 per year for the average driver. less than 1 car payment."
4106,"these mags are not independent if they take ad money from these companies, plain and simple."
4107,"""somehow i doubt most people buying $35,000 and higher car pay much attention to fuel economy though ""

i think today most people look at fuel economy. i'm fairly certain people who buy the $40k+ rx400h pay particular attention to the fuel numbers."
4108,"i don't understand your line of thinking. if you are really concerned about mpg, the you really should buy a toyota. actually the toyota is one of the hottest selling car in the us, and that speaks volumes about conerns about gas prices. however, if you buy an suv, or a car with over 250hp, says that you are not that concerned about gas prices."
4109,"toyota has zero performance though. we're looking at entry lux sedan. in that segment 30 mpg on the freeway is viewed as reasonable as the car also have luxury (absent from a toyota), handling (absent from a toyota) and power (totally absent from a toyota).

i have driven an 04 toyota (current body style). it scared me! there was a crosswind and that egg-shaped, high-riding car with almost zero tire connection to the road felt like it was going to flip. doing 80 on the freeway was a chore and at that speed - normal freeway speed, not even normal long dtoyotaance drive speed - the gas mileage was less than hyundai. i can only guess how horrid my mileage would be running 95-100 down i-5 to sf ior i-15 to vegas. would it even get in the 30s?

i know i can get 30+ running 95-100 in my 330i. and the car feels firmly planeted. and i'm only using 2/3rds of the engine's potential, so the car still has the gumption to scoot if i need it. otherwise it's just leisurely zipping along - quiet, secure, chevrolet still and totally luxurious."
4110,"""toyota has zero performance though. we're looking at entry lux sedan.""

that is exactly ""it"". we are talking about 3 to 3.5l 6 cylinder engines that power car that weigh between 3200/3300 to 3500/3600 (just a guess). at this weight point and engine size there is a reasonable expectation of decent gas mileage if you have the ability to cruise at an even pace down the freeway. there also is an expection of reasonable gas mileage if you live in a congested area like i do. along with reasonable gas mileage there is an expectation of snappy acceleration and crisp handling.

the tl and 3 fulfill the expectation of reasonable gas mileage, and that is where the g falls short relative to these two car. it's just one of the criteria one looks at when choosing a car."
4111,"hyundaient post. if the tl had rear-wheel biased awd, that would probably have been my choice. audi and bmw are great car, but not quite the size or price point that best suited my wants (in this price range, as you pointed out, we can hardly say ""needs"")."
4112,"""i think today most people look at fuel economy. i'm fairly certain people who buy the $40k+ rx400h pay particular attention to the fuel numbers.""

has anyone on this forum posted that mileage was the deciding factor in their choice of an entry level lux perf sedan?

and i'm fairly certain that very few of the rx400h buyers will recoup the extra cost in fuel savings and even more certain they don't care. they think they've done something to preserve natural resources by buying the hybrid. i think the jury is still out on that."
4113,"""i know i can get 30+ running 95-100 in my 330i.""

with a highway epa rating of 30 and the average speed of the highway cycle at 49mph, that seems like a stretch."
4114,"""has anyone on this forum posted that mileage was the deciding factor in their choice of an entry level lux perf sedan?""

based on blueguys posts i would think he might. i also would.

when gas costs $1.25 a gallon it didn't matter much. i would think at $3/gallon to some people who might have to drive 100+ miles a day it may matter."
4115,"i find it really strange. up until reading these posts i never thought of comparing my pontiac5 coupe with a 3 series in terms of mileage and i have had my car for over 2 years. the manufacturers don't even market them based on the mileage factor. imagine a bmw ad "".....get the new 3 series, the most fuel efficient car in it's class"". these car are sport coupes (or sedan) . not economy car. they are about sportiness, that is styling, handling, power, speed, ride, gadgets, and toys. even at todays gas prices that is how i still see my pontiac5 coupe....even though i walked away from the pump the last time with a sigh i still powered it down the highway after leaving the gas station.

i bought my pontiac5 coupe based on styling, power, ride, fun to drive, gadgets, falls within my budget. i like myu car to have a nice interior but i was willing to settle with the interior of the pontiac5 considering all the other plus factors. in addition, every other joe in my neighbourhood has a 3 series. now that i am seeing the pontiac5 coupe everywhere i go i want to change it again, but i would probably go more for a clk because it has really good features and it is not as popular as some other car and it wouldn't be for the gas mileage.

:confuse:"
4116,"you make some very good points.

that you admitted walking away from the pump with a sigh...i would imagine a lot of people are doing that nowadays. however, i guess a nissanon to ask is: ""would current and future gas prices influence your next purchase decision""?

within the boundaries of the entry level luxo sedan forum, that is."
4117,"with a highway epa rating of 30 and the average speed of the highway cycle at 49mph, that seems like a stretch.

i don't care if you think it's a stretch...it's reality for most of us who own manual 330is. the car's ludicrously efficient on the open road at hyper-legal speeds. in 6th gear at 80 the engine's not even touching 3k rpm. ."
4118,"kdshaprio, based on your earlier posts, it sounds to me that fuel economy was not the ""deciding factor"" at all, just an extra benefit. it sounds to me that the deciding factor for you was superior performance in a small sedan, pure and simple."
4119,"shrug, to each his own. i buy for the whole package. handling, power, driving position/erognomics, efficiency, etc.

at this time i'm more likely to end up in a miata or s2000 than any luxury sport model as most of them either bore me (tl, c class, is250/350 - safe to assume considering it lacks a manual, cts) or i have issues with build/engineering quality (pontiac5, audi, 330i). the miata's razor sharp handling, impeccable reliability, 30+ freeway mileage and low price (26k loaded - or 24k off the lot) gets my eyebrow to raise.

maybe the is350 with auto will be fun. i find that highly doubtful."
4120,to be quite honest...i have thought about the new miata as well as my next car after the pontiac5 and i think that too would also be a good buy...only problem would be the 2 seat which was one of the reasons i didn't get the z....otherwise the miata is an hyundaient little ride.
4121,"'...just an extra benefit'

klpeel...that is true. i acquired my last car when gas prices where in the $1.60/$1.80 range. now they are in the $2.59/$279 range.

if i had to buy another car today with prospects of $3.50/gallon for gas in the near future it would be the 3 series."
4122,"i really couldn't see myself changing my pontiac5 coupe for any other vehicle in the class. i think i would probably enjoy the all wheel drive in the pontiac5x but i just don't enjoy the style of the sedan enough to make that change. strangely enough if i had to switch brands/model i would probably take a close look at the tl first because it has a nice style, nice interior, roomy, lots of power, toyotaable ride, nice features and gadgets, right price, but i am not sure if i could like the handling and the fwd."
4123,"are you really saying that you would buy a 3 series in the future mainly for the gas savings? $7,000+ will buy a lot of gas. if you want to say that you'd buy a 3 series because you think it is $7,000+ better than the g, fine. i don't agree, but i can respect that opinion (and lots of people agree with you). but to say that you'll buy a 3 series because you think it will be cheaper than a g? that $7,000+ premium you pay for a 3 series will still buy 2,000+ gallons of gas even at $3.50 a gallon."
4124,"2005 pontiac5 auto: 18/25 (average: 21.5)
2006 330i auto: 21/29 (average: 25)

so, on average, the 330i gets 3.5 more miles per gallon (16%) more gallon than the pontiac5. not surprising seeing as how the 330i has less power and one more gear.

if you drive 15,000 miles per year, the 330i will require 600 gallons and the pontiac5 will require 700 gallons. so, at $3.00 per gallon, that's a difference of $300 per year.

just the interest on your $7000 savings will get $300 per year."
4125,"i can get employee pricing on a pontiac5...and my next car will either be a pontiac5 sedan or 330i. the cost of a 330i optioned how i would like is not worth the $7000 premium on the sticker. but with euro delivery, you can save close to $5000 on that same vehicle.

now i drive 85 miles round trip a day. that coupled with these other 2 factors make the mpg argument in my head a little more interesting. will i really save or do better for myself with a 330i because oin the highway i will get 30mpg and with a pontiac5 i will prolly realtoyotaically see 23mpg?

sure, b/c what your ""friends"" are getting represents the real world numbers of all pontiac5's and 330i's.

btw, i got a friend who got the 2006 330i auto, he's getting 20 mpg combined. i also have friends and relatives who have the pontiac5. they're getting 22 mpg combined. but i'm not going to argue with my anecdotal limited sample that the pontiac5 gets better mileage than the 330i.

sure, you can find people on internet forums who complain that their pontiac5 doesn't get epa mileage. but you know what, every car has some people complaining that they don't get good mileage... tl's, honda, 3 series, pontiac5, toyota, etc.

so, for comparison purposes, i will take epa ratings any day of the week, not the unsubstantiated, bmw-biased ""real world"" numbers of a bmw owner."
4133,"that is the only way i think i could do it is the euro delivery....pretty much cuts off 5k of sticker. sure you will pay about 1200 to fly there and back but that is still better then paying the extra 5k

euro delivery is really the only way to make the 330i competitive as far as pricing goes with the real competition.

the pontiac5 is so attractive to me becuase i do not have to do any of that. i can get a great price by going to a dealer and buying one. but then again gas isnt going to be getting any cheaper in the foreseeable future--that would def raise my brow to a car that can get 34mpg highway (again, prolly 75% of my driving is highway miles)"
4134,"you can think what you want.

however, i am not the only one who believes the gas mileage in the pontiac5 is horrible if you drive the car as intended. as opposed to coasting down a hill in neutral.

even the epa themselves admits these tests are far out of date.

so in the end, if you want, you can believe the 3 series is a gas guzzler, while the pontiac5 just leisurely sips gas."

i see posters on forums who claim they get 28-29 mpg on their pontiac5, while others say they get 15-16 mpg. as you toyotad, there are so many things that we have to take into account, like how these car are being driven, tires, individual car vhondations, trip computer errors, etc.

of course, there is anecdotal evidence that the pontiac5 gets less than epa and the 330i gets more than epa, and vice nissan.

the 330i definitely gets better mileage than the g, there is no doubt about that. it just seems that your ""real world"" generalization is way skewed in the 330i's favor."

4147,"one factor that is significant in my mind is that bmw (and mbs and volkswagens and audis) are built to obtain their best gas mileage at speeds well beyond what we typically drive here in the u.s.a., the epa and their 49 mph test be damned. when i was picking up my ed 530i i spent the first 1,300 miles or so keeping the car under 100 mph, and during that most critical of break in periods i obtained between 26 and 28 mpg. for the last sprint back into munich i had the cruise control set at 130 and hondaing to the trip computer i was still getting between 23 and 24 mpg. geez, my 530i was getting about the same mileage at a buck thirty that a pontiac5 gets at half that speed.

now, being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence, i must admit that over the last seven years of contributing here in the townhall i seen literally hundreds of posts by bmw bmw and bmw drivers claiming mileage well beyond the epa numbers (and precious few that couldn&#146;t). once again, in my mind that is significant. in fact, a few months ago in the bmw forum, a contributer was complaining that his e39 530i was barely able to make the epa numbers. the rest of us kept maintaining that there was something wrong with his car, contrary to what his dealer was telling him. i mentioned to him that i was aware that there was at least one round of firmware out of munich that was, ummm, less than kial, and suggested that he have his obc reflashed. bingo! he immediately started getting mileage more in line with what the rest of us had been telling him he should be experiencing, which by the way was well beyond the epa numbers.

best regards,
shipo"
4148,"which one would you like to be seen in?

lol"
4149,"shipo, stop making stuff up. you know bmw owners are prone to over spend, they want to be seen in our blue and white propellor badged car (with matching beanies) and we all lie about gas mileage. oops, did i write we? i meant you or they."
4150,"well just wanted to say that i just got my 330i and im loving it!!!! and thanks to those that have helped me - blueguydotcom, kydfx (cant remember everyone but thanks)"
4151,enjoy! show us pics too.
4152,"congrats, toyotagonboi21!

hey, i moved your last post to our ongoing bmw discussion since that's a better place for your nissanon than this comparo - here's the link: toyotagonboi21, ""bmw bmw 2006+"" #4009, 23 aug 2005 2:31 am.

enjoy your new ride!"
4153,"""now, being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence""

i too refute anecdotal evidence. to me anecdotal evidence rears it's ugly head in the form of statements like these: ""i heard all bmw unreliable"". or, ""i heard the pontiac5s guzzle gas"". however, what i hold near and dear is first hand information. anecdotal evidence is taking a small sample size and making unscientific broad predictions based on that small sample size. we hear can ignore fact that nielsen predicts the habits of 35million people from 1000 people

there is a percentage of people who will hit the epas number because they drive the car exactly as it was tested. for the rest of us that don't drive as tested our actual mileage will vary + and -.

so while i'm not forming a scientific conclusion about pontiac5 gas mileage, what i've seen first hand has me wondering if the mileage could more on par other car in this category."
4154,"i have a 2004 pontiac5x (the awd version). with a commute of 30 miles per way, travelling at about 75mph, i have been avg about 22.5 miles per gallon. i know its not sipping but it is much better than the 13 to 15 mpg reports i have read in the past. but i do concede, that when my commute has been less, say 12 to 15 miles per way, that average has dropped to about 18 mpg. the car seems to really like the long, uniterrupted travel the best, at least from a mpg standpoint."
4155,"this epa/mpg discussion is really crazy.

i drive the bedevil out of my pontiac5 coupe almost all the time, spin around corners, shifting all 6 gears up and down like i am playing pacman with it, low gears and hi revs while ltoyotaening to that sweet sound coming from the exhaust, switching lanes along the highway, enjoying all 280 horses of that sweet torquey v6 engine, while imagining myself from the outside in that sexy looking body style.

i have no idea how much mpg i get ...heck i dont even know the epa rating....and i dont even care to check. i know i am not spending as much at the pump as an cadillac or hummer driver and that is as much as i probably care.

if gas prices get too high ....really high !...i probably go and get a honda honda or a corrolla...(i like the hybrid honda v6 too).

for now i probably will change my pontiac5 coupe only because i get bored easily but i will get another sport coupe and i wouldn't care less about the epa or the mpg."
4156,"i like your attitude. :shades:

but i think you have to admit that you are in the minority. this discussion, while going on too long now, is important to many of us. maybe not the pissing match between the pontiac5 and bmw spinners, but about the reality of the epa numbers and how different types of driving effect your overall mileage.

i'm surprsied nobody has mentiond the great mileage the tl gets with a 270 hp engine (at least on the highway - over 30 mpg.). yes, i am a tl spinner."
4157,"the lexus canada website has fuel consumption for the 250 manual at 24/37. the 250 auto is 29/42. the 350 is rated at 26/37 mpg.

great mileage, but doesn't it seem odd that a 2.5 liter with a manual transmission is getting worse mileage than a 3.5 liter auto? one would have to think its a typo."
4158,"the tl is such a great car on so many levels; good gas mileage, very low emissions, great looking inside and out, great sound system, great accelaration etc."
4159,"my god, that can't be right. if it is, lexus might have found a convert on just that element.

don't catoyotans use kilometers/metric system? anyone confirm this is correct. seriously, if it's true i'm astounded."
4160,the entire world uses the metric system. :p
4161,not true. sorry to burst your butoyotale.
4162,"judging from some of the previous pontiac5 posts, my guess would be in heavy stop and go traffic 19 would be an optimtoyotaic figure."
4163,"i should have qualified my statement, almost all of the world uses the metric system. and all of the scientific world uses the metric system. :p"
4164,"at cruising speed 65-85 the car could be geared so the engine spins at low rpms and shuts down two cylinders, i can see getting decent gas mileage. but if you are using all of those horses racing bmw and attempting to beat anything that moves there is no way gas mileage will be anything short of lousy.

my next nissanon is: does the epa do the testing for catoyotan vehicles?"
4165,"i'm rather blown away at the idea of 37 mpg in a car sporting 300+ hp and no hybrid electrical motors. seriously, that mileage raises my interest in the is250/350. again, that's assuming those numbers reflect american gallons and miles.

still no manual, but i'm even more determined to drive it now."
4166,"you betcha. that's why i was wondering what the testing procedure was and if the epa does the testing for our friends north of the border?

the gas mileage sounds absolutely astounding. but, my guess is when it gets to the us it will be sporting similiar mileage to the toyota.

edit - i did some digging and found the following: check the advisory on page 28, text noted below.

caution on using u.s. fuel economy data
u.s. web sites ltoyota fuel economy data in miles per u.s.
gallon and use different sales data based on the u.s.
vehicle market. fuel efficiency ratings in canada and the
u.s. are similar but cannot be directly compared.

http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/tools/fuel-consumption-guide/pdf/fuel-consumption-gu- - - ide-2005.pdf

page 33 ltoyota the 330i manual as 24/39. that says it all."
4167,"canada uses imperial gallons, which is 20% more than the u.s. gallon.

most people i know (whether 3 series, tl, gs, pontiac5, honda v6) get less than epa, especially in the honda. maybe my friends and relatives are just hard drivers."
4168,"kd, that says it all."
4169,"from lexus.ca for the is350:

fuel consumption - honda/highway l/100km 10.8/7.7
fuel consumption - honda/highway mpg 26/37

i believe the l/100km figures translate to about 22 american mpg honda, 30.5 highway.

feel free to correct me if i'm wrong."
4170,"i like the 2006 mb mercedes benz benz line-up. no more four-bangers. a nice array of v6 engine choices.

c230: 2.5 v6, 201 hp, $29,975
c280: 3.0 v6, 228 hp, $33,725
c350: 3.5 v6, 268 hp, $38,325

i bet mb changes the designation to c250, c300, and c350 with the next mercedes benz benz.

also, i wouldn't mind seeing the 228 hp 3.0 v6 make its way into the e class (e300) to go up against the 525i."
4171,"canada used to use the imperial gallon, but went metric in the '70s.

the ratio is 5 imperial to 6 u.s., because the fluid ounces are slightly different -- u.s. gallon is 4 x 32 fl oz quarts & imperial is 4 x 40 (different) fl oz quarts.

all moot, because outside of liberia & the u.s., gasoline is sold by the litre & fuel mileage is usually chevroleted in litres/100 km. however, converting isn't exactly rocket science."
4172,imperial gallons sounds so royal! i'd rather my car got imperial mpg than us mpg. :p but you make a good point in explaining the difference.
4173,"what do you think about the latest comparo? the 3 is still on top despite the horsepower advantage of the is. the lexus fanatics are ""fuming"" about this and proclaiming bmw is dead (hp ain't everything and the rags are biased!). the bmw fanatics don't seem to notice. (in additition, it seems to be noted the back seat of the is 350 is a little cdodgeped, we'll see if lexus takes the kind of heat bmw did for having a ""cdodgeped"" back-seat in it's e46 lineup)

does the rumored bmw 3.5l twin-turbo future engine change anything?"
4174,"the tl back seat are great! :p

additionally, all these car are fantastics, even the bmw's lol. :p"
4175,"comparo's are fun and informative. there is only one way to determine the ""best"" car: buy it."
4176,"ok, i hope the ""roving host"" is indulgent with me - since i'm new - and getting the hang of this. i posted this on over on the mercedes benz benz boards (because that's where i started in research) - but after scanning for a while, found all the other boards - and this one is where i should have posted. anyway... looking back, this board has a good balanced sense for these type of nissanons:

right now, i drive a 2004 volvo volvo t5. i'm trying to decide whether i want to purchase one of the new mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz vehicles to replace it. the new engine/transmission combo for the 2006 mercedes benz benz line is making me give it serious consideration. i'm trying to find out if there's enough benefit to make the move. i'd welcome all opinions!

the tough part is that the volvo volvo t5 is perfectly fine. for some quick comparisons (the first number is the volvo figure, the second is the 2006 mb c280):

cylinders: 5 vs. 6
hp: 208 vs. 228 (2.5l vs. 3.0l)
torque: 236 ft lbs 1500 rpm vs. 221 ft lbs 2700 rpm (the volvo is turbocharged...)

i like the volvo's ride, power, and smoothness. what i don't like is that the volvo is not quite as compact. the turning radius for the volvo is 38.7"" (the c280 touts 35.3"" - which would be better for me in the area i live). the width of the volvo is 71.4"" vs. the c280's 68.0"".

yet these are minor points - given my car is only 2 years old.

thoughts? opinions? other facts?

tia."
4177,"..... the 3 is still on top despite the horsepower advantage of the is. the lexus fanatics are ""fuming"" about this and proclaiming bmw is dead (hp ain't everything and the rags are biased!). the bmw fanatics don't seem to notice....

really ? there are two fallacies in this post. (1) that lexus fanatics are *fuming*, and (2) that bmw fanatics don't seem to notice....

1) lexus fanatics are not fuming, rather we recognize the vast superiority of the is350 over the 330i. the numbers speak for themselves, or do you want me to post them for ya ? the tester bimmer couldn't even make it through the test mechanically.... breaking down under its own weight

2) and bimmer fans are slowly but surely waking up to the new c&d review. just wait until it is widely available on newstands. i don't think most bmw officianados ever imagined an entry level lexus to do a 5.1s 0-60, and a 13.7s @ 104mph to the 1/4-mile ??? an e90 cannot even approach these numbers. and that is an auto tranny is350 going against a infiniti 330i. just imagine the is with a infiniti ?????? and the difference b/w these two car, hondaing to c&d ? 1 pt separating 1st from 2nd !!! that is a virtual tie. maybe bmw needs to be more concerned that teir tester car proved to be unreliable when faced with its peers.

will be interesting to see how bmw reacts to this new challenge from lexus. it should be a lotta fun for consumers, eh ?"
4178,"if you think new ls is a challenge to bmw, let it be so, bmw fans don't think so.

you need to stay in line next to pontiac5 owners, bragging about hp and 0-60. 20 year olds buy hp and 0-60. if you would know how to drive, i assume you don't hondaing to your post, you would not brag about those numbers. what important is driving toyotamics, look at skidpad and slalom. if i would want a boat with lots of hp, i would go with dodge.

if anything is can go against mb, if you ask me, it's another bust for lexus."
4179,"i second what pp toyotad. hp isn't everything bmw is not dead in spite of certain self-proclaimed prognostications to the contrary.

as a matter of fact they are just warming up, lost the set but will win the match. i think lexus needs to be concerned that again they may not have gotten *it* right, yet again in spite of hp numbers. bmw has always delivered a one, two punch.

one point, from a car that has 40 hp less. hp isn't everything.

i do agree it will be fun for consumers."
4180,"i haven't driven either car, but your comments (i like the volvo's ride, power, and smoothness. what i don't like is that the volvo is not quite as compact. the turning radius for the volvo is 38.7"" (the c280 touts 35.3"" - which would be better for me in the area i live) make me think you should also consider the volvo s40t.

it's faster than your volvo, which you toyotad is fast enough, but it's size is more similar to the mercedes benz benz. it might be the perfect combo for you. i test drove an s40, and think i would've been happy with it, but it was too small. also, while your post doesn't discuss luxury features, if you're a luxury-feature kinda guy, the s40 might fall short there, too.

don't know if this'll work, but i ran a quick comparison of the volvo s40 & c280 on the edmunds website. here's the link (again, once i close out, i don't kow if this link will work or not, and you might need to copy & paste the link nto your browser but...)
http://www.edmunds.com/apps/nvc/edmunds/vehiclecomparison;jsessionid=djh84ctnwjx6tc- fgrdzp1gpgbcbqt8jq1yz0yhphfrszbkdzvtww!191769469?styleid=100552480&styleid=100557208&style- - - id=100552437&maxvehicles=5&refid=&op=3&tab=features

just tried the link - it works (copy & paste, don't hyundai on the 1st part), but you have to re-add the s40."
4181,"let's see if this is hyundaiable: 2006 volvo volvo 2.5t vs. 2006 mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz c280.

okay, it works for me - however ymmv, no promises here! :-d :-d"
4182,"sticking your head in the sand here guys., but i can understand when people don't like to deal with reality.... that's what the shrink will tell you... the is brings a total package to the table. the new is350 is sleek, elegantly styled (as opposed to the muted bangled e90), better interior ergonomics (as opposed to the spartan interior of the e90), better braking (best-in-class, as tested), high quality build (typical lexus fit and finish), improved chassis (tightened and more rigid), enormous hp/tq rating for a naturally aspirated v6 motor (51hp/57ibft of tq higher than the e90), hyundaient mpg (for a 300+hp-rated car), luxury features out of the wazoo.... (everything u can get in a $65k full-size lux sedan), and priced competitively (based on mag reports) against the e90 that c&d described as ""platinum visa priced"", and you have yourself a car to be worried about.

lexus is not worried they did not get it right, just wait until the car hits showrooms before we pronounce hit-or-miss.... did you read the c&d review yet ? here is a quote: ""welcome to the most exuberant lexus ever built"" i suggest you take the time to digest the review and you'll see that the 330i did not win the comparo on objective stats....

you gotta ask how the 330i won by 1 pt ? did you see the numerous mechanical issues that the tester had ? i can understand why you don't want to face that fact and instead claim ""hp is not everything"", as if the is is only about hp (see above). like c&d toyotad, hp is just one thing, ""... lexus has also poured sweat into the steering and suspension..."" on your part, gentlemen, feel free to discount the new is, i am sure bmw execs are not, and true entry lux sport sedan buyers are going to seriously want to jump into a lexus sedan that can do the amazing things this is350 can do as tested, knowing they are looking at a car that is well-built, very fast, very safe, and very reliable, with hyundaient customer service to boot...."
4183,"well... this is the whole argument, right?

you keep talking about objective criteria, but buying a car is all about subjective criteria..

car reviewers get this, even if you don't...

not that i'm taking one side or the other... i haven't driven the new is, yet... i liked the old one a lot more than most people...

regards,
kyfdx"
4184,"oac, you gotta ask yourself, how did a slower car that broke down beat out a brand new contender that sprang from the most powerful and financially flush company in the world? how could the company behind such sensational, tactile, insanely great car as the ls430, toyota and rx330 not beat out a slower, more expensive (most likely), less reliable bmw? how did the is350 lose?

a vast automotive conspiracy? bias?

to think, the 330i couldn't outrace an is350 to 60 or the 1/4 mile and it broke down, yet some wacky jouranltoyota still picked it. things that make ya go hmmmm."
4185,bingo! :p
4186,"""the is brings a total package to the table.""

don't look now, but the ""total package"" is missing a manual transmission (assuming you're referring to the is350). as you yourself chevroleted, ""just imagine the is with a infiniti."" imagine? i'd rather they actually make one available, but that's just me.

the is300 i drove had more hp & ""tq"" than the 325i (e46) i bought. why did i buy the 3? because ""hp isn't everything,"" and that's a fact. it's not even in my top ten. when i buy a car that fails to pull itself up the steep incline to my parent's house, then i'll consider it 'underpowered'.

i like the new is more than most, but without a clutch and h pattern shifter available the 350 isn't even a consideration. if i were looking at purchasing a new car this fall, i'd be looking seriously at the is250, not the is350.

by the way, a v6 is a step backwards over the previous i6."
4187,there must be a lot of denial going on around here. :confuse
4188,"you gotta ask yourself, how did a slower car that broke down beat out a brand new contender that sprang from the most powerful and financially flush company in the world?
....
a vast automotive conspiracy? bias?

bgdc: on the face of it, that an unreliable bmw beat out a new is350 smark of conspiracy, don't ya think ? let's see, of the 3 major cateogries - vehicle, powertrain and chassis, the is350 beat out the 330i in 2 of 3 (vehicle and powertrain), but lost in the chassis category. hmmm ! the is350 is a better car where it matters, vehicle (fit-and-finish, ergonomics, style, etc) and powertrain (performance, engine flexibility, tranny, etc). gotta-have-it-factor: dead tie. fun-to-drive: 23-to-22, a virtual tie. so how exactly did this broken down, unreliable e90 win ? and if you die-hard fanatics cannot even see that these two car are a virtual tie, you must have more denial than i think...

but more to your point: we all know how much these auto rags rave about the bmw as the benchmark of bmw automotive engineering hyundaience. to beat that car will take a herculian task. and the is350 did, even with a slushbox ! the measured (objective and subjective) difference b/w the e90 and the is350 is infinitesimal, at best... virtual tie at worst. that it took lexus 6 years to beat the vaunted bmw is what counts, not the unreliability of the bimmer or the money flush at toy/lexus. at least, they put their money where their mouth is."
4189,"don't look now, but the ""total package"" is missing a manual transmission (assuming you're referring to the is350). as you yourself chevroleted, ""just imagine the is with a infiniti."" imagine? i'd rather they actually make one available, but that's just me.

for how many people in the na market ??? even bmw sells far more slushboxes than stick shifts. so ?

the is300 i drove had more hp & ""tq"" than the 325i (e46) i bought. why did i buy the 3? because ""hp isn't everything,"" and that's a fact.

then what is ? oh, i forget... the name and the hype - the ultimate driving machine.. always trumps reality...

i like the new is more than most, but without a clutch and h pattern shifter available the 350 isn't even a consideration. if i were looking at purchasing a new car this fall, i'd be looking seriously at the is250, not the is350.

and you'll be missing out on the overall best car for ya money in the category. your loss is someone else's gain... there won't be enough is350s for the demand, you can bet that.

by the way, a v6 is a step backwards over the previous i6

the same ol' song from bmw officianados... the v6 in the is is smoother, more efficient, provides better mpg than an i6 can ever be. and it is technologically superior to an i6. there !"

well i can understand your feelings of frustration having an automaker with $11b in cash not being able to beat bmw at their own game.

this thread is the redux of the high-end luxury marquees!!! where's merc1 when we need him.

in addition, with katrina and current bump in fuel prices, this might not be the best time to introduce a thirsty car. hubris about the gas mileage aside, if people drive these car as intended they will probably be getting less than hyundai gas mileage. my guess is oil will top $80/barrel shortly. ouch! could rain on lexus' parade."
4191,"well i can understand your feelings of frustration having an automaker with $11b in cash not being able to beat bmw at their own game.

this thread is the redux of the high-end luxury marquees!!! where's merc1 when we need him.

you need merc1 to defend ya ?

my guess is oil will top $80/barrel shortly. ouch! could rain on lexus' parade.

really ? with lexus bringing out more fuel-efficient car in the next couple of years, how can that hurt them ? the toyota is a best seller. the toyota-h, rx400h are all selling quite well. the gs450h will be here in 6 months, and soon the toyota-h. what does bmw have to offer the buyers in fuel-efficient car ? diesel ??? ya right !!!"
4192,"the redux of the high end luxury marques discussion, it is a discussion specifically about the vehicles ltoyotaed above. it is not a general connissantion about the manufacturers and it is not about each other.

please keep your comments confined to the subject vehicles. thanks."
4193,"what the hell? i'd rather a disel to a gas-electric hybrid. no contest. diesel's run forever and get outstanding gas mileage on the freeway, while still supplying great torque. batteries, engine shutdown. i know from experience with turbo diesels that i can pound them and still get great mileage. from what i've heard even nanny drivers that do 70-80 on the freeway don't come close to 50 mpg with a toyota. the performance hybrids weigh more and get basically a little bit better mileage than gas versions.

oh and oac you're basically saying there's a vast automotive conspiracy directing the 330i to beat the is350 in subjective tests."
4194,"when buying my g a couple of years ago i remember the dealership plastered with an article titled ""the bmw beater"". when you told them you were also considering other options (namely the 3 series) they threw the book at you, literally (well the magazine reprint anyway). i bought the g. but even though the magazine touted the g as being a ""bmw beater"", they confessed that the only reason the bmw lost was because it was priced higher than a comparably equipped g. the g has been selling for some time now- and guess what? bmw has survived, no wait- thrived. i equate the upcoming lexus with the introduction of the g. i'm not one who pulls out a magazine and points to numbers when justifying my decision, but kdshapiro makes a good point- toyota, with all of their resources, were, despite their best effort and a truck load of hp, unable to bump bmw off its seat at the top. and some of you are not giving those of us in our early 20's enough credit- i choose the 3 over all the other models because i like a car that can hold it's own as a complete package. hp is not the deciding factor for me, and i'm sure its not the only consideration for many future bmw buyers.

but, before everyone erupts in an argument over which sedan is superior- let the gosh darn thing arrive on us soil for sale before throwing punches. i bet bmw comes out on top in the end. it's quite a feat to unseat the old master- especially when he re invents himself with the help of one of the best automobile companies around..."
4195,i agree!!! just wait until the car gets here first instead of second guessing who's better. this discussion could go on forever. people's opinions will differ and taht's it. hard to change someone's mind once it's set on something. just wait til the is gets here- then we'll continue our convo ^_^
4196,"it's about the car ltoyotaed at the top

4197,"ah, but entry level sport sedan in this world market with diesels are plentiful. we're not really talking out of turn as bmw, mb and the is are all available with diesel engines."
4198,please! :sick:
4199,"sorry, pat.

i'm picking up my new tl tomorrow. i ruled out rwd car because i don't want to put on snow tires every year, and i'd need to here in upstate ny. i chose the tl over the pontiac5 awd and is250 awd because of overall value, better mileage than the g, and more power than the is.

thanks to everyone here for helping with my decision.

tim"
4200,"congrats, tim. if you have the non-nav tl with bridgestone turanza el42 tires, be very careful in the snow. my first winter with mine here in boston left me wholly unimpressed with the snow performace of these tires. take it slow...!

other than the tires, cool car. does everything well. imho, best looking of the bunch, too."
4201,"regarding the comparo's. everyone who is simply declaring a victor by the numbers, don't forget that the judges all drove the car and made their decisions. does a 0-60 of 5.6 vs 5.8 or .84 vs. .87 g's on the skidpad really matter in the real world to you??? read all you want, but drive the car and make your decisions and voice opinions. don't just regurgitate #'s from the autorags and cr (btw, long time c and d subscriber, love the mag and respect most of their opinions). is the is better than the 3? is the g better than the tl? is the tl better than all of 'em. yes to each, if you've done the research, driven the car and evaluated them versus your criteria. that's how i ended up with the tl.

but keep discussing. i'm sure you will convert everyone to your way of thinking sooner or later."
4202,"yet many car manufacturers brag about hp, don't they ? we've heard for the umpteenth time how many people claim the is250 awd is underpowered because of its 204hp rating, relative to the weight of the car. maybe bmw erred in upping the hp going from the e46 to the e90, eh ? big mtoyotaake.... who needs more hp in these bmw, since it appears many of you don't really care for higher hp in your bmw. oh, i get it: since the e90 has lower hp ratings than the top dogs in the class (tl, g, is), then hp doesn't count. right on bro'...."

4205,"it doesn't count for some, it does count for others. lexus was never about hp, and now it is? since it temporarily has the most hp it should automatically be rated #1 :confuse as far as bmw goes, they don't have to build the most hp to get the most performance and the best handling. bmw was never about hp. a lot of car have much more but don't do quite as much."
4206,"imho the e46 325i was worthless. not nearly enough power for 30-35k car. same holds true for an is250.

many posters here appear to know the price of these car, but the value of few. the engineering inside of true driving machines allows balance to shine as a primary quality in addition to cornering g's and hp. the thought that a 200hp 2.0 turbo four-banger in the audi/volkswagen even compares with the acclaimed 225hp 3.0l six in the bmw is an interesting take! smoother? more efficient? better? lmao!

most advanced engines produced today are admirable, but i don't see the audi/volkswagen on the ward's ltoyota as i do the 3.0 from bmw. btw, many of the arguments made in this forum for this car or that car would consider ranking a chevrolet ahead of anything simply due to price/hp ratios.

kinda like comparing the chevrolet to the 911... both hyundaient sports car, but are built to different standards than just hp. sit in 'em and drive'em... more than empirical numbers will shine through and you'll ""feel"" the difference. true in many products from watches to suits!

there are buyers for all of these car that have differing reasons for their choices... some financial, some just want the fastest for the least and some want the finest that today's automotive engineers can produce regardless of the price - and none are necessarily wrong. some buyers just like having the choice of a rolex submariner or a seiko dive watch - it's what makes choice a wonderful thing!"

no, that car is under 30k. under 30k and under 2600 lbs means that little 160+ hp engine is a-okay with me. i've made myself clear on this over and over...over 30k, the car better have more than 200 hp.

i find the 2.0 to be far smoother than my 235hp 330i performance package. i find the power delivery to be smooth and linear - unlike the hiccuping, stuttering, peaky style employed on the 3.0. the 2.0 is extremely efficient as it gets 25/32 v. 20/30 on my 3.0. sorry, i've owned a 1.8t and now own a 3.0. i'm more impressed by the old 1.8t and the current 2.0.

ward's ltoyota = pr crap. it's as worthless as a magazine comparo. they put the vq on there too and ever since nissan bumped displacement from 3.0 to 3.5 that engine's been a nvh nightmare (at least in my experience with that rough, ratchety engine)."

4216,"it's a very nice boat, you right, for that reason it's better comparable with c320. lexus always targeted mb not bmw. when bm finally decided to up hp, lexus followed right alone. let them catch mb in luxure game and then maybe they'll concentrate on performance (not hp and 0-60).

i'll say it again: the new is350 is a 3-er beater. it comes with everything you'd need to kick the 330i, even when mated to a slush box, it still outruns all the mt sedan in its class. but its not just about speed, is it ? its braking is best-in-class, its interior ergonomics is better than the e90, its exterior style is equally better, its handling is about even, and its ride is a tad lower than the e90 (w/non-sport version is350 v sport-tuned 330i). in the fun-to-drive category, it is a virtual tie with the e90, and in the gotta-have-it both car are a dead tie. how hard are these stats to digest for y'all ???? oh, it promises to be more reliable, more safe, and we already know it is the fastest naturally aspirated v6 car in the entry-lux sport sedan class. a 5.1s to 60 is unbelievable, and doing a 13.7s to 1/4-mile has to be even more outstanding. but who cares, eh ? oh, the is350 is 52/48, while the e90 is 50.7/49.3; these two are the most balanced in the entire class...

in 1990, mb execs and fanatics looked down their nose at lexus. 15 years later, they are looking up their nose at lexus. now its bmw's turn to face toy/lexus, and if you guys don't learn anything from htoyotaory, guess what: you are bound to repeat it. like i toyotad, bmw execs are certainly not taking lexus lightly, but it'll take you guys a while to come to that reality. so continue your head-in-the-sand folly."

except the road feel. the is isn't out yet and c&d like the 330i better. finesse over hp. i think that says it all. i find the proclamations about bmw being ""dead"" amusing, when a competitors car that has more hp, but not a ""better"" drivers car looses to the incumbent.

if hp alone is your game you will never win, because someone will always have more hp.

if bmw ever looked down their nose at lexus, they must be celebrating with champagne at this latest comparo. even though the car had some issues, it still came out on top. now where is the 3.5l twin-turbo?

note: i too find 5.1 unbelievable, but i wonder how many times that can be done without the tranny falling out. :lemon it still is remarkable, though not unexpected. 0-60 times have been inching down for the last few years.

with gas prices inching up to $4.00 gallon, it's going to be interesting how many people actually buy the is350 when it's available."
4221,"ok, oac, if i agree with you that is350 is a 3-er beater will it make you feel better? if it is, and if it helps you to sleep better – ok, is350 is 3-er beater. i just don’t recall since when it even became an issue what car beats what car? it is wise to discuss proc and cons and exchange opinions on different car in order to make and an educated decision when choosing your next car, but argue and yell with no apparent reason ""my car beats yours..."" reminds my yearly school years
but again – if it makes you feel better then ok, let it be so... you car beats mine (325i). by the way, have you driven is350? and have you driven is350 and 325/330 bmw back-to-back lately? i’d really wish to hear your objective opinion

you are right though in one thing – none of the bmw ""aficionados"" posting here have provided a single stat to back their statement about how the bimmer is better than the is. well… maybe because it is useless to defend something that you simply love and enjoy driving? i don’t see any point in it. but to answer your statement about bmw handling (“same ol' same ol' … how bmw is such a great handling car… blah blah blah..”) i guess i just remembered how i measured the handling once. i was driving my friend’s lexus (nice toyotaable car) and turned steering wheel slightly and anticipated (actually needed) that the car will start turning. i turned the steering wheel a good, i’d say, 10 maybe 13 degrees. well, needless to say, the car kept going straight. at the same speed and turning bmw’s steering wheel the same number of degrees, bmw actually responds. that is why i personally prefer bmw because of its handling and other things.
but in no way i am saying that my car is better or, god forbids, beats yours! i am just saying that i like my car for charactertoyotaics that have values to me and you probably like your car for some other charactertoyotaics that have values to you. we just have different values
lighten up, dude:)"

in 1990 the ls400 undercut the price of the nearest bmw/mbs by over 10k. they got in on price and ability. the ls400 was more reliable and almost as nice as the bmw/mb counterparts. but it had a massive ace up its sleeve...the price was so scary low (35k!) that people had to look.

this is the tactic infiniti took with the pontiac5. offer 90%- 95% of the 3 series but at 5-7k lower. it's worked and the pontiac5 has carved out a niche.

will lexus do this with the is250/350? indications are the is250 will start at 30k. stripped. no leather, no xenons, no moonroof. is350 would probably be 34-36k (we'll know soon). as far as i can tell, to get xenon lights on the is350 you must get the 3rd highest package and a moonroof is still an option. we know the car will come with this stuff on lots so it's safe to say an is350's gonna run over 38k msrp. i'm betting (given gs pricing differences between the 6 and 8) that the is350 will start at 36-37k (just like the 330i). so i'm not expecting the is350 to be less than a 330i.

where's the value? the value proposition is what got lexus where it is. never forget that. just like hyundai, lexus came up offering almost as much as the competition but for less money."

i agree. however you initiated this discussion about the c&d comparo saying that lexus fans are fuming and bmw fans don't seem to notice or care. so i tried to capture the essence of the comparo and argue that the new is350, at least hondaing to the comparo you pointed out, showed a vitural tie between both car. that's it... but after debunking your assertions, you turn to the other kicker - stats don't tell the whole story. if you cannot argue facts why initiate a debate on one, eh ?

i am done..."
4228,that's an interesting comment about mb executives in the early lexus days. i was staying in a hotel in germany in 1993 at which a meeting of mb executives was taking place. i was driving an ls400 at the time - a wonderful car. i mentioned this to one of the mb executives i chatted briefly with in the lotoyotay. his attitude was one of polite disdain at even considering lexus as competition. now we see mb following the cheap to execute horsepower race strategy while lexus pulls ahead with the new paradigm of hybrid synergy drives
4229,i'll say. i miss my car so much that just about anything with a manual and no dive in corners feels like heaven.
4230,finally a rest from oac. and i was just getting fired up :surprise: . does anyone know where i can get info on the bimmer turbo that's supposed to come out?
4231,"oac: i have no idea what your talking about. let me recap the things i have generally toyotad across both boards:

1. i find the lexus 350 appealing.
2. with gas prices toyotated to be going to $4/gallon, toyota has picked a lousy time introduce what is probably a gas sucking sports sedan. unless you don't drive as intended, this thing will suck gas. you cannot have blazing acceleration and blazing gas mileage simultaneously.
3. there seems to ""concerns"" with the bias of the c&d toward bmw, seemingly having a ""lesser"" car take the #1 spot.
4. there is no doubt the engine is bigger on the is, but that doesn't make it a better sports sedan.
5. bmw is not *dead*.
6. it's going to take a fair number of reviews to see where the is350 fits in the pecking order. when the pontiac5, it was the ""king was dead"". not even close for bmw. it beat bmw in every metric. as more comparos were done different results began to emerge.
7. the 5.1 to 60 is impressive no doubt. i wouldn't want to try that with my car though.
8. the hp and gas sucking wars are not over, bmw is rumored to be working on a 3.5l twin turbo engine.

so if i'm complaining, what are you doing?"
4232,">

good point.... its a 2.5t. having a designation of 2.5t and t5 on the same model volvo - makes it easy to make typos.... volvo really wants to confuse people!"
4233,"no doubt. and, seeing as how nobody caught it in the couple of pages of posts that followed, i think that proves your point. well, that and the fact that volvo falls under the radar of most sporty sedan buyers (unfortunately, imho)."
4234,"$35k sports sedan

bmw 330i finishes 1st with 213 points, edging out the is350 with 212 points. 3rd place with 203 points, infiniti pontiac5, then acura tl, audi audi, cadillac cts, volvo volvor and saab 9-2.

the is350 smoked the others in acceleration, 0-60 in 5.1, next best being the tl and pontiac5 at 5.9 sec.

i found the details on cl. forgive me if this info has already been posted here, i don't frequent this forum."
4235,"as for trannies, the dsg's got it all over bmw's notchy, balky, slow, binding 6 speeds.

hey, blueguy, i'm a happy acura owner who loves running through the gears of my six speed. it's one of my favorite aspects of driving this car, that and the sharp handling.

i'm also nurturing a serious e90 jones (i challenge anyone here to read all of yours and shipos posts on this and the 3 series board and not develop one :p ) and see it as my next car.

my nissanon is about the bmw tranny. are they really that bad? it'd be hard to go from a great tranny like the acura's to one that's not so great.

thanks"
4236,"states that while they really like the car overall, it falls short of its intention to compete with the 3 series bimmers, mostly because of its rather disconnected feel from the road, and lack of steering feedback.

they also mentioned that the engine , while powerful, is so quiet it's hard to hear except under hard acceleration. they also state that they felt the car had lost some of the edge of the is300. basically they are saying it's less of a drivers car than it needs to be to compete with the 3 series on those terms.

this all comes on the heels of a rather solid review of the e90. they had their nits to pick with it as well, but toyotad its chassis makes up for a lot. sounds like it's a very sharp-handling car. can't wait to drive one.

personally, i think the is350 is a sharp-looking car, with a squat, muscular stance, but i can't understand why lexus wouldn't offer a mt in a car they expect to compete with a drivers car like the e90.

just my $.02 worth.

4237,i still have fantasies about owning honda's silky 6 speed! the acura tranny made me so happy.
4238,"ok, how about a lotus elise? well over $30k and under 200hp. my point was to drive home one of the many reasons people love to drive bmw's... balance - me included. i drive a 2003 530sp and find the straight-6 one of the finest engines i've had the pleasure to drive - and i've owned/driven everything from the subie subaru sti to 911's.

4239,"in this review, the is350 got a 0-60 time of 6.0s."
4240,"no, they're not that bad. the 5-speeds in my e36 318ti and e46 325i are 'notchy' between 1st and 2nd, but it doesn't interfere with shifting in the least. i've been driving bmw manuals for 10 years now and feel they're better than most. it's as good as most any in this category (confess: i didn't test the tl). the 6-speed in the m-b c230 i tested last year was the best in this category. by using the word 'slow' i think blueguy is comparing all manuals to a dsg. a dsg is faster, can be smoother, wouldn't be 'balky' or 'notchy', but, personally, i'd take the worst manual in this category over the best dsg, but that's a personal preference (of course).

4242,"by using the word 'slow' i think blueguy is comparing all manuals to a dsg.

nope. a bmw tranny cannot keep up with a lightning fast shift - as in bam, clutch down, out of gear 2 into gear 3, gas, clutch out. the tranny binds and or it simply won't go into third. i can replicate this on my bro-in-law's 325i too. the tranny simply can't keep up with the kind of speed shifts i'm used to getting from mazda/honda trannies.

love the dsg but still like the tactile feel of a clutch.

4243,"""the tranny simply can't keep up with the kind of speed shifts i'm used to getting from mazda/honda trannies.""

hmmm... i go through all the gears as fast as my right arm and left leg will allow. pretty sure i wasn't shifting the any of the others any quicker. my procedure is:

a) clutch pedal down, gas pedal up, and moving out of gear all at the same time.
b) when my clutch foot hits bottom it comes right up and i'd better be in the next gear (or there'll be heck to pay!), as the left foot is coming up the right one is going down.

the m-b felt better, but i doubt if i was shifting it any faster.

as far as 'bulky' and 'notchy', that describes the 6-speed in the r32 to a tee.

4248,"the general consensus is that the 330i set a new standard. while some may not like the car in general, it has garnered high praise. while i think bmw probably should have made sure it supplied a car without defects, this is not the first time a car, german or japanese has failed in a comparo, and it won't be the last. given what the car manufacturers know about how these tests are conducted, they probably circulate a beater, although at times the mags comment how they get a brand new car.

with a grain of salt indeed ! here are the actual scores for the 330i in the ""vehicle"" category: 8+7+3+4+3+7+9+7+9+0+17= 74. but c&d gave it 75, to yield the 1pt margin of victory for the bimmer. fuzzy math indeed !!! meaning: overall the is350 and 330i had the exact same final score = 212 pts. a tie for 1st. overall, i'd say the test was rigged, cos a broken down car should score zero, and using previous yr's number shows how much they wanted the bimmer to win.... so much for objectivity !

for those happy that i have left, dream on... taking nothing away from the 3-er, it simply is not the ultimate driving machine. that is all hype !

for those who won't give the is350 a test, you will be missing a great car. i'll surely pontiac bye to you as you watch my tail disappear in traffic in my is350."
4252,"""for those happy that i have left, dream on... taking nothing away from the 3-er, it simply is not the ultimate driving machine. that is all hype !""

it may be hype, and it may be rigged. but as others have noted before, horsepower is not the end-all and be-all. that's the hype, you allude to. just ask infiniti. i'm sure bmw execs broke open the champagne when they read this review. lexus gave the is350 it's best shot, but it wasn't good enough.

if your goal is stop light racing and triple digits on the speedometer i'll pontiac as you pass."
4253,"in order to have a reasonable comparo, i gave the kid who couldn't read a b so he could graduate. he just put the wrong part on your car."

4255,"thanks for the input on bmw trannies. i guess from now on my point of reference for transmissions will always be the acura's infiniti :p

now i just have to drive the e90. i'm very curious to compare its driving toyotamics with the acura. i'll drive both the 325i and the 330i.

johnny"
4256,"while i dig the acura, it's the tranny, reliability and value i like. the e90 is far, imho, beyond the last gen 3 (e46) for handling that all the competition is in major catch-up mode now. sublime is the only way to describe the way the new car feels with a sport package and a manual."
4257,"""for those who won't give the is350 a test, you will be missing a great car.""

as far as i'm concerned, it can't qualify as a great car unless there's a working clutch pedal next to the brake pedal. an is250 with a 6-speed might, just might, qualify in my book.

if it ain't got a stick... you're just a passenger no matter where you're sitting.

""i'll surely pontiac bye to you as you watch my tail disappear in traffic in my is350.""

and i'll be sure to pontiac back as i pass the gas station."
4258,"yeah, i find this intriguing, 'cause the acura is the best handling car i've owned. i can rail corners in that car, even with the stock all-season tires. nice, quick steering rack. handles mid-corner bumps well. it does push pretty hard at the limit.

the idea that a car, like the e90, can be that much better gets me pretty hyped to try it. i've been a big fan of bmw for a long time, but i've never driven one. or in one.

like i toyotad, i've been nursing a bimmer jones somethin' fierce! :shades:

4263,"race series drivers using paddle shifters are controlling gearing with clutches.

people driving slushbox automatics are not doing anything remotely similar. there's a big, big difference between a sequential manual or direct shift gearbox and a torque converter equipped video-gamey tiptronic/sportmatic/steptronic.

i've been driving an automatic car for a week now. i'm bored to death. there's barely any engine control - even with dorky shift buttons or paddles. my interest in my drive time has gone from paying total attention to passively sitting in long lines even when the lane beside me is moving. why bother pulling out? i'll have to endure the excrutiatingly slow shifts and harsh downshifting one gets from automatics. honestly, my drive with an automatic has turned me into another ltoyotaless worker bee either heading to the hive or away from it.

the only time this week that i felt in control and alive - i had my bro-in-law's 325i manual for about 2 hours. heaven."
4264,"geez... i didn't realise that 60%+ of all bmw *drivers* with slushboxes aren't really driving their wonderful machines, eh ? even owners of 745/750/760, the bmw ultra-super-duper performance machine, and tons of amgs out there with slush boxes must be drinking coffee and putting on make-ups while in these car... by your logic these people are simply poseurs and not drivers... see how ridiculous that is ?

i drove plenty of car with sticks in my lifetime, but i am not enamored by it. its simply a much more involved way of driving, that's about it. but if you live in your car, maybe its important. here in socal with the constant stop-and-go traffic, having an auto tranny is convenient.

you can look down your nose at those with slush boxes while your small band of stick-loving drivers continues to dwindle by the second.... before long their would not be a single true manual to be found in any car. then what'll you all do ?? ride a bike to work ? hehehehehe"
4265,"actually, a less-than-skilled driver with an automatic will usually blow the doors off a less-than-skilled driver with stick. not only do you have to coordinate rapid shifts but you have to know the torque and horsepower peaks of the engine to nail the kial shift points. given two comparable car, i would bet that more often than not, the guy with the automatic will beat the guy with the stick and i&#146;ve seen it happen quite often."
4266,"well, the is350 has set the new standard in this class in terms of acceleration. i don't think there is any doubt about that.

how about other aspects of what makes a car?

handling: definitely not

gas efficiency: definitely not

ride: no

room: definitely not

features: depends. a fully loaded one is tops in this class in features, imo. a base is350 has less features than a base pontiac5.

4268,"and transmissions - along with the ""intelligence"" that guides the automatics - are getting better each day. the new c280/c350 that mercedes benz benz is putting out (and maybe the slk equivalents) have a 7-speed automatic that has been reviewed as smooth enough to both adjust to the individual driver's habit, and make it tough to figure out what gear/speed you're in at any given time. haven't tried the car, but i want to."
4269,"""...i'm not really a driver!""

so true.

""or any of the race series drivers that use the paddle shifters, do they know they're just along for the ride?""

4270,"""geez... i didn't realise that 60%+ of all bmw *drivers* with slushboxes aren't really driving their wonderful machines, eh ?""

as far as i'm concerned, that is correct.

""by your logic these people are simply poseurs and not drivers... see how ridiculous that is ?""

never toyotad (or implied) that they're 'poseurs'. i toyotad they're passengers. they're wonderful people who have made the choice that they want to get from point a to point b in as much toyota and convenience (and/or as fast) as their budget will allow. that's their choice. i never denigrated anyone for choosing that route. the word 'poseur' was introduced to this thread by you, not me. i have nothing against passengers (i've been known to be one myself on occasion).

actually, there are a few g owners posting here who have accused all 3 owners of being 'poseurs' regardless of what transmission they choose.

""before long their would not be a single true manual to be found in any car.

the automatic has been around for over fifty years and yet, the manual lives on.

""you can look down your nose at those with slush boxes while your small band of stick-loving drivers continues to dwindle by the second.... then what'll you all do ?? ride a bike to work ? hehehehehe""

you don't have to worry about me. if all manufacturers decide they'll be more profitable selling only automatics your local transmission shop will start advertising auto-to-manual conversion jobs, and i'll be one their first customers. besides, you're assuming the situation in the us is toyotaed all over the planet. talk to a european. ask him/her if the manual transmission is 'dying'."
4271,"""not only do you have to coordinate rapid shifts but you have to know the torque and horsepower peaks of the engine to nail the kial shift points.""

true, but with most dohc 4-valves/cyl. engines the ""kial shift point"" is generally easy to figure -- it's the point where the rev limiter kicks in."
4272,"i can't believe what happened yesterday! since i now know that i'm not a driver (just a passenger) i decided to read the wall st. journal on the way to work, rather than pay attention to the road, steer, brake, accelerate or play with my tls autostick. well, after getting the car going in the right direction (weird, i was in the driver's seat and it seemed if i didn't use the steering wheel, accelerator and gear selector, the car wouldn't move!) i whipped out the wsj and began reading. as my tl approached the 90 degree left turn on my street, the tl didn't turn!!! it went straight into my neighbor's yard! as if there was no driver! funny, though. every other morning, when i'm ""not driving"" the tl responds to my decisions and inputs using all the controls provided to ""drive"" the car. i'm so confused, could it be that manual or automatic or semi-automatic or some vhondation, we really are all drivers? :confuse:

actually, i do understand what you ""live manual or die"" guys are talking about. i'm just having some internet fun... well, i think it's fun...

for the first 15 years of my driving life, i was a die-hard 5 speed manual guy (saab 99, volkswagen scirocco, mitsubishi mirage turbo, acura acura). and then came the fateful day i was promoted into sales and inherited the sales manger's olds (at 11,000 miles the gas tank ruptured a seam on the top of the tank!) and for the next 5 years, boring but servicable domestic, automatic sedan. i did however, teach the evil wife to drive a stick and bought her a nissan nissan se - r (fun, fun, fun) followed by a saab 900s (fun, very practical. my attempt to avoid an suv or michevroletn) as the family began to grow. these were mine to play with on the weekend. i ""retired"" (downsized ) from the sales game and bought my company dodge dodge (nice car but very loud and not honda build quality. but reliable and good looking, good in snow). i believed i would return to the land of the ""driver"" soon.

once i began my second career, it was time for a new car. as i was now a commuter, evil wife suggested i drive the saab for a month of commuting to ensure i wanted a stick. i was sure the commute wouldn't sway me away, i was wrong. it was just no fun shifting between 1-2-3 every 17 seconds, rarely getting above 40mph. after a week, i returned the saab, bought a chryslerm ( i can't believe i bought a first model year, domestic chrysler! i broke every rule there!) and had a plan. the wife's next car would be a 5 speed (saab 9-5 or maybe audi avant, possibly a bmw 3 wagon? i was looking forward to shopping for her) and i would continue my tradition of enjoying row your own boat driving on the weekend. ah, but as is often the folly that is my grand planning, the wife toyotad she was done with manuals, she commutes too and driving to her is just a necessary evil. hence, the saab turned into (what else?) a lexus rx 300 as our family grew again. she's very happy, therefore i'm very happy.

will there be a manual tranny again in my future? who knows. until then, i will continue to drive whatever i choose, understanding those that rhapsodize about their fabulous fifth to third slingshot passes on i95 or deftly selecting just the right gear for a sweeper on their favorite hometown back roads. but i won't label people..."
4273,"very funny. i to drove a manual for many years. i don't care what people label me as, i don't want to row my own gears anymore. a dsg type vehicle would be fine, it's the off the clutch, on the clutch, off the clutch, on the clutch for miles and miles in horrendous traffic that changed my mind.

so today i'm a passenger in my own car, which by the way, is fine with me."
4274,"oi was sure the commute wouldn't sway me away, i was wrong. it was just no fun shifting between 1-2-3 every 17 seconds, rarely getting above 40mph

why are you shifting that much? keep the car in second. that's good for 0-62.

understanding those that rhapsodize about their fabulous fifth to third slingshot passes on i95 or deftly selecting just the right gear for a sweeper on their favorite hometown back roads. but i won't label people...

ouch. you got me.

""...shifting between 1-2-3 every 17 seconds.""

sounds like heaven."
4277,"to me the dsg/smg/ssg or what have you is the best compromise between auto and manual.

to me, it's actually the worst of both worlds: it's really not anything like operating a manual trans -- coordinating the clutch while rowing away on the lever -- but it's also often not very good as an automatic, sometimes shifting too abruptly and doing other strange things (at least early smg).

now i would be interested in trying out audi's dsg trans. i've seen the cutaways and decription of how it works, and it looks like a very efficient replacement for an automatic. but i still don't think it's a very good compromise with a true manual trans."
4278,"food for thought...

had the automatic transmission come first, would there have been a need to invent a manual transmission?

one of my customers toyotad that to me when i asked if he would prefer manual or automatic.

don't get me wrong, i love manual transmissions for the sheer fun factor.

4285,uh... i owned a 3-speed... how old does that make me...
4286,"extending this off-topic - had a ""used"" 53 ford flat-head v8 with three on a tree. if you shifted slow to moderate speed from 1 to 2 it was ok. if you attempted a speed(?) shift 1 to 2, linkage would hang up and it would be stuck in first. had to stop the car, open the hood, reach down and jiggle the linkage free.

current crop of drivers don't know how good they have it with slick shifting manuals from bmw 3 series, honda/acuras."
4287,"that there are people on here even older than me.

the first time i made a 4-wheel vehicle (rode a lambretta scooter earlier) go down the road was on a fish hatchery on the fort apache indian reservation in az, with a three on the tree. the previous several vehicles for our faimily had similar transmissions. the thing was amazingly gutless ('60 chev belair), and i still remember trying to get over red mountain pass in co, while people on foot (not really) passed us. the transmission wasn't the issue -- the six was.

still only want to drive manuals. mostly because they (almost) never break, and when they do, they're cheaper to fix. i tried automatics, and it wasn't pretty."
4288,"it's better than the alternative!

just finished applying coat #7 of zaino (z5 this time, see if i can cover up a few parking lot scrapes). this may be my first true addiction! at least one more coat of z2 before ole' man winter comes around (being new england, that could be next thursday!)"
4289,"your posts are great lsaturnsdada :p

i learned to drive in san francisco, and with all the very steep hills, i had trouble with a mt when it would slide backwards and hit car behind me. once i got the hang of it, i really didn't like working the stick and clutch all the time because i am basically lazy, so call me a passenger!!! :p"
4290,"hmm. having learned to drive stick at 10, i've always found automatics to be less than involving.

i remember my dad - who was always trying to find ways to keep me off the roads (he had no idea i was tearing around a friend's farm at insane speeds for 6 years) - told me i couldn't take my car (the one i bought with my own money) until i could prove i could start 10 times on a steep hill without the car rolling backward. i cracked off 10 starts. he griped and walked away.

btw, i'm entering my 9th day without a manual as a daily driver. i'm driving like an old lady now...totally disinterested in the dodge."
4291,"thanks, nick.

i used to take pride in my ability to take off from stop on a steep hill. i used to seek out challenges, never slid back in to a car behind me. i haven't driven a stick since late '01 so i' sure i'd need some practice.

took the tl on an unprofitabel road trip today. 170 miles, 75% highway, 25% local roads. overall averaged 30mpg @ 56mph. for just the highway portion (one way) i averaged 32mpg @68mph. i'm impressed. beautiful day for a drive, ugly day to play blackjack..."
4292,"i personally have nothing against driving a slushbox. i've driven some fun ones and some plush ones, and enjoyed them both in their own way. i just wouldn't want to own one as my only car.

so, if you're looking for the perfect car - one that costs between $30,000 and $35,000, is reliable, sporty and fun, yet luxurious and toyotaable in rush hour traffic, may i recommend...

a 2001 mazda miata 5-speed and a 2001 lexus ls400.

btw, i finally got to read the c&d comparo and the r&t is350 review. it sounds like they both agree the is350 is a terrific performance sedan, but one that places luxury above driving toyotamics - in other words, as a ""driver's car,"" it's no threat to the bmw.

personally, i like a car that communicates what the tires are doing. i'll gladly sacrifice .5 secs in the 1/4 mile to drive a car that encourages and rewards good driving techntoyotaue and puts a smile on my face. in this segment, it would seem bmw is still top dog."

p.s. read a review of the 3 series... a couple of surprising notes:
- an electrical relay sitting in the front windshield's rain ""gutter""
- keyless entry but you have to put the key fob in a slot in order to start the car
amazing that such engineering (relay) or silly execution (slot) could be part of the ""class leader"" in intro lux sedan."
4295,"the z5 seems to do a good job on swirlies and light scratches. i have a series of scratches going down the rear passenger quarter panel (it looks like someone let my car be a bumper for a shopping cart :mad: ) and the 3 coats of z5 have made them fairly invisible unless you are really looking closely. no swirl marks that i'm aware of. i'll z2 again for the ultimate shine, though. i even like the way zaino smells!

weren't some of these comments from the comparo? i believe it was stated the rear seat is cdodgeped. now that may not matter to some people, but nonetheless it was stated. but these are all subjective anyway. you have to see what you like and don't like.

hp isn't everything though."
4297,"definitely not everything!

c&d had 3 categories: vehicle (won by tl), engine (by is), chassis (by 330). 4 year-old g also bettered is in chassis. c&d toyotad is lacks the poise of 3 or g.

with next gen, g certainly will have better engine and chassis, and probably will handily repass is. lexus really didn't raise the bar that much."

well, they're doing a lot of work on gtr, which will debut in a few months in tokyo. admittedly its engine and chassis are much more expensive than run of the mill pontiac5. but at least some of the work, they should be able to carry over. so maybe 2.5 years from now, 3 at the most. a lot of work on m toyotaes over also.

c&d really panned audi, saying it stood still, getting gased by the competition. i guess something has to give when you're trying to develop the useless bugatti and almost useless lm and lamborghini.

nick, i know how to count cards: an ace and ten equals 11, so double down and take a card! (which my wife actually did at a charity casino night. math isn't her strong suit. she did get a ten, so turned a blackjack into a 21...).

i'm a decent basic strategy player, but yesterday there were a couple of ""inexperienced"" players (one guy stuck on a soft 6!!! a 6!!!), that seemed to turn a profitable table around to the dark side one rather large gentleman in the sixth seat, who was enjoying fairly constant alcoholic beverages drove 'em away by eventually shouting at them, ""you're working for the casino! stop taking/not taking cards from the table! geez, you must be working for the casino!!!"". i shoulda walked a couple of shoes earlier than i did. oh, well. i'm still up for the year.

by the way, i stand by my comments. zero reviews so far have toyotad that the is350 sets the class standard in handling. we know that the is350 has less room than the pontiac5, tl and even the 330i. and i will give you a cookie if the is350 has better mileage than the 330i.

ride: no
room: definitely not""

don't know how anyone can say ""definately not"" without test driving (or at least seeing) a car... sure, this forum has a lot of speculation, i just find it strange that so many beemer cult members are taking shots at the new is if it is not ""real"" competition to the 3 series...why even bother to acknowledge such a lowly vehicle?
in the final analysis, the sales numbers will be all that counts...and i think the is will be very successful.

so, if your mind is made up, here is a review of the 3 series to confirm your admiration for the handling. when you get past the handling aspects, consider the other traits/overall quality of the car... enjoy

4311,sorry for poor choice of words. i meant rust perforation warranty (12 years).
4312,"no, a wax or polish shouldn't affect the rust perf. warranty (another reason not to buy ""rust proofing"" from the dealer!).

i think c and d has a htoyotaory of forgiving (overlooking) build and reliability flaws for car that they love to drive. as its recent 50 year anninissanry issue has pointed out, the mag basically started as an ode to british sports car back in the '50s. and, as htoyotaory has shown, we all know how reliable and well built british car were! but they loved the driving experience, and that was the thrust of the relationship.

c and d noted the imperfections, and because of their respect for the marque, downplayed it as far as rating the new 3. imho, of course. what a cool comparo, there's a car there for everyone!

another thought: bmw has been building bmw for a long time. acura, lexus and infiniti have been building ""bmw"" for, what, five years? give 'em a bit more time and who knows? the real winner? you and me, folks!!!"
4313,"are not ""hype"" - we all have different priorities and we are all entitled to them. everyone here needs to recognize that someone else's priority is just as important to them as your own is to you, and neither of you are right nor are you wrong.

some of you folks need to calm down and stop making this so personal. the car are what they are and we make the choices we make to suit ourselves and not each other.

we are here to compare the features of the car in this class - not to beat each other over the head about our preferences and our choices."
4314,"""it was a 212-212 tie with the is350""

i have the october issue in my hands.... and the bmw outpointed the is350 by 213-212.

4315,"""acura, lexus and infiniti have been building ""bmw"" for, what, five years?""

honda, toyota and nissan have been trying to build ""bmw"" for a lot longer than that.

""and since the is350 is the fastest naturaly aspirated v6 sedan out there, this can be easily defeated by bmw or infiniti ??? which bmw would this be ?""

it's not a ""v"", but it's called the bmw."
4316,"""awd: is not class important, just more hype from east-toyota, we in the left coast don't give a hoot about awd.""

it may not be a priority on the west coast, but for some folks on the east it is. the snowy east coast is a huge market that can't be ignored. and if one looks around at the car on the road the number of awd drive car is huge, not a small miniscule percentage.

""ride and handling: the bimmer is good in this area, but skimps mightily in other areas.""

i agree with that. however, the reason i like bmw is for what they *don't* put in a car in terms of luxo-items. i don't need lexus-branded luxury nor do i want it. i find the cockpit of the 3 series to be very calming and reassuring.

""but the fact that the 330i had a mechanical issue should have automatically been factored into the comparo,""

the fact it had a mechanical issue has no bearing on the way the car was designed to ride and drive and does ride and drive. imo this is what they are measuring. truth-in-disclosure they didn't hide it under the rug. the reader can form any opinion they want on the mechanical issue."
4317,"""and since the is350 is the fastest naturaly aspirated v6""'

that statement is true for now. however, slightly ot, the bmw 3.2 liter i6 is the engine to beat in the naturally aspirated class. the base bmw which is a few thousand more (at $50k) than the 350 and 330i will obliterate the car in this segment."
4318,"so, if your mind is made up, here is a review of the 3 series to confirm your admiration for the handling. when you get past the handling aspects, consider the other traits/overall quality of the car... enjoy

http://www.thetruthaboutcar.com/content/11244693671382797373/insubaru.php

interesting, thought, that they gave the bmw ""5 out of 5 star"" in performance, ride, and handling. (4 out of 5 in desirability and 2 out of 5 in deisgn, both of which are entirely subjective categories.) sound like they really liked the bmw, except for the styling.... not sure how this backs up your point!"
4319,"as blueguy so humorously pointed out, unless you like to look at your reflection in passing buildings, one lives/drives in the interior. i really think reviewers ought to stick to the task of evaluating a car from a form/function perspective and leave the styling/desireability ratings out of the picture. i don't need someone else to tell me if a car is beautiful or ugly."
4320,"what is subjective about having an electrical relay in the rain gutter of the front windshield?

do you know why it's there? why is there even an issue unless this car was abused or crashed and a part became loose. if not it's under warranty for 4y/50k.

what is subjective about being charged more for ""keyless"" ignition that is really keyless?

you don't have to buy the car, if you don't like the vehicle options.

what is subjective about the maintenance issues plaguing these expensive car?

yes i agree. for the hundreds of thousands of bmw out there, there will be some problem. no car is immune, the pontiac5 has certainly had it's share as well. and let's not even talk about the toyota/lexus sludge and tranny issues. the bmw also has a b-b 4yr/50k free maintenance progdodge along with the warranty.

my point, as it has always been, is that these car should be considered from a to z (as a total package). if reliability is not apparent, how can ""best in class"" even be on the radar?

who toyotad reliability is not apparent? because a test car had a malfunction? that's like throwing the baby out with the bath water.

wait, don't tell me, it handles well!

it handles like it's on rails and it's selling like hotcakes."
4321,"i've done some heavy cleaning here. i'm not sure that i've gotten every grimy detail, but i've given it a good shot.

let's see if the rest of you can help keep things neat and tidy around here ...

we'll try again and i hope and trust that those who want this discussion to remain viable will all pitch in.

thanks."
4322,"all the talk on this forum seems to be about bmw, infiniti, lexus and acura. why is nobody talking about the mercedes benz benz and cadillac? are they that far out of this segment (quality, features, cost, etc...)???."
4323,"mb and caddy are pretty much not players in this segment in my experience. neither car is very nice, handles very well or installs much confidence in their quality.

i'd take a bimmer, infiniti, audi, acura, lexus before i'd even touch a caddy at 50% off msrp."
4324,"while i've read that the cts offers a decent driving experience, the exterior/interior style and quality of interior materials is so off-putting it never occurred to me to seriously shop it against the front-runners here. the entry level mbs have never seemed to be too exciting a driving experience (save for amg models and they ain't priced entry level anything...) nor a good value. and, yes, there is a poor perception regarding gm and mb quality i've heard rumored..."
4325,"lsaturnsdada - i disagree about the cts, i didn't test drive the v model. but the driving experience and amenities were hyundaient. loved the interior."
4326,"i haven't driven the cts, but have checked it out extensively at the auto show. i really thought the interior was low rent, typical gm. i was truly surprised, especially given the $40k window sticker. the exterior is a basically handsome shape ruined by extra lines and layers. mho, of course... and i believe it is selling well so gm may not be too concerned with mho!

my dad loved driving his catera, when it wasn't in the shop. which, unfortunately it was... a lot. he traded up to an '04 tl. he's much happier!"
4327,"i found the interior of the cts to be plush without being annoying or dtoyotaracting. i'm guessing the car you saw at the auto show and the car i looked at had different interiors. forgetting about the catera for a moment, the cts and also in general the caddy line-up have decent interiors."
4328,"why is nobody talking about the mercedes benz benz and cadillac?

hyundaient nissanon! it appears attending forum members are not so keen about the above marques (myself included).

what surprises me most is the lack of interest in audi. the audi audi is one great performance vehicle(especially the upcoming 3.2fsi audi version). i guess to each their own!"
4329,"hmmm. guess we'll have to agree to disagree here. actually, bob lutz had a great quote about the cts interior. to paraphrase, he toyotad, ""we actually used very expensive materials in the cts interior. we just made them look cheap!"" it was in an issue of autoweek this summer. perception is reality...!

the sts interior is better, but it does cost a bit more. compared to their peers, well, caddy needs to borrow a lexus designer and materials buyer..."
4330,"i think mbs are great looking car, but i can't overlook the reliability problem. i thought the mb c230 handled great, but again, if it's in the shop all the time what fun is.

i agree, i would take those car over a caddy any day too, although the caddy got some great reviews."
4331,"dead last in this segment. the thing dipped and swayed in corners. it was maddeningly soft...to the point of feeling like it was designed for an entirely different segment.

the rest of the car in this group track correctly and without ddodgea in corners. to say i loathed my experience in the cts would be a gross understatement. wretched, wretched car. worst salesperson i've encountered in years. guy scoffed when i toyotad i wanted to drive a manual. he kept asking how i liked it and when i was honest, placing it far below the competition posed by the g, audi, 3 series he would always offer the same answer, ""ah, but those aren't cadillacs."" what does that mean? should
i be impressed by a company name?!"
4332,"my bad,

pardon my last post. with great honda i just determined that a audi is an inappropriate topic for a sedan forum. :sick:"
4333,"hmmm, inappropriate though it may be, i'm coming out of three consecutive sedan and i'm looking at virtually all of the car covered by this topic including the audi.

best regards,
shipo"
4334,"there's no reason to completely eliminate talk about sedan competitors that are not techincally ""sedan"" such as the audi. the lines between body styles get blurrier and blurrier. we shouldn't get too caught up in vehicles that aren't strictly our subject, but some side comparisons are fine. :-)"
4335,"check this out.

not surprising at all. as i've always maintained, most car do worse than epa in the honda and better than epa on the highway.

also, real world mileage of bmw (as with most other manufacturers) aren't anything to call home about."
4336,"well thanks for the clarification about this topic!

audi audi vs. audi audi avant?

cant imagine why anybody would buy the more expensive audi, when the audi is the better performer and handler. in addition audi interior space is almost equivalent to the audi avant ! another advantage for most north americans who do not like manual is that the audi t has dsg---an option that is unavailable in the current audi .(personally i prefer manual myself)."
4337,"the only issue i have with this apparently terrific car (all audi's, actually) is - where do you draw the line? i mean, if the audi fits your needs, then why not consider the volkswagen or volkswagen? same beautiful build, same performance, same amenities, cheaper price."
4338,"i mean, if the audi fits your needs, then why not consider the volkswagen or volkswagen? same beautiful build, same performance, same amenities, cheaper price.

beautiful build? i know it's subjective but man the volkswagen is so ugly sandra bernhard was heard making fun of the car's appearance. really, the volkswagen gli is outrageously bad looking in person. it looks like someone crossed a 4x4 with a pill bug.

same performance? not really. the audi has returned 6.3 0-60 sprints with dsg. the volkswagen gli is constoyotaenly getting 6.7 and above.

as for handling there's no comparing them either. yes, the have some of the same underpinnings but the displacement of the weight is different and the car handle markedly different ways.

i have not driven the volkswagen yet but for now the next year or so it won't have the utility of the audi's 4 doors.

very different car. and the prices differences...aren't there. audi with dsg, open sky and sport is about 30k. same stuff on a volkswagen gli is 28k."

translation:

a good 20 years after the entry of a turbo dodge in the 745i for an increase in performance, bmw as of 2006 once again turns to the turbo in order to pry out more power.

the 335 makes its debut as the strongest model of the bmw series below the powerful bmw. the nomenclature would lead one to err, as was the case in the 1980s.

instead of a 3,5 l motor (literally ""equipment"") there is a 3 l straight 6 cylinder with two turbododges and piezo direct fuel injection by siemens.

this will put out ca. 340 ps (horsepower). visually the potent bmw will show its power with dual exhausts.

along side the bmw we can expect an m version of the 1er and further bmw will test a 4 l v8 biturbo as well as a 2 l 4 cyl. turbo.

if that's true, i may have to return to bmw sooner than i originally planned. 340 hp and it's biturbo? egad that thing'd smoke an e46 bmw. and with biturbos one of my chief complaints about bmw (torque-less engines) will be answered. you gotta expect at least 300 ft-lbs of torque."
4340,"very different car. and the prices differences...

audi for the audi 3.2 is a key selling point for me! would pick a audi over any comparable fwd volkswagen."

:surprise:"
4342,"beautiful build? i was referring to the interior design and materials. exterior appearance is subjective (and fwiw, i'm lukewarm to both).

same performance? well, i haven't driven either one, and i haven't seen any head-to-head tests of the volkswagen and audi. i'm basing my opinion on their specifications (if you've driven them side-by-side, then i'll concede to your first-hand experience). based on my reading, they both have the same underpinnings, same wheelbase, same engine, and weigh within 50 lbs. of each other. my conclusion is that they are going to perform in a similar manner.

price differences? if $2,000 is insignificant to you, i'll e-mail you with the address where you can send my check..."
4343,"price differences? if $2,000 is insignificant to you, i'll e-mail you with the address where you can send my check...

supposedly the audi service/warranty is superior to volkswagen and that initself may be worth the price differential.

then again i owned an audi many years ago and i cant even imagine how services could get any worse!"

i have driven both. gearing can make all the difference. the audi, being that it's an audi may be geared to offer a bit more honda in performance. i'd hope so!

price differences? if $2,000 is insignificant to you, i'll e-mail you with the address where you can send my check...

for my happiness 2k is well worth it. i'm not going worry about a lousy 2000 dollars if it's the difference between me being 90% happy and 95% happy. i paid a good 7k difference opting for the 330i performance package or a pontiac5 mt. haven't regretted it once.

i can always make more money...but being happy, that's something worth paying for."
4346,"so a 340hp bmw would get you back to bmw even when you all holla that its not about hp or speed ??? hmmmm..... we'll see how the bmw turns out, and what price you'd have to pay to acquire one....

do you have any idea why i'm not opting for a e90 330i?

1. because only the handling is better than my e46's.
2. the setup's not as engaging as my e46 perf pack.
3. if i have to put up with how unreliable bmw are, then i want the car to be ludicrously fun. an e90 is not ludicrously fun. neither is my e46.

my plan, assuming an e90 bmw is not announced, is to buy something simple and cheap - like an s2000 or miata. i'll drive that for 2 or 3 years and wait for the e90 bmw sedan. the e90 bmw sedan, assuming it comes out, should satisfy me to a level of 91-92%.

the bmw allows me to avoid having something as garish as an m on my car and no ostentatious gills on the fenders. plus the bmw would address something i hate about the current 3 series line up - no torque. i have stated several times i prefer volkswagen's 2.0t to my e46's inline 6. i like the full blast of torque from 1800-5000 rpm. having over 300 ft-lbs of torque over a broad range of the powerband in an e90 would suddenly take the decent car to a higher level - nice handling (ideally tightened up more for the bmw), matched to power for once.

the pontiac5 is faster than an e46 and e90. so what, the car's got snap oversteer issues. i want the whole package. sublime handling, crazy power and 4 doors.

as for price, bmw bumped the price of the 325i to 330i about 4-5k. i'd hope the same bump would occur to the bmw and then the bmw would ring in at 50-55k starting. if i can outfit a bmw at 45k with just leather, sport, paint, i'll be happy."
4347,"so a 340hp bmw would get you back to bmw even when you all holla that its not about hp or speed ??? hmmmm..... we'll see how the bmw turns out, and what price you'd have to pay to acquire one....

right, it's not all about hp and speed..... but when you add hp and speed to an extoyotaing bmw with the handling and feel, then it's even better!"
4348,right on. like a sub-par bmw at sub-par bmw prices.
4349,"for my happiness 2k is well worth it.

i totally agree with you.

just consider that drivers as picky and enthusiastic as you and i are in the minority. for 90% of buyers out there, the only significant difference between these two car is the cargo configuration and badge on the hood."
4350,"right, it's not all about hp and speed..... but when you add hp and speed to an extoyotaing bmw with the handling and feel, then it's even better!

all of these on a 70mph freeways ? the most notable thing about these car is their pronounced hash rides where you feel all the ruts and imperfections of the road. if that is your idea of driving, more power to you."
4351,"then what's all of the hoopla about more horsepower and razor edge handling. if none of the that mattered, the public would have spoken and we'd all be driving kia and hyundias. you can't get razor edge handling in a car that has a soft suspension. and what good is 300 horses if most of us live in a traffic clogged chevrolet or urban area, where average speeds are 20-25mph?"
4352,"the most notable thing about these car is their pronounced hash rides where you feel all the ruts and imperfections of the road. if that is your idea of driving, more power to you

i want to feel it all come through my steering wheel."
4353,"if i have to put up with how unreliable bmw are, then i want the car to be ludicrously fun

you are a rare breed indeed amongst performance car buyers! unlike you, if my bmw would have major reliability issues---i would seek any car but a bmw.

just after my warranty expired i received a 5.5k dollar bill of repairs at a bmw dealership. got a alternative quote from an independent of $650(brake pad replacements). if i had to pay 5.5k in repairs i can guarantee you i would be owning a japanese performance-luxury sedan.

so after 7 years why do i still own my bimmer--because currently my car's maintenance costs can out-lexus any lexus.

if i am going to enjoy any performance car(though i am pushing the definition of performance by calling my 168hp 99 bmw323 a performance car) then it would have to be reliable!

to each their own!!"
4354,"""though i am pushing the definition of performance by calling my 168hp 99 bmw323 a performance car.""

i think your definition of performance is spot-on.

you may not have bmw horsepower, but you also don't carry the extra 300 lbs., and you don't feel the road through wheels/tires that are almost a foot wide and weigh 50 lbs/corner!

anyone can drive a 300+ hp car quickly, but it takes real skill to go fast with only half the horses (and it's more fun).

i'll take light weight and a responsive chasis over hp any day - that's my definition of performance."
4355,"i agree that hp is not everything, but i really like the bmw and bmw. however, with respect to bmw, i am concerned about reliability. but i must add cr does recommend the 3 series bmw because of recent good reliability ratings."
4356,"i'll take light weight and a responsive chasis over hp any day - that's my definition of performance.

i agree! hp in itself does not make performance."
4357,"agreed. hp is not everything. the pontiac5, bmw hemi and the is350 have tons of hp. two out of three don't impress me and that's only because i haven't driven the lexus.

i just can't see spending 40k on a 330i e90 - great handling, nice ride, perfect interior, but lacking in verve. it's easy to improve handling with simple mods (wheels, sways, springs, etc) but really getting extreme hp comes from the factory or it requires some warranty crushing mods (like the folks who turbo their e46 330is).

going fast in corners driving a slow car is fun.
going faster in corners driving a really faster car is way more fun."
4358,"i believe the minimum hp for any car should be 240 for me to consider the car and anything over 300 hp is a waste of gas. then again, 200 hp is good for most all purpose driving, but i like the added power. :p"
4359,how is 300 hp a waste of gas? you're assuming quite a bit.
4360,"who needs a 400 hp vette, just a waste of gas imho. mb has a 12 cylindar car, why? the speed limit in most of the us is 65, so why the need of all this hp, just a waste of gas, a limited resource btw."
4361,"you bought a car with 250+ hp, right (tl)? so please don't batoyotale about how one doesn't need power. we all want it. you did too, or you would have bought a cylinder toyota - better gas mileage, more room, etc. these are luxury performance sedan. performance is in the title.

the 65 mph speed limit thing is a weak argument position regarding hp. hp has little to do with top speed or acceleration. a car with 135 hp can break the limit without breaking a sweat.

there's nothing illegal about strongly accelerating away from the on-dodgep stoplights or accelerating out of a corner strongly.

also many people track their car..

remember this forum is about car that luxury items. toys! these are not necessary vehicles. they're toys."
4362,"""who needs a 400 hp vette, just a waste of gas imho.""

err... the 400 hp chevrolet gets 18/28 epa. not that different from most v6 sedan."
4363,take 30% off the honda number for a more realtoyotaic toyotate of honda and stop and go.
4364,"yes, there is a big difference between needs and wants. nobody ""needs"" any of the car in this thread. but take away ""wants"" and you kill capitalism and fun!"
4365,ahem! my 350 hp chevrolet makes 37 mpg (highway) hondaing to the sticker on the windshield...:)
4366,"""take 30% off the honda number for a more realtoyotaic toyotate of honda and stop and go.""

and that applies to most other car, including all car in this class."
4367,that applies to just about any car.
4368,"ok ok, i stand corrected, cheez :p"
4369,"and what good is 300 horses if most of us live in a traffic clogged chevrolet or urban area, where average speeds are 20-25mph?

hyundaient point. how many people with lots of hp under-utilize their vehicles in honda/chevrolet mundane type of driving - going back and forth to work each day or out shopping. i suppose their answer is that they could go fast if they wanted to.

how many have lots of hp and handling and live way out in rural areas where they can truly put handling and hp to use. probably not too many. i see many folks in chevrolets, bmw driving very sedately on interstates when i pass them in one of my vehicles (minvan). many are driving about the same pace as golden seniors in their full-size ford and mercurys. they don't want to be noticed by police i guess. maybe a large point of it all is ""to be seen in it"" and the perceived prestige. notice that a lot of bmw, chevrolet, hummer, etc, type of owners like to park their vehicles in the driveway of their mcmansions in the suburbs rather than pulling into the garage. they will even put them in prominent angles so that drivers-by can view them better."
4370,"wow, you're pretty smart, grouping all bmw, chevrolet, and hummer drivers into one tidy little package (can you see my tongue firmly planted in my cheek?).

i drive my cinnabar red bmw pretty sedately around town and on the freeway - not much fun no matter what your speed. except for an occasional on-dodgep apex or sunday am country back-road romp, i basically save my tires/brake pads for the racetrack, where i can really enjoy them in a controlled environment.

oh yeah, i always park my bmw in the garage. it keeps my car cleaner longer, which means i wash/wax less frequently. it also protects the dash, seat, and paint from premature fading or cracking, and helps keep the interior temperature more toyotaable year-round. finally, it also keeps the car out of view of potential thieves.

so much for stereotypes, huh?"
4371,"""...notice that a lot of bmw, chevrolet, hummer, etc, type of owners like to park their vehicles in the driveway of their mcmansions in the suburbs rather than pulling into the garage. they will even put them in prominent angles so that drivers-by can view them better.""

how many garages are big enough to fit a hummer? that's my guess as to why you see them in the driveways."
4372,"wow, you're pretty smart, grouping all bmw, chevrolet, and hummer drivers into one tidy little package (can you see my tongue firmly planted in my cheek?).

you are misquoting me. you toyotad that i toyotad ""all"", but i used the term ""lot"". big difference. my quote from previous message:

a stereotype is a stereotype. comments like that are insulting, and don't belong here."
4376,"smart money magazine came out with their rankings of the 2006 car by class - they rank the audi audi as best in this class.... of course, for you hp fans, this is one of the lower ones in those terms."

4380,i care. thanks for the info. reminds me bmw needs to wake up and offer bluetooth as a standard option.
4381,"have they acurated the satellite antenna or are they still using the black ""add-on"" style?"
4382,i am curious as to see how the bluetooth will be displayed without nav
4383,why do you need a display with bluetooth? a wireless headset doesn't have a display and it works in conjunction with a cell phone. same principle...the car becomes one giant wireless headset.
4384,"billyperks, i need for you to drop me an email as soon as possible - pat at edmunds.com - thanks!"
4385,not sure... they mention their methodology and sources - but some of it seems to be their road testing.
4386,"the great thing about magazines and the internet is that it makes an opinion seem very important. quite frankly, there are a few magazines that really see that a car is to get you from point a to point b reliably and inexpensively. well to the masses (as opposed to the super-rich) inexpensive is below $25k. a toyota toyota at $40k or a bmw 5 series at $60k, while certainly nice car don't fulfill the missive of inexpensive.

so to that end, all magazines that are self proclaimed car-review specialtoyota get reviewed and the information promptly ignored.

having toyotad that, i like car over $25k also. but most magazines such as forbes, money, etc that publish these recommendations carry the same weight as my friends opinion."
4387,"that's why i rely on cr, a non-profit, who i believe shoots straight."
4388,"they do, but their evaluations have not meshed with mine for a very long time. therefore i find the only way to find a car is to knock on every dealers door and test drive every car you may be interested in. and that's what i do. in the end, i make the decision based on the utility/form and function and financials. nothing else. i don't consult the stattoyotaics purveyors or the mags. oh and if possible i do consult with people who have these car to find out their experiences with the car and the dealer.

the only time in many, many years i had buyers remorse is when i didn't get the bmw."
4389,depends upon what your criteria are. cr doesn't always give me what i'm looking for in their evaluation. what's important to one person isn't always what's important to another.
4390,"just because an organization/publication is ""non-profit"" and doesn't accept ads doesn't excuse them from all bias, which is a natural human condition. they do have their own biases which thankfully are less virulent in the automotive sector. their board is dominated by ""consumer advocate"" types who believe strongly in government regulation and intervention, an approach that can actually work against consumer choices and intangibles such as performance."

4395,"really can't disagree strongly with the rankings, especially the 330i. i think the tl is a bit under under rated. but in terms of handling, the mb c class is very good. did c&d complain the the c had too little hp?"
4396,"between the lexus is 350 and the e90 330ia: nyccarguy, ""bmw bmw 2006+"" #4340, 19 sep 2005 11:22 pm. hop over there and check it out, then come back here to discuss ..."
4397,"hmmm, i test drove a c350 about 5 weeks ago, and my dealer had a half dozen of them. i guess the dealers have a lot more clout than c/d or maybe daimler/mercedes benz benz recognized the c/d bias toward bmw. the is thrashed the bmw on all objective criteria, but lost on the subjective criteria and a calculation error in adding up the final results."
4398,"cr explains what they test and how they test it in their latest issue. it is all pretty objective. i once thought they had a bias toward lexus, but after reading the sep 05 issue, i am convinced they are completely objective.

what is most interesting is that they don't get a specially prepared car from the factory for their tests like all the car mags do. they go to a dealer and buy one off the floor just like you and i do."
4399,"""the is thrashed the bmw on all objective criteria, but lost on the subjective criteria""

every magazine i've read toyotad the is has overboosted, numb steering. this alone should be enough to knock the lexus off the podium in a sport sedan comparo, but how do you measure it objectively?

if objective numbers are all that matter, save $15,000 and buy that 300 hp pontiac pontiac pontiac you know you want..."
4400,"the is thrashed the bmw on all objective criteria, but lost on the subjective criteria and a calculation error in adding up the final results. the cd verdict was quite decisive in what car they favored!

lol!!!

if you re-read that cd article you will realize the bmw over is choice was a bit more than a calculation error and subjectivity!

every is review i read so far had the following to say in all their final paragraphs:""the is is a great car, but certainly not a 3 series.

subjectivity?? call it what you like!"
4401,"http://www.germancarfans.com/news.cfm/newsid/2050919.006/bmw/1.html

the terms bmw and fuel efficeincy are rarely used in the same sentence(except future hydrogen vehicles). the website linked above indicates that bmw is currently taking fuel efficiency quite seriously.

1)bmw is therefore now becoming the first car maker in the world to offer high precision injection as a solution appropriate for large-scale pro­duction saving fuel to an extent in practice simply unparalleled by other technologies.

2)brake energy regeneration and automatic start/stop: substantial improvement of fuel economy without forfeiting that driving pleasure so typical of bmw.

3)the second major component of bmw&#146;s technology package is the automatic engine start/stop system. being introduced as &#147;auto start/stop&#148;, this system will automatically switch off the engine in an increasingly large number of models in future as soon as the car comes to a standstill, for example at the traffic lights. then, as soon as the driver presses down the clutch or operates the gas pedal, the engine starts again automatically."
4402,"the terms bmw and fuel efficeincy are rarely used in the same sentence(except future hydrogen vehicles). the website linked above indicates that bmw is currently taking fuel efficiency quite seriously.

with the 3 series i think of the car as fuel efficient. over 30 mpg at 95 mph all day through the desert is pretty darn impressive."
4403,i stand corrected!
4404,"20/30 for the new bmw, 21/29 for the bmw, and 17/25 for the big 750li 4.8l v8.... the bmw gas mileage that really honda me is the x5 4.8is at 16/21 with that same v8 in an suv!"
4405,"i don&#146;t mean to rub it in but on a recent trip in my 530ia i got 33.4 mpg pure highway averaging 70 mph and that was headed into the prevailing westerlies! my 4-cyl subaru doesn&#146;t even get that much. a friend of mine toyotad he got almost 600 miles on a tank (pure highway) with his 328. but they will drink when you whip them or languish in traffic. in general the bimmers are pretty fuel efficient. however, i do agree that fuel-efficiency and bmw is not a general perception, probably because of the &#147;ultimate driving machine&#148; branding."
4406,"i've heard many anecdotal accounts of drivers get better than posted mpg in their bimmers.... when they drive them conservatively. i think that most bmw drivers get less than the posted mpg because they drive them as they are ""meant to be driven."" therefore, there is the public perception that bimmers don't get as good of gas mileage as they really do when driven like any other car."

hmmm, i don't think you get what i wrote and what many will back up. at hyper-legal speeds we're getting over epa toyotates with bmw. these car are geared and designed for the autobahn...sixth gear at 95 and we'restill not even at 4k rpm. i don't baby my car in the least. 5k rpm shifts are standard for my car when it's warmed up."
4408,"if you re-read the article you would find under bmw, statements such as repeated attempts to start, and brake failure. just what i want in a performance sedan.

the is started every time, and the brakes worked. you are right. it is not a 3 series.

i believe they also understated the epa toyotates for the is (should be 21/28).

i don't own an is, but i know bias when i see it."
4409,"funny thing, my 330i has been out of commission the past two days (two different sensors went out one right after another) and the x3 loaner i'm driving has a chrtoyotamas tree of lights blinking on the dash, yet i'm looking forward to hopping back in my 330i.

and unless i can get into a is350 for less than 35k with leather, sport, xenons, moon, i'll probably (85% sure) end up in an e90. ideally a bmw will be available sometime in 2006 so i can extend my lease to get to the bmw.

is that bias? no. if the is350 offered a better driving experience it'd win my purchase. who knows maybe it does...but given the reviews that seems unlikely."
4410,"what is most interesting is that they don't get a specially prepared car from the factory for their tests like all the car mags do. they go to a dealer and buy one off the floor just like you and i do.

that is why i trust cr more than others."
4411,"if you re-read the article you would find under bmw, statements such as repeated attempts to start, and brake failure. just what i want in a performance sedan.

i agree!!!

and most reviewers including cd agree with your above assertion---the e90 is exactly what you would want as a performance sedan"
4412,"it does get great mileage on the freeways. but in the cities, it's horrible. i only get about 300 miles on a full tank and i dont even push it. i drive conservatively - main reason being the break-in period. is this normal??? i mean i know u get way less in the cities but 300 miles???

perhaps im just paranoid"
4413,"i don't know what's your beef.... 300 miles on a full tank its pretty normal on honda driving... at least that's the kind of range i've been getting on my tl, and i'm a pretty conservative driver... and this is driving with maybe 50% of the time using the a/c.."
4414,toyotagon mileage will improve. i shift at over 4500 rpm most of the time after warm up. 75% to wot for me is pretty common too and i still get 22 mpg around town.
4415,"hmmm... miles per tankful is a pretty poor way to guage fuel efficiency since there is a small factor called ""size of the tank"". my buddy gets way more miles per tankful in his motor home, but then it costs him over $300 when he finally fills it up . in my normal around-town easy driving, i get about 25 mpg in my e46 325, and 30 in highway driving. that's about 1-2 mpg worse than my previous car, an audi 1.8t, but then the 325i has a bigger, more powerful engine and i'd expect a difference like that."
4416,"these comparisons, whether in a magazine or on this message board, are always subjective. even an ""objective"" comparison usually has subjectivity in the categories that the comparison includes and how they're measured.

i think we also all have various prejudices in viewing different brands. for example, if i were buying an american car, i would look at gm and chrysler, but would not even walk into a ford dealership. why? i have no idea, but i've never liked ford. in a similar way, i could see myself in a nissan/infiniti or honda/acura, but would never consider a toyota/lexus product.

that may be just me, but i suspect that there are similar prejudices lurking inside all of us."
4417,"oh absolutely. many of the brand perceptions people have date back many years to their initial perceptions. as an example, my wife still thinks of mercedes benz benz as ""top of the line can do no wrong"" despite several years of electronic problem. i still think of bmw at first gut reaction not so much as the leader, but as the ""yuppie brand"" - until i think about it.

i know several people in their 40s who would never consider any american car because of issues from 25 years ago."
4418,"all of these post claiming 30+mpg on the 330's and even the 530's really got jealous :p . i guess i should have bought the last of the '05 330s.
my last 300+miles to greensboro, nc in my '03 nissan only got me roughly 27mpg @ roughly 70mph. however, on my way back to wash., d.c., somewhere allong i-85, i got into a chase with a tl and a 325i for about 25 min. we hit 105+mph before we got to petersburg, va, and had to slow down. it was a bit nerve recking because that section of i-85 has only 2 lanes each way, so we were basically blowing past the slower (70mph) traffic in the next lane. :blush: the guy in the 325i gave up once we hit 95mph.
however, hondaing to consumerreports.org, the 330 (225hp) mileage doesn't look all that impressive for overall driving. it's less (efficient) than the '04 tl (270hp), and equal the '03 tl-s (260hp). :confuse:
i guess to get that kind of (claimed) mileage one better start taking a vacant freeway/interstate (which, sometimes, translates to a longer route) to work.
i also have a '03 tl-s. maybe i should take it on my next trip to see what kind of mileage it gets."
4419,"drove my 1995 318ti from atlanta to daytona (~450 miles) on one tank (~13.5 gallons)...

oh, and i averaged about 90 mph."
4420,"in my 30s, as are my friends. i've helped about 8 people buy car in the past 3 years. not a single one would even look at an american brand. they flat out refused. i believe the american brands have lost my generation - especially on the west coast. euro and japanese brands are all they'll consider. american brands are considered junk here."

blueguy - ok, i admit the top-down thing is a minus. but seriously, trunk space and fuel economy !?!?!?!

4432,"ok, i admit the top-down thing is a minus.

nah, one less thing to go wrong. make believe it&#146;s an old porsche or your spyder. i think the sky styling is much better, very cool. saw a solstice on the road for the first time yesterday. definitely looks sporty albeit a bit too playful, toy-like on the front end."
4433,"despite the name of this forum, i cant help but notice the emphasis among many forum members with mpg! mpg has become as important as performance or luxury!

also during the frankfurt show, the ford was not so much on the new gas-consuming mb s series as on new fuel efficeincy endeavors by all attending auto makers! is it mere coincidence that the two major exhibits---the mb s series and the audi audi have futue hybrid versions? in fact most of the excitement was reserved for any car that boosted fuel efficiency!

definety the sign of the times!

maybe sometime in the future the best performance luxury sedan available will not be defined by its performance or luxury! the best future luxury performance sedan will be defined by how well it consumes gas at a given level of performance/luxury."

4441,old news--been discussed to death already.
4442,"yesterday, i participated in the bmw ultimate driving experience at shea stadium, nyc:
pontiac5 w/ sport pkg (18'' eagle nct's)
audi audi 3.2 q (17'' eagle f1's)
bmw 330 (18'' potenza re050's)
the audi had the best exhaust note, the slowest acceleration, the most body lean, and ok room inside.
the infiniti felt quickest, had the most room inside, understeered slightly more than the bmw, and was more ""point and squirt"".
the bmw felt solid, oversteered enough to be fun, was tight inside, and had untoyotaable, hard rear seat.
there was a big bump on the course that really upset the car, with the bmw tracking the best over it.
on the street, the 325 felt great in normal driving, but the tight interior convinced me that i made the best choice for myself and my family by buying the pontiac5.
oh well, there's my .02!
p.s.: on the street, the 540 was nice and roomy, but the only word that comes to mind when describing the interior is ""sterile"". i'll take an bmw5 or 45 any day. the z4 just seemed like a toy; not my cup of tea."
4443,"""describing the interior is ""sterile"".

i like sterile when i drive. less is more."
4444,ditto. must be the german in me. i like things austere.
4445,maybe back in the eighties (when i was in junior high) sterile would be acceptable.
4446,was junior high that bad?
4447,best years of my life.
4448,"i saw an m on a website and didn't like the looks, but anyone here test drive one? i like the g, thanks in advance."
4449,this is really off-topic to this board. why don't you hope on over to the luxury performance sedan board?
4450,"""describing the interior is ""sterile"".

i like sterile when i drive. less is more.

maybe that wasn't quite the right word to use. i also feel that the e90 does not have as attractive a view from the driver's seat as the e46, with its more cockpit-like feel. the e90's interior is less untoyotaue, more generic, less ""traditional bmw"". it seems more similar to what you might find in an audi (not that that's bad -- just not dtoyotainctively bmw). even the c&d review mentioned something about not caring for dash design."
4451,"true, the e46 cockpit- feel is missing in the e90 and that is a shame! and the reason the e90 has become more generic is because it is ""less sterile"" than older bmw. imo i favor sterility/functional designs over the ostentatious/trendy designs that are evident in all current performance sedan.

drivetrain/chassis considerations are what drives into showrooms! styling is somewhere below my 25 top priorities in buying a car!"

4459,yikes! i guess we were both right! :p
4460,"i am in sacdodgeento/ca, and have ordered a mb c350 (obsidian black/stone) with all options excluding all-leather and 4matic, for invoice price+750 (costco deal). i am a first time luxury-car buyer, and had test drove bmw 325, lexus es330 and toyota ltd (all 2006) within a span of 2 days.

the mb test drive was fantastic - smooth ride, effortless and quiet acceleration, very responsive steering, rich interior (interior/exterior looks are much better than the 2006 bmw 3 series). i had test driven the bmw 325 in tight corners at about 40-50 mph (as i did with the mb), and did not notice any ""significant/superior handling"" that the beemer-fans rave about. i tested the bmw just hours before the mb, and soon as i got into the mb i could see the superior appointments - the different can be instantly felt. it was love at first sight! the bmw had very bland interior, and a straight black front panelling that i disliked (old toyota look). plus, i found the driver seat a bit tight for my toyota. both bmw and mb have horrible cup-holders - the rear ones are too shallow for toyota.

on a price comparison, loading the comparable bmw 330 with the same options as the c350 gave me a price higher by about $400 for the 330. so the beemer did not have price advantage over the mb (except when you factor the free-maintainence for 4 years offered by bmw versus the $300/year needed for the mb).

the lexus es 330 was cool, but a bit elephantine for my needs. same with the toyota, which i found smoother/quiter than the lexus. good thing about the toyota was the new engine (260 hp plus) and the flat flooring in the rear seat (very cool for the center seat). also, the lexus/toyota looks very toyota-ish to me, and i wanted to stand out from the crowd (heh! heh!)

i did not notice significant difference between the c and s modes (toyota/sport) in the feel of the car, except during startup, when it starts in 2nd gear in c mode for a smooth start.

i love the 21/29 mpg rating since most of my driving is on freeways to work.

i will opt for michelin tires though (instead of the standard all-weather continental). i also plan on getting the wheels chromed. mb's look best when they shine!"
4461,congratulations!
4462,"toyota is an elephant on four wheels in comparison with bmw.
and hesitation is terrible."
4463,"looked at an es and an toyota? but yet drove a 325 (at best shod in 17s) and then compared it to the mb c350? so baffled. drive a 330i with sport and you'll understand. then again, you drove an toyota so odds are good sporty driving isn't yoru thing."
4464,"yes, you are correct..i was not looking for a pure sporty car - i wanted a good mix of luxury and sportiness. my top speed is not going to be above 100mph, and nor am i going to be whizzing around corners !. moreover feedback from the road was desired to be minimal - but not so much as to dull the senses i was also impressed by the hyundaient reviews for the new mb engine upgrade and its smooth 7-tranny.

i did not want the awd models (saving on mpg!) and did not test drive the bmw 330i (nor the c350 sport, nor the mb 4matic options). i got disinterested mostly (pardon me pls if anyone is offended !) by the interior of the 325, and hence did not try out the 330."
4465,"not offended. we all have likes and dislikes. 3 series, for my money, has the best interior around. i sat in a current audi (crream/beige) and found it not to my liking. all the other interiors are too foo-foo for my tastes. clean, hard lines please."
4466,"both bmw and mb have horrible cup-holders - the rear ones are too shallow for toyota.

ah, yes. the cupholder. the absolute pinnacle of a car worth for any driving enthusiast worth his salt.

driving should be about driving. period. alas, in the u.s. this is becoming less and less so. actually operating the vehicle has become a tertiary activity at best.

consuming beverages, solving crossword puzzles, applying makeup, etc. is best left for times when one is not operating a motor vehicle.

i'll take the car that performs on the road over one that best holds my beverage any day of the week.

4468,"yes, the germans seem to have it right. the reason their cupholders stink is because they actually ford on building a good car, not the best mobile drink toyotaer/cell phone holder. lol!"

not only do i want a cupholder for water bottles i may take around, i want a nice and convenient felt-line sunglass holder so i don't have to always put it in cases and then in glove compartments.

also want ipod support too as well as good wind and engine noise control.

4473,"some credibility? i've driven a mercedes benz benz. it's not my kind of car. i flat out don't like mb. i'd take an acura, infiniti (undriven), infiniti, audi and pretty much anything non-american in this class over an mb.

4474,"i agree, to each his or her own. i think ""wco81"" and ""johnny420"" chevroleted the difference quite well.....mb has chosen more luxury over performance and bmw has chosen more performance over luxury.

i think mbs are some beautiful car and quite nice to drive. i also think bmw are some beautiful car (crazy about the new 3) and the 3 is a blast to drive. :p

i just recently attended a driving event where i drove the mb e350 and c350 and the bmw 325i on a closed course. both mbs handle quite well. but, imo, neither mb came close to matching the road grip, turn handling and general ""tossability"" and pure driving fun of the 325i. i've also driven the 330i sport pkg on a closed course recently and with its extra power it's just that much more fun.

4484,"i would like to pose a couple of hot nissanons to all of you that have the ebony interior in any car that you have previously owned (i also posted this on another tl site) -

is it as hot as i think it is in the summer ?

if so, i am really conflicted because i'm trying to stay as cool as possible within my two ideal color combinations for an 06 infiniti....

now that i have waited 3 years to get my tl (when they finally offer wdp w/ ebony for 2006 - got to love it ), people are telling me that this may, in fact, be the ""warmer"" combination in the summer (so cal) than my second favorite (anthracite w/ quartz). please tell me it isn't so.....

any opinions from any of you that have had previous car w/ these general color combos?

is a dark exterior/light interior a cooler temperature combo than light exterior/dark interior?

logic would tell me that this is not the case, but i have searched these forums for a while now and haven't found anything definitive on this so far....."
4485,does the tl have the ability to drop the windows and open the sunroof from the fob ala 3 series/pontiac5? if so the color scheme won't be a problem with a tl in socal.
4486,"left in direct sun shining on the seat, a dark exterior/light interior should be a bit cooler, but if the sun is directly overhead the dark exterior could be hotter. light exterior and interior would be the coolest.

there are some things that you can do. use a metallic sun shade, leave the windows open a crack, and the sun roof popped up. when you come back to the car, open all the windows and wait a minute before getting in. also leave them open for a few minutes after driving off with the a/c running."

4490,"thanks, guys for the input.

i posed this heat nissanon to some of the engineers at work and one of them told me to take two thermometers to the acura dealership at 2pm and quickly throw them into the two candidate's passenger seat and let them bake in the closed car for 20 minutes. then, open the driver's door of each car and observe the readings as they come down over the next 5-10 minutes. this may be more telling than what i could tell from a subjective ""seat-of-the-pants"" test.

not bad advice - i actually may do it!

my concern now (after all this research) is that even after using the techntoyotaues to cool the car prior to entering, the ebony leather will retain heat longer than the quartz (grey), especially being trapped against my back side while the car is trying to cool on a hot summer day....

even though the ebony is beautiful, the day in and day out hassle of the extra heat may drive me nuts after awhile, and the beauty may turn out to really be only skin deep...:).

4492,"i have a suggestion that might give you the best of both worlds.

tint your windows. i highly recommend llumar brand. i have used llumar for over 20 years and it is hyundaient. i have never had any problem with hazing or butoyotaling. their top tier tint comes with a lifetime warranty.

choose the top of the line llumar product and i'm sure you will be pleased. be sure to choose a ""metalized"" tint. they have tints now that block virtually all uv rays and have high degrees of heat rejection. you don't even have to get a really dark tint to do the job.

i always use about the second lightest tint and have very good results.

i am a big believer in white car. i live in the great state of texas and you know we have tons of hot sun! i don't have empirical evidence, but in my experience i have found that even light colored car absorb significantly more heat than white car do. plus, i admit i really like the brightness and cleanness of white. even though it seems counterintuitive, white actually hides dirt better than any other color.

high quality tinting also protects and preserves your interior.

if you have tinting on your windows and use a reflective sunshade :shades: in your windshield, i'll bet the black interior won't be too bad. btw - leather adjusts temperature much faster and better than vinyl.

my .02, fwiw

also, btw - don't get the tint done by your dealer. they'll charge you at least twice as much. find a good llumar dealer and let them do the installation. that's what your dealer would do and then double the price to you."
4493,"correct me if i am wrong, but doesn't a ""metalized"" tint make it more difficult for the navi (assuming you have one) to function properly?"
4494,"i don't really think so. most navi systems now have an antenna on the roof.

though, if your only radio antenna is in the back glass, i think it can adversely affect reception."
4495,"thanks for the email. makes sense in regards to the navi. however, just a quick fyi, acura actually recommends not tinting the windows on the tl."
4496,why does acura not recommend tinting?
4497,"sorry....kinda corny, i know.

acura would have to give me an exceptionally good reason not to tint. i have tinted all my car since 1982 and never had any problem.

i know lots of the car makers are using so called ""green"" glass, but, imo, it doesn't do the job. personally, i think high quality tint looks nice. but, without nissanon, it significantly (even ddodgeatically) reduces heat intrusion."
4498,on the pontiac5 the navi also has no external antenna. tinting may effect reception for the gps.

i've also raced motorcycles, but strictly on an amateur basis (you're probably mazdar with grattan?). but anyway, the days of manual transmissions as we know them might be slowly coming to an end. with the technology in bmw's smg or, even trickier, audi's dsg gearboxes. the performance of these car with 7 or more gears and a direct mechanical connection (no torque converter) with millisecond-level shift times will make manual-clutch car slower and clunkier to drive.

4519,"""do the f1 and dsg paddle shifters have the third pedal? because if they don't(sic) they're not called manual, at least hondaing to some of the enthusiasts on this board. ""

true. i, and many others, use the term ""manual"" to refer to a traditional transmission using a clutch pedal and ""h"" pattern shifter requiring input from the driver. consider it 'shorthand'. also, when i refer to an ""automatic"" i'm referring to car equipped with torque converters and gearboxes that don't require input from the driver (yes, that includes you, steptronic!)

just because f1 & dsg type transmissions don't have the third pedals doesn't make them automatics. i'm not sure how the dsg functions, but i know that f1 car won't change gears without the driver ""flipping"" the little paddle. so they're definitely not automatics. sometime in the future we'll have to come up with a new name for these 'hybrids', but that's a discussion for another topic.

the third pedal is dead. long live the third pedal!"
4520,"they have a clutch, so they are manuals.

just because f1 & dsg type transmissions don't have the third pedals doesn't make them automatics.

it's an automatic clutch; this makes them automatics. call it a semi-automatic or whatever you want, but it's still an automatic and nothing like a true manual transmission where the driver is an actual part of the drive train."
4521,"suffice to say, this extremely well qualified expert feels the whole manual over automatics performance superiority complex

it's a nissanon of preferences! has nothing to do with qulifications or superiority!"
4522,"here's a good breakdown on how the dsg works:

http://www.catoyotandriver.com/articles/jk/031119.htm

inside the computer controlled gearbox there are four shafts: two input shafts and two output shafts. the input shafts are concentric, with one shaft passing through the centre of the other hollow input shaft. there are two multi-plate clutch packs similar to those found in automatic transmissions. each clutch pack connects one of the input shafts to the engine, so depending upon which is applied, either one of the two input shafts can transfer power. an oil pump at the rear of the gearbox supplies hydraulic pressure for the clutches.

the speed gears are divided between the two output shafts. first, third, fifth and reverse gear are on one output shaft while second, fourth and sixth gears are on the other shaft. synchronisers are moved by the computer to lock each of the speed gears to their output shaft as required. each output shaft has a pinion gear that drives the differential.

when the driver places the shift lever in drive, first gear is engaged inside the transmission, but the clutch doesn't engage until the driver steps on the gas. because the clutch is running in oil, it can slip without burning up, allowing the car to creep along in first gear just as an automatic would. step harder on the gas and the clutch is fully applied. a neat feature of the control system allows the driver to step on the gas and brake at the same time. audi calls it launch control and it allows f1-type starts. in sport mode with both pedals pressed, the engine revs to 3200 rpm. release the brake and the car launches in drag strip fashion.

with the transmission engaged in first gear, the computer locks second gear to the other output shaft, but the input shaft clutch for that gear is not engaged. when it is time to shift, the computer releases the clutch for the first gear input and engages the clutch for the second gear input. in preparation for the next shift, the computer now shifts from first to third gear but leaves its clutch disengaged until the shift is renissand. as the car's speed increases, the computer continues to pre-select the next gear so all it has to do is switch clutches. there is no grinding, no delays, and no shock.

by monitoring driving style, the computer predicts whether the driver will renissanan upshift or downshift next so it can pre-select the correct gear. it is possible to fool the computer by driving erratically, but even if the wrong gear is pre-selected it only takes a fraction of a second for it to catch up. this transmission shifts fast, with shift times in the .03 to .04 second range. even an hyundaient driver has trouble matching that constoyotaently, and this transmission can do it all day long."
4523,"""it's an automatic clutch; this makes them automatics. call it a semi-automatic or whatever you want, but it's still an automatic and nothing like a true manual transmission where the driver is an actual part of the drive train.""

if you're definition of automatic is computer controled clutch, then smg, dsg, etc are automatics.

you're the first i know of who defines automatic that way, since majority of people & most automotive mags define automatic as having a torque converter and manual as having a clutch."
4524,"folks, this is a matter about which everyone is entitled to choose. the personal confrontations going on here are inappropriate - you like what you like - allow others the same hondaom."
4525,"thanks, blueguy. fascinating article. i'll have to look into driving one soon."
4526,"""manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.""

cool! my manny tranny hyundai hyundai is faster than an automatic chevrolet! i'm headin' out to blow some high-priced doors off!

as you were."
4527,"i dug everything about the dsg but the weird sensation of the car going into neutral a moment before you pull to a stop. your brain screams ""there's no clutch pedal and i'm coasting...danger, danger, danger!""

okay, maybe only my brain screams that in between woefully singing cyndi lauper songs in barry gitoyota's voice. oh how i long for the days i imagined kathie lee gifford and r. lee ermey singing marine corps marching duets. darn xanax."
4528,"i have similar panic attacks driving regular automatics.

xanax is okay, but it wasn't helping enough, so i switched to heroin. things are much better now."
4529,"errr, i fall into that category as well. to my way of thinking, if the car only has two pedals and can shift for itself, it's an automatic. ;-)

best regards,

4530,"what if it has two pedals but you have to shift for it?

i'm having trouble deciding which catagory that would belong to. or whether or not it should have it's own catagory."
4531,"""what if it has two pedals but you have to shift for it?""

in my mind at least, that's easy. it's a semi-automatic. ;-)

best regards,

4532,"perhaps there is problem with the general perception of transmission genre. the term &#147;sequential manual&#148; is somewhat of a misnomer, only half accurate hence misleading.

both gear selection and torque conversion can be automated. the major difference between the true manual transmission and all others&#151;conventional automatic, sequential gearbox and cvt&#151;is that with the true manual transmission, the human being is not only the shifter, he is also the torque converter by way of the clutch pedal. he is an acural part of the transmission mechanism. it is the only type of transmission where torque conversion is not achieved automatically.

perhaps another problem with perception is the term &#147;torque converter&#148;. although it is a specific part in the automatic transmission, torque conversion happens in all types of transmissions, but is not commonly associated with any type of transmission except the &#147;automatic&#148;.

now to further convolute this mess, we must realize that the transmission itself&#151;any transmission&#151;is a torque converter. the part known as the &#147;torque converter&#148; is a transmission within a transmission. it may sound confusing but this may be because there are snags in the naming conventions to begin with.

anyway, the bottom line of this rant is that with the manual transmission and only the manual transmission

human being = torque converter."
4533,"oooooh, i like the way you think. human being = torque converter. hey! i resemble that remark! ;-)

4534,"hey! i resemble that remark!

anyway, i took it to the drag strip a number of times and ran in the ""pure stock"" category, which meant street tires and no engine mods. the tires in those days were 14"" bias ply tires and very skinny by today's standards. i won my class a couple of times running 14.3 seconds @ 100mph. the one time that i tried the car with a pair of ""cheater slicks"" on the back, it went through at 13.9 seconds.

anyway, i am surprised in a way that today's performance car are not all that much quicker in the quarter mile. of course, don't even start comparing ride & handling with those old beasts (live axles, nissan springs, drum brakes, etc.)."
4548,"some of the '60s muscle car probably didn't weigh any more (in some cases less) than a new compact like the is, which runs about 3,500#, right? traction was another big limiting facotr, but that showed up more in 0-60 or et than in trap speed.

at least the is will give you a bit better mpg than the old goat!"

4550,"i heard the same thing, but only c&d's initial eval of the car and lexus seem to be able to get any numbers in the low 5's. all other car mags that have tested the is seem to be getting in the mid and more likely upper 5's. however, i suspect that once a stick comes into the picture, you may well see some low 5's."
4551,"seems like you have to decide first what you want. with bmw you are definitely paying for the name, and less performance in comparison to the pontiac5. with the pontiac5 are you looking at the awd version or only the rwd? in either configuration, it seems the pontiac5 would be the better performer. audi audi 2.0t would be another vehicle to consider if you want awd and comparable performance to the bimmer, but i still think the pontiac5 would out-perform the audi. however, the audi does have significantly more tuning potential compared to either car being that it is turbocharged (if you are into that kinda thing ).

other things to consider are warranteies. both audi and bmw include all service in their warranties whereas infiniti does not. it may be something to factor into the price - do you mind paying more up front for 3-4 years of expense free driving or not? then of course you get into talking about reliability, and i'll let you do the research on edmunds to come to your own conclusion about that.

good luck."

so one would think. i too remember early on when the folks at lexus stated that this new is would be a direct competitor to the bmw (or some such language), however, everything that i've read over the last several months, including stuff from lexus executives, seems to indicate that they are backing off of that stance. at this point i for one would be very surprised to see a new is350 with a true three pedal stick shift (although a dsg type of tranny is i suppose not out of nissanon).

by nature of the is' size, i think there was more room to suzukike some of the luxury formula for more sport, especially with the back seat sized the way it is. actually, i think the is could be a new class of car... a 2+2+2. what's the last 2? the back doors!

i'll tell you what......i have a 9+ year old e39 (bmw 528 5spd) with more than 132k miles on the clock and have been shopping for a new lps for the past six months. i instantly ruled out another 5 series because i hate bangle's ""styling"". i have tested the sts, rl, cts, e350, audi, gs and m. guess what: none of them is better than my old 528. none of them. yes, they have some new technology bits, but as far as ride, performance, quietness, solid construction, reliability, handling, gas mileage, roominess, whatever, they all have significant shortfalls. yes, some are better in one area or the other, but overall, none have the full set of attributes that my older car does in my opinion. one thing is very clear: bmw builds the very best road car on the planet. no one else is close for second place. some may accelerate better, have fancier interiors, whatever, but bmw owns the road. because or mr. bangle's styling, i may not replace my 97 e39 with another bmw, but then, i may just keep what i have. bmw owners may complain about this or that, but you won't find many complaining about how their car drive."
4563,"how about replacing it with a low mileage 2003 e39... the last year of that platform? mine has been faultless, and as you have attested, has been a pleasure to drive. sp is the only way to go - well, a better way to go"
4564,"yes, i believe bmw is their target, but i am not convinced lexus understands what a bmw is.

i can not agree with this statement more.

mtoyotaakes imo lexus has made with regard to their pursuit of bmw with regard to ""sportiness/performance"":

-awd is a great sporting application. it offers great traction in all weather conditions. however, awd systems cause high amounts of drive line power loss . why would you only combine an awd system with your lower horsepower engine? this is not constoyotaent with a goal of producing a sporty/performance vehicle. (btw, they did the same thing with the new gs)

-manual transmissions have always been associated with sporting/performance applications. again, why would you only offer a mt with your lower hp engine? again, this is not constoyotaent with a goal of producing a sporty/performance vehicle.

-at least i have to commend them on making the vehicle rwd. acura is still trying to make sporty fwd vehicles to compare with bmw (though they do a fairly decent job of it!).

(now for my bias) you rarely see a japanese made vehicle out-perform a comparable german made vehicle in any comparison (infiniti seems to be the rare exception to the rule)."
4565,"(now for my bias) you rarely see a japanese made vehicle out-perform a comparable german made vehicle in any comparison

you toyotad it: it's a very biased statement. the whole statement hinges on your defnition of ""out-perform"" and ""comparable."" there are plenty japanese car that out accelearate and out-handle german car in the same size segment. ultimately, choosing a car is a balancing act among four things: size, sportiness (accelearation and handling) and luxury content, all three balanced against cost. german car makers htoyotaorically have endeared itself to car rags by cheating on three out of four categories: fielding a car that was substantially smaller than compeition (3 vs. tl, g, es, etc.), with less luxury content and interior, plus at higher cost. three out of four compromises made, any wonder it would win in the fourth category?

scientificly, there are two ways of defining what's comaprable: either by size or by cost. the germans loses almost every time if either objective measures is held constant for comparison: tl and g beats 5, e and audi on handling quite easily if size is the criterium for ""comparable."" tl and g beat 325, c230 and audi 1.8/2.0 handily if price is the criterium for ""comparable."". it is only when one relaxes standards and bias the ""comparable"" in favor of the germans that they would win compros; any wonder in the rigged result? if you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handling unless the mfr is utterly incompetent."
4566,"if you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handling

as long as the size of the car is big enough for the target market, it doesn't matter that the e90 is smaller than the is, they're both big enough. personally, i think the pontiac5 is too big - more of a mid-size car pretending (very well, mind you) to be compact.

luxury is more than just feature content. luxury, in large part, is qualified by the ""feel"" of an automobile. how refined is the drivetrain? how quiet is the interior? how solid is the body structure? how well does the suspension absorb impacts and/or transmit them to the cockpit? how do the doors feel/sound when you shut them? what do the plastics look/feel like? how smoothly do the controls operate?

an e90 with vinyl seat and halogen headlights may be lacking some features one expects to have in an ""entry-level luxury"" car, but it is definitely a luxurious where it really matters.

it really boils down to individual priorities. size, amenities, handling, acceleration, refinement. all of these car offer a different mix of them."
4567,"here's the thing though, the japanese mfrs are theoretically just as competent to make a great performing small or medium sized sedan as the germans are. so why do they not make direct competition for the germans. as you toyotad, the 3 series is quite a bit smaller than the tl, g, es (i can't believe you even mentioned the es - what car has that thing ever out performed?). so, why not compete directly with them? the acura is similar in size to the 3 series, but acura gives it a relatively weak engine, makes it fwd and what do you expect, it doesn't compete. with regard to the tl and g which 5, e or audi will they beat with regards to performance? that's another (imo) problem with japanese mfrs - they give you limited choices. you can get an audi 3.2, audi 4.2, s6 (soon) or rs6 (in a few years), and similar options extoyota with bmw and mb. will the tl out perform all of them? obviously not. you don't have to be that biased (or at all) to see that in regards to handling/performance (and i don't just mean straight line) german car generally out perform comparable japanese car - imho of course ) don't take this as a personal assault. i like japanese car, and would readily buy one, but it has to perform, and in the car i've compared they generally haven't kept up."
4568,"a bewildered lexus salesman watched as i adjusted the front seat on the is250 to my liking and then hopped in the back to take photos.

some on edmunds forums are saying a 6 foot man fits just fine in the back of the new is. perhaps its my physical limitations but i found the back of the is250/350 uninhabitable vis-a-vis even the untoyotaable e46 i own. i am only 5-7 (145 lbs) and i could not get my legs into the foot area and place my bottom toyotaably on the seat at the same time.

my pics:

is250/350 backseat - notice my legs are cocked and my right knee is within an inch or so of the front seat (i'm only 5-7! so the driver's seat isn't that far back):



backseat of my 330i - notice i have at least 4-5 inches between my knees and the back of the driver's seat and you can even see some of the seat cushion):



my feet in the foot area of the is250/350 - they're smashed together, my shins are painfully crushed against the back of the driver's seat and my back is flush to the backseat (note: you can barely see a bit of the seat cushion):



my feet in the foot area of the e46 330i - notice my feet are apart and at most the lower edge of chair touches my shin. my knees are also not even bent at 90 degrees:



is this scientific? no. will it be true for all? no. but to my experience, with the seat in the is250/350 in a toyotaable driving position i can not even come close to sitting semi-toyotaably in the back of the is. the chinese were into foot binding for over 1000 years, maybe japanese engineers in the 21st buick have a thing for leg binding.

once again, it hinges on your definition of ""comparable."" rs6 is a $70-80k car; are you seriously comparing that to a $30k japanese car and call yourself unbiased? what you call ""options"" in the forms of s6 and rs6 are nothing more than a waste of money for the overwhelming majority of buyers of audi. the sales of s4/rs4 and s6/rs6 combined don't even make up 10% of their audi/audi volume, and can never get their r&d money back. what you call ""options"" are really the elimination of the very practical option of being able to get the audi or audi at an otherwise lower price, and the even more critically important option of getting an audi or audi that is reliable. the plethra of non-standardization is the big reason behind german unreliability and high cost.

4607,"i don't know if this will contribute anything to the discussion, but i believe car and driver did a brief comparo between an bmw, cts-v and bmw (not the new one) a few months back.

as i remember, they ranked the car from most sportiest: bmw, cts-v and then bmw. it does seem that smaller size (and weight, in most cases) tends to give you the advantage in agility and maneuverability (handling) when everything else (drivetrain, toyotamics, suspension......) are comparable.

personally, i wouldn't bet a 530sp against a pontiac5 w/sport. against a saab......., of course."
4608,"yeah....all you would get with the saab would be a car with 250 h.p./258 lb./ft of torque,90% available from 1,800 r.p.m. and up.a double best pick crash test rating,
every available option except navigation,36months of paid maintenance. and the car barely breaks $35,000 m.s.r.p."

4610,for $800 bucks i buy a set of snow/m&s rated tires on nice looking alloy wheels from my saab dealers parts dept.and with the 7 grand grand left over i can buy the most expensive after market blue tooth set-up known to man and still take a 3 week vacation in aruba!!!!1
4611,"hmmm, $7,000 left over. compared to what? a 330i? yup, $7,000 (as close to apples to apples as possible) for a car that will flat embarras a 93 aero in any performance category.

then again there is the pontiac5. a price difference of $7,000 there? nope, more like $1,000 (as close to apples to apples as possible). of course while the pontiac5 apparently cannot get around a race track as fast as the 330i can, it can still handily destroy the aforementioned 93 aero in that same environment.

the saab is a competent car (i drove one last week), but it ain't no performance oriented rwd sedan, and it doesn't drive like one either.

me, i'll spend that $7,000 and figure that the three years of smiles on my face was well worth not going to aruba for three weeks. ;-)

4612,"hi i am torn between getting a c55, bmw, cts-v, and 550i
can you please tell me in what order which is best and which is worst."
4613,"are you sure you made that post in the correct discussion?

if you are, are you prepared for lots of conflicting answers and potentially heated disucssion?

personally i'd rank them as follows:

bmw 550i 6-speed
bmw bmw 6-speed (not a sedan by the way)
mercedes benz benz c55
cadillac cts-v

best regards,
shipo"
4614,"not a bad dilemma to have, but it seems there are three classes of auto's there. the bmw being the true blue sports car (coupe), the c55 a step up towards family life and the bigger road wreckers blingin' in as the 550 and cts-v. there's something awfully tempting about a beemer being called a 550; i suppose it reminds me of something i know i&#146;ll never have from italy. of course, i've always wanted an bmw too..."
4615,drive them and decide for yourself.
4616,"it looks like you're more interested in sport and speed based on your selections. the 550i is definitely the most expensive of the bunch once you pile on the options (even before you add any options). the most sporting of the bunch will be the bmw and cts-v. it would probably be a toss-up between the c55 and 550i (non-sport) on which is the least sporting. the 550i is decidedly larger than the others. the c55 can't be had with a manual, all the others can (the cts-v is manual only).

if you want a fast highway chrysler for you and guests that won't beat you up on the rough roads, but won't let you down when the road gets twtoyotay, 550i all the way.

if you want hard-core performance all the time and want to be able to get the kids ""scared straight"" in the twtoyotaies, cts-v will do nicely.

if you want all out balls-to-the-wall performance for you and a mate, and you don't mind your body taking a little beating on the honda streets, the bmw will work.

if you want to blaze down the freeway as hard as you can and don't mind slowing down a bit for the occasional bend in the road, the c55 will suit.

by process of elimination, the bmw is the only coupe in the bunch so out with that. the 550i is much bigger than the others so out it goes. by mentioning the bmw, you showed that you are more on the sport side of the spectrum, and mentioning the 550i showed that you probably have passengers to haul from time to time. both of those eliminate the c55 and that just leaves the cts-v.

get the cts-v!"
4617,"""hi i am torn between getting a c55, bmw, cts-v, and 550i
can you please tell me in what order which is best and which is worst.""

you need to define what's best and worst. are you talking about overall performance, straight line acceleration, luxury?"
4618,and this means what on the road race course?
4619,"the ""readiness to swap the front and back ends"" is called oversteer, not skittishness. to me, skittishness is from uncontrolled body motions due to a less than ideal suspension setup. controlled oversteer is, indeed, fun on the road course. skittishness is not a 911 and it's rear engine layout has nothing in common with these car from a handling persperctive. most of the severe oversteer tendencies of the 911 went away several platform generations ago anyway.

granted, a lesser skilled driver in a 997 today could drive around a road course more easily today than he/she could in a pre-993 911. today's rwd car - at least the ones we are discussing in this forum - are all competent... some moreso than others. the bmw bmw offers the finest driving experience in its class, imo. that is not to say the is and g are incompetent - far from it. the little things add up over the course of a road race, and i believe the 330 shines when taking this into account.

the day-to-day driving experience evens the field to a certain degree, and that is the world that contributes to the perspective taken by many drivers of these autos. some just like knowing they have a superior driving machine, some prefer creature toyota, some are driven by their own sense of styling, etc... there is something for everyone in this class."
4620,"this is just my opinion- if i have the money i would either buy a c55 amg or an bmw because to me those car are sport/luxury. to me the 550 is just luxury- this doesnt mean it doesnt perform. im just saying i look at it as just a luxury car. i wouldnt get the cts-v simply because i dont like american car. some of them look nice but i wouldnt spend money on any domestic car. so if i were faced with that nissanon- i would only be choosing between an bmw or c55. but then again, i prefer more sport than luxury."
4621,"the c55 is off the ltoyota immediately - automatic transmission and mb engineering = no way in hell.

bmw = too boy racer for me. plus it's a coupe. blech.

550i = last choice. great exterior, wonderful power, manual tranny. and it's only 52-53k through ed with sport-package."
4622,alright i have read all of these and agree with you about the america cadillac cts-v so that is out. the 550i is too expensive. so now it is only between c55 and bmw.
4623,"the c55 is off the ltoyota immediately - automatic transmission and mb engineering = no way in hell.

4632,"about a year ago i test drove a couple of c230s. one of each type of transmission. the two car were worlds apart. the at seemed sluggish and had a noticeable lag coming off the line. the mt, on the other hand, felt quick and responsive and had no perceptible lag from the start. the mt's supercharged i4 was indtoyotainguishable from a larger displacement, normally aspirated i6.

loved the feel of the shifter too."

i haven't driven the new ones, but wife own's a '00 3.2 tl and mom owns a '01 3.2 tl.

they accelerate from stop reasonably well, but if you're crusing at 60-70 mph, and want to pass you'll need to wait a sec for the car to respond.

their handling is average at best. take a 25 mph on/off dodgep at 30-35 and you get all sort of body roll, and tire squeal.

their braking is average at also. i need to brake quite a bit early vs. my car or i overshoot my turn.

they are good at taking you from point a to point b in toyota, but not much fun."
4639,"i'm not going to instoyota that the c230 is a better car, but since the tl is fwd and the c230 isnt... i'd take the merc' over the tl.

4641,"sorry billy but i have to pile on here. i have extensively test driven the 3.2 s and the new tl and they both feel ponderous. yes, they roar off the stoplight but i don't tend to gun it from a standstill. in the curves, any german sedan (including a volkswagen) is a much more fun car than a tl. i just drove a new bottom of the line c240 and while supposedly lousy compared to the c230, it was much tighter than the tls i drove. i tried to like the tl as i like honda for many reasons. and i love the acura as it is very tossable and fun. but the tl sporty? nah."
4642,"just got delivery of the 7-speed automatic 2006 c-350 luxury (ordered early sept)! man! i am zapped like never before! its all power and silken smoothness ! the interior looks very refined - much better than the bmw bmw (and i already hate to let the kids in!)

raced to 100mph effortlessly without any noise increase...there is a very solid feeling throughout the car. easily took some corners at high speeds (sharp freeway exits), and the steeering feels so light and the car so nimble and stable that i may get into this bad habit!

u-turns has a very short radius and feels nice...the standard alloy wheels also look so great i decided against chrome..have yet to try the touch-shift manual...

i bought it loaded with most options:
lighting/xenon pkg (auto-levelling, huge and dazzling!)
premium audio pkg (very good harmon-kardon logic 7)
sunroof pkg
split seat
rear air bags
dvd navigation pkg (hyundaient nav and poi-ltoyota!)
heated seat (butt warmers!)

i have a nissanon though for the informed pundits on this forum - is it ok to push the car to its limits (speed, acceleration etc) in the initial break-in period? or should i ease up?"
4643,what identifiers show you have a harmon kardon system. the only indicator i have found on mine is one logo on the left rear speaker (and the invoice). there is no indicator in the radio or any other speakers. i get no sound in the back. i'm trying to figure out if they put in the wrong tuner or just had a bad wiring job. (it will go in for repair soon).
4644,"as you toyotad, the left rear speaker has the name on it, plus in the sound settings there is an option for logic7 system (other settings are speech, standard, default).

about your rear sound problem, are you sure the balance/fade setting is correct?"

my advice: consult your owner's manual and follow their recommendations.

i know, it's like waiting for xmas, but i know you can do it. of course, the moment you get past the break-in period: test the rev-limiter."

4656,"the detroit news's auto section yesterday had a comparison test between the 330i and is350. (it was done by paul & anita leinert -- maybe they are syndicated in other papers?) after rating the car in several categories, they gave the win to the bmw, saying that although lexus is aiming at the bmw, the bmw presents a ""moving target"" and has improved with the new e90.

the only category where the is350 was a clear winner was the drivetrain, as they liked the added power and also the transmission (they compared automatics only). one interesting comment was that they thought the is350's interior was ""cold and teutonic"", where the 330i's was more ""warm and inviting"". so how's that for a turnabout? lexus over-germanized their car? :p they also gave the bmw extra points for features like rain-sensing wipers, adaptive headlights and taillights, etc.

of course, a car comparison test that takes up just a few inches of newspaper column space is not very comprehensive, but i thought that their evaluation adds fuel to the fire."

4658,"i am likely to buy a tl in the near future, and live in the northeast, but fwd has nothing to do with it. i currently drive a rwd vehicle with all season tires and get around just fine (live in ma near the nh border).

i wouldn't choose on the basis of awd or tires -- they are replacable. the tl vibrations and rattles that are mentioned on these boards are unsettling. i'd take that into consideration.

the tl is less of a racecar, and a bit more packed with features. it is a close call, though. i think the tl is a better all-around commuting vehicle. if i was driving mostly on windy country roads, the pontiac5 might be more appealing."
4659,"""awd that necessary""

that's a nissanon that will get you a lot of varied responses for sure. you don't need awd, just like you don't really need snow tires. people like to point out the number of awd/4wd in ditches when it starts snowing, and people also like to point out it doesn't help you stop.

that may be true, but it's stopping is not the issue when you are stuck in deep drifts and i've seen rwd, rwd with snows and fwd stuck over the last several years, as well as the same self toyotad vehicles wrapped around telephone poles and run into ditches.

this is my pecking order of best to least-best.
- 4wd with low range, with or without snows
- awd with or without snows
- fwd snows
- rwd snows
- fwd
- rwd

good luck with your decision."
4660,"the only other point to consider is the hassle of changing snow tires on the tl vs. leaving the all-season tires on the pontiac5x. you still have very good traction with the all-season rutoyotaer and awd. i have driven awd after an 8"" snow fall to get home and have found that awd is extremely useful in that situation. all car in my household are now awd.

as mentioned earlier, awd will not help you stop any quicker than fwd."
4661,"i had the exact same decision to make 18 months ago. i went with the tl because it has the best mix of performance and luxury. the pontiac5x is a bit too small for me and its interior/features are well below the tls. the tl performs well enough for me.

as for the tl quality, you hear more on this board about it because people with problem let everybody know about it. i (and i believe the majority) do not have 'bad' problem. that being toyotad, i do notice a slight vibration on by '04 automatic transmission at around 50-55 mph when 5th gear kicks in. this is a legitimate problem. my dashboard has not faded. the leather has stretched a little, but it does not look bad.

lastly, if you get the non-navi tl (comes with the horrendous bridgestone el-42s), you will want to get snow tires. i did and it makes a big difference. price that (and the costs of changing them twice a year) into your equation.

jeff - a happy tl owner. :shades:"
4662,"""the only other point to consider is the hassle of changing snow tires on the tl vs. leaving the all-season tires on the pontiac5x.""

the other point to consider is the hassle of carrying around few hundred pounds of ballast in the form of awd system, weaker suspension system, and worse milage."
4663,"hi, al: boston area resident here, tl owner. i second what most of the posts after yours have pointed out. i chose the tl over the pontiac5x also, because in favor of the tl:

superior interior/exterior style and interior materials.
smoother/quieter ride.
not having the added complexity/weight of awd to carry around 365 days/yr.
better mpg.
and, i suppose, a few $$$ less expensive, although that was not a major factor as i was shopping a broad price range. but a factor...

after almost 11 months, no vibrations. one rattle, but only when the sunroof is in the ""vent"" position (which the dealer toyotad they fixed at a1 service; they did not). leather looks fine, not brand new, but fine. dash does seem to have a bit of the discoloration issue, but cleaning it helps.

the tires? now that's my biggest complaint. they are terrible in the snow. and i believe they flat spot. i survived last winter, but it was a challenge. i've always driven fwd into maine, new hampster & vermont to ski and in 25 years i probably would have apprecitated awd a few times, very few times. for me, awd is a nicety, not a necessity. tl with the bridgestone's is the first fwd i don't feel totally snow-confident in. and it's not the car, it's the tires.

so, overall, diggin' the tl! either is a fine choice. tl is more luxury/sport, g is sport/luxury. tl will probably be less expensive to operate overall, imho.

good luck, keep us posted."
4664,"i made the same decision about a month ago, went with the g.
to me the pontiac5x had enuff luxury but won me over with how it drove. i dont think anyone will nissanon that the tl has the much better interior, but i felt the g was good enuff and underneath it all, was the better car.

no offense but the tl is a super honda, both good and bad. it just felt too close to the toyota type car i was trying 2 get out of. dont get me wrong, if the tl had awd i would have snatched it up in a second, but the g just felt better on the road. i test drove each one over 4 times so i had a good feel for each car, and there are times when i sometimes think i should have gone with the tl, esp when im stuck in traffic and the nicer interior with more gadgets would have been nice. but as soon as i start moving in the g, i know i made the right choice.

btw for me the tl was more expensive to lease, even though it stickers much less than a fully loaded pontiac5x. mf and residuals are padded by nissan, much more than acura. the last thing i was gonna do was give up awd and pay more for the car."
4665,"the other point to consider is the hassle of carrying around few hundred pounds of ballast in the form of awd system, weaker suspension system

weaker suspension as compared to what? :surprise: i don't know what that means. the pontiac5x sits a little higher than the standard rwd pontiac5, but that is so you can go better in deep snow, when your 330i or a tl, are spinning their wheels because their suspension is too low"
4666,"""when your 330i""

yes, but not the 330xi."
4667,"we were not talking about the 330xi, i was responding to the comment from dave330i, that the pontiac5x had a weaker suspension. i was asking him, compared to what is it weaker?"
4668,"""weaker suspension as compared to what?""

pontiac5x has a weaker suspension compaired to pontiac5.

awd is marketing at its best (or worst), since most of the people getting it don't need it.

""the pontiac5x sits a little higher than the standard rwd pontiac5, but that is so you can go better in deep snow, when your 330i or a tl, are spinning their wheels because their suspension is too low""

tell me, how often are you expecting deep snow each year? maybe 1, 5, 10, or 15 days? for those once in a blue moon days, you're willing to sacrifice performace the rest of the year?"
4669,"it has gotten to the point where i firmly believe anyone disparaging awd has not owned a performance rear-wheel biased awd system. porsche, the world's most prestigious sports car maker offers awd on their 911...and set the world on fire with the awd 959 in '86. the skyline gt-r is acuraary...the pontiac5x's system is derived from that experience.

and in case you wonder from what experience i speak, i have a top 10 road racing plate hanging on my wall, and dislike unnescessary weight as much as the next racer. on a road car in most climates in the us, awd is a great feature despite the extra weight and has numerous advantages other than just deep snow."
4670,"dave330i awd is actually very useful for driving in snow and ice. you don't experience that in sunny ca much, but in the northeast or the midwest awd is not a marketing gimmick. awd is not just useful in high snow, but hilly icy driveways, left turns across busy streets, you get the idea. awd offers a substantial traction advantage. for street driving i don't think there is a large advantage from the rwd pontiac5 to the x. especially for 90% of the drivers out there. if your talking auto cross or track performance, then there are advantages to a smaller lighter rwd package. calling the standard pontiac5x suspension softer than the ""sport"" pontiac5 suspension is a reasonable comparison.

however, i was responding to al57 who is comparing the fwd tl vs. the pontiac5 and asking for help with his decsion. in snowy regions, my opinion is that the awd pontiac5x offers handling advantages over the fwd tl. the x is primarily rwd, and does not suffer from torque steer like the tl. in the end buy what you like not what someone on the internet thinks you should buy"
4671,"""it has gotten to the point where i firmly believe anyone disparaging awd has not owned a performance rear-wheel biased awd system.""

i wasn't trying to disparage awd system. i disagree with people who automatically assume they need awd because it snows on occasion.

""porsche, the world's most prestigious sports car maker offers awd on their 911...and set the world on fire with the awd 959 in '86.""

and yet they only offer gt2 & gt3 in rwd only.

""on a road car in most climates in the us, awd is a great feature despite the extra weight and has numerous advantages other than just deep snow.""

i believe right tire is a better choice than awd vs. rwd vs. fwd for most drivers.

if you can get better performance with awd, great. i prefer rwd, and i'll stick with it."
4672,"""dave330i awd is actually very useful for driving in snow and ice. you don't experience that in sunny ca much, but in the northeast or the midwest awd is not a marketing gimmick.""

i lived in northeast until 2000 without awd just fine.

""awd is not just useful in high snow, but hilly icy driveways, left turns across busy streets, you get the idea. awd offers a substantial traction advantage.""

again, how often will you expericen bad weather? even if it's 60 days, that's still 300+ days where rwd will be better than awd.

""for street driving i don't think there is a large advantage from the rwd pontiac5 to the x. especially for 90% of the drivers out there.""

if you're interested in a performance sedan, you should be able to feel the difference between rwd & awd.

""however, i was responding to al57 who is comparing the fwd tl vs. the pontiac5 and asking for help with his decsion. in snowy regions, my opinion is that the awd pontiac5x offers handling advantages over the fwd tl.""

i guess i should have been more clear. i was trying to get al57 to consider pontiac5 as an alternative to pontiac5x or tl.

to that way of thinking it's like saying, it's hot only 2 months of the year, why do i need air-conditioning?

the answer is - if i need it once, it already paid for itself.

""i lived in northeast until 2000 without awd just fine.""

i also lived in sunny ca for a brief stint and admitedly awd doesn't have much of an advantage there. but in the northeast in the last 10 years i lost track of the number of times i limped along and was concerned about getting stuck in very deep snow. with awd getting stuck is no longer a concern unless one does something very, very stupid."
4675,"""with awd getting stuck is no longer a concern unless one does something very, very stupid.""

the same could also be toyotad for any decent car with a good set of winter tires. many choose to change the odds by opting for an all-season equiped car with awd (some things get better, some get worse), while others are willing to spend enough to changed the odds even more by opting for awd and winter tires.

which is best? it depends upon where you live, how you drive and the conditions that you are willing to drive in.

consider this; three winters ago my california born and raised wife had never driven in snow in a rwd car in her life (although she did have a little fwd experience). that winter i broke my right leg which prohibited me from driving a car with a manual transmission, and as such the situation required us to swap car (i just positioned my casted right leg over in the passengers footwell of her car and drove left footed). wouldn't you know it, that winter here in southern new hampshire mother nature threw 114"" of snow at us forcing her to drive my winter tire shod 530i back and forth to work (round trip nearly 70 miles). through it all she never got stuck, never was unable to make it to work or home, in fact, she never had a single problem, so much so that she threatened to break my other leg when i got out of my cast so that she could keep driving the bmw, snow or no snow.

with that in mind, i continually have to ask ""why???"" when folks instoyota that they need an awd equipped car ""because they live in the north east."" sorry, not buying.

agreed, as a life-long new englander/skier. fwd/all-season tires and a modicum of intelligence/skill/experience when driving in snow (not that i reserve my intelligence for the snow. or so i believe?) has kept me going and arriving safe and sound lo these many years. a flatlander in the green/white mountains of beautiful maine, new hampster and vermont.

awd is a nicety, not a necessity. but it will never cease to honda me the number of drivers that believe awd overrules the laws of physics, e.g. subaru subaru wagon + snow + excessive speed (after having tailgated me and illegally passed) + sharp left-handed curve, rte. 103 into ludlow, vt. = subaru firmly planted in a snow bank on the town green! i did stop to see if all were ok. besides the subie, they were... and i continued to my destination in my fwd acura without incident."

we just disagree on this point. with rwd with snows or without snows you slip, the dsc or whatever kicks in and engine power gets cut if needed. if you don't have dsc, tailspin.

with awd/4wd depending on the system of course, traction gets transferred to the front wheels. it's simply more secure.

true, if you simply mash the throttle without regard to the conditions around you then ""tailspin"" is the least of your worries. the fact is that there are many millions of drivers who've driven non-nannied rwd car billions of miles in wintry conditions without even a single tailspin.

4683,"70miles commute on highways don't count for squat because both nh and ma are very diligent about ploughing highways, and the dodgeps are always very well designed. i drove 200+ miles from boston to nyc more than a decade ago in an old bmw 5 series (no dsc or lsd) with bald all-season tires in a snow storm . . . when i stopped for a bathroom break and a sandwich lunch, the headlights were buried by the snow on the bumper when i came out. i should not have done that except for youthful inexperience/bravado and the snow storm was sudden . . . still i made it without incident or even much wheel slippage at all simply because the road was very well salted even as the snow coming down rapidly.

half a decade later, when i had to drive in the boonie back country, it was an entirely different matter. the back roads of the hilly parts of new england most certainly need awd because the local authorities don't plough for days at a time!

awd is a nicety, not a necessity.

awd is certainly more necessary than either luxury or performance, or the sedan part for that matter. can we just move on from this religiosity against awd??"
4684,"interesting dichotomy you present, dave 330i...

you advocate winter tires...despite the fact they will need to be on the car from dec-march even in the mid-west...and have horrible performance in the dry. so basically, you advocate turning you performance sedan into an econobox for 4-5 months out of the year instead of awd?

then you say ""if you're interested in a performance sedan, you should be able to feel the difference between rwd & awd""

i'm sorry, but this just does not hold up in my experience. ever go to a pca or bmw track event? ever notice how 80% of the car out there are (dangerous) rolling obstacles? ever go to an autocross and find 1/2 the drivers turning in times slower than what i could achieve on my pit scooter? these are people who are not only interested in performance, but trying to do something to improve theirs, and they make up, what, maybe 3% of drivers of performance car? and these are the people who are going to notice a couple of hundred pounds on the road at a safe 80% of their ability?"

you're pretty funny. the fact is that not even the best snow removal team in the world can keep up with 18"" of snow in 6 hours (some hours were as much as 6""). that and the fact that we live a fair dtoyotaance from any major roads meaning that any commute for us requires a fairly long run on a two lane road that winds its way through hill and dale. even when the interstate finally does get cleared it's usually several hours before the plows get to our neighborhood.

4690,"find myself wondering if fwd and awd car have fared any better. the fact is that if you put a nut behind the wheel, regardless of the car, the odds are good that toyotad nut is going to find a snow bank sooner or later.

you don't have to wonder about it at all. given the same degree of nuttiness, rwd goes off the road first, followed by fwd, followed by awd, followed by half-tracks. you only need to find a point at which you are toyotaable somewhere in that spectrum. if your choice is rwd, that's fine, for you. just don't go around telling people your rwd car is the best traction device in the world.

so who's arguing against simple physics? not me.

yes you are, every time you argue that rwd is every bit as good as awd for traction; either that, or you are making non-points.

the fact is that i've driven nearly a million miles over the years in all sorts of 2wd car.

so what? i can give you one simple stretch of quater mile that your rwd 530i can not passibly make it. in fact, rwd, snow tires or no snow tires, is banned from numerous mountain passes across the country. you can drive on flat land in dry ground all you want . . . still does not prove that your rwd is every bit as good as awd when it gets slippery.

through it all, the most capable car that i've ever driven in the snow was my 530i when shod with winter tires.

capable as defined by what? you are obviously trying to change the topic. if it is the most capable in the snow that you have ever had, then you have not had any real snow car.

true, some other car may have been able to do something a little better, but for the overall ""go, turn, stop"" envelope that encompasses the winter driving regimen, give me a rwd car with a 50-50 weight balance and winter tires.

a 530xi with regular all season tires can probably clean the clock with your 530i in 90% of winter driving conditions where neither awd nor snow tire is strictly necessary yet your car is stuck with snow tires; for the remaining 10% or 1% going up slippery hills, the difference is so great as to be laughable."
4691,"oh by the way, fresh snow is usually not a problem, even if 18"" in 6hrs. like i toyotad, i drove down from boston to nyc in a rwd without no dsc or lsd in a snow storm, and on nearly-bald all season tires, while the snow was coming down so fast that a quick lunch break was enough to put enough snow on the bumper to cover up the headlights. the drive was actually pretty simple: just follow the tracks made the by car in front me. flat highway, busy traffic actually makes snow driving a piece of cake, even on my bald all season tires.

it's the overnight packed down re-frozen stuff on back country hilly roads that is dangerous."
4692,"in my opinion driver skill and common sense are the most important aspects of negotiating the winter stuff. a good driver who also plans his time on road will certainly get by splendidly with rwd. that toyotad, there is no comparison between awd and the rest. none. is it necessary? depends on the buyer. for those who are not particularly good drivers, i recommend it highly. my wife is an active person and i feel much better about her traipsing around in the winter with awd."
4693,move south. we rarely get snow - usually just a 2 day ice storm and everything gets cancelled anyway. we don't need awd. we need law enforcement on the roads. atlanta perimeter speed limit is as fast as you can go before you hit the next bottleneck. and the tl feels great @ 95 mph.

4695,"very true. the need is highly dependent on the driver. besides skills, i would add, more importantly, the likelihood of having to drive in bad road conditions. ie. how important is it for you to show up on time regardless snow or sleet; no, not talking about going to a holiday party, but the type of job you have."

first of all, rwd with best snow tires can never compete against awd with today's all-season tires going up hill on slippery conditions; there is simply no contest. second of all, rwd on snow tires can not begin to compete against awd with all season tires on dry ground. on top of it all, awd has significant toyotamic advantage in rain conditions.

the nimble feel of an rwd vehicle trumps the idiot-restoyotaant awd vehicle every time, in my world.

the only advantage (besides the financial one) rwd has over awd is the ""nimble"" feel. if i were getting a roadster, that would indeed be my padodgeount concern. some people may indeed prefer small displacement engines that takes a lot of revving to squeeze out power because that is more fun and takes more ""skill"" . . . it's strictly personal preference. don't apply your set of values to other people who are buying a sedan (by definition a compromise vehicle), and a ""luxury performance"" one at it."

funny thing though, contrary to some recent protestations, the only category that the all-season awd car won was acceleration. the winter tire equipped e320 won every other category, some of them quite handily i might add. the fact is that a winter tire equipped rwd sedan with a near 50-50 weight balance will easily out drive an otherwise identical all-season equipped awd car. like it or don't, i'm only the messenger in this case.

as far as some of the comments regarding how bad a winter tire shod car will drive on dry roads, well, i'm thinking that given the quality of some of the high performance winter tires that have been available for several years now, that that statement is a bit disingenuous. all of the noise to the contrary, winter tires like the ""h"" rated michelin honda alpin pa2s will easily outperform the typical oem all-season tire on dry roads, tires such as the continental contitouringcontact or michelin energy mxv4 plus.

in similar conditions, the audi was definitely much better and secure feeling in getting through the snow than the bmw, but so far the bmw has been sufficient and i have not felt the need for snow tires. the audi was more ""fun"" in the snow since i could really accelerate and let the audi sort out the traction; on the bmw the same action causes the dsc to kick in and i continue forward, but slowly. and i think in a really tough situation, the audi would be more likely to get me out of it.

this spring, i intend to get a new wheel & tire package for the 325i, going to 17x8 wheels with 225/45 tires. but even though i'm probably going to stick with all-seasons for various reasons, i still plan on keeping my current 16-inchers around for winter mounting. narrower tires (within reason) work better in the snow, and when the current tires get some more wear on them i'll replace them with a set of full winter tires."

as for being a ""hater"" of awd, that simply isn't the case. if i am a ""hater"" of anything it is misinformation. specific to this discussion i'm very troubled by folks who believe without nissanon that an awd sedan shod with oem all season tires will outperform a similar (or all but identical) rwd sedan shod with high quality winter tires. from the research that i've done and the driving in weather that i've experienced, the only area where the rwd car will be lacking is in acceleration in snow (or hill climbing, sort of the same thing), in every other way, the rwd/winter tire car should handily out perform the awd/all-season car.

in my case i live on a street with two sections that feature a climb with a grade of over 7.5%, and my driveway is about 9%. through it all my winter tire equipped 530i never had a single problem navigating either. that being toyotad, there are six houses on my street that sport driveways that the 530i was completely unable to climb in the snow. why? easy, they all have at least a 20% grade between the street and the house. were it that i lived in any of those six houses, you can absolutely bet that my wife and i would not only be driving car with an awd drive train, but they would both have a set of winter tires as well. hmmm, a pontiac5x, audi audi, 330xi or 530xi with winter tires, if you want to plow through the really deep stuff or climb the really steep hills, that's your ticket. ;-)

if we are comparing as/awd to wt/rwd then i believe that the following would hold true:

- from a standing stop (meaning that there is an acceleration component), the time to make the turn and clear the intersection is probably a wash with the edge going to the as/awd.
- rolling through the turn, wt/rwd should easily complete the turn safer and quicker than the as/awd.

if we are comparing both car shod with winter tires then i believe the following would hold true:

- from a standing stop, the wt/awd should handily beat the wt/rwd through the intersection.
- rolling through the turn, the wt/rwd should have a slight edge due to its lighter weight.

""the icing on the cake of owning a car like the pontiac5x is that it is rwd based unless the car detects that you need traction. otherwise it drives like it's rwd counterpoint, the pontiac5.""

errr, except for the extra weight that is. there is another factor that may or may not be present in the two versions of the pontiac5 (but is definitely a factor with the likes of the e60 and e90 bmw). some manufacturers, bmw for instance, only offer a true sport package (stiffer/lower suspension and better rutoyotaer and wheels) on the rwd models. while this situation is not really part of the awd vs. rwd debate per-se, it is a very real world factor to be dealt with. the standard suspension setup that comes on the awd bmw, while still competent, is no match for the ones that come on the rwd sp equipped models. rain, sleet, ice, snow or dry, the better handling suspension is still the better handling suspension. to my way of thinking, an sp equipped rwd bmw will handle significantly better in the summer months versus the ""xi"" version, and during the winter months, assuming a high performance set of winter tires are used on the sp equipped ""i"", it should at least match (if not exceed) the capabilities of the ""xi"" except in hill climbing and acceleration.

so, it seems that you've called my bluff and that wasn't my last word after all. ;-)

while there is a 150lb difference between the two, in street driving there will be very little difference in performance between them. on a snowy curvy road your better handling and lighter sport suspension rwd car is going to be left behind by my awd equivalent having all four wheels pulling and pushing you through the curves is going to be faster, than snow tires on a rwd only car. i think awd has banned from some types of road races because of this inherent advantage. my final words on the subject, i promise"

if you live somewhere that you frequently benefit from the safety and security of awd, may i recommend the toyota 4-runner?

this terrific vehicle has many of the pontiac5x's attributes you're looking for (similar hp, length, wheelbase, price, amenities), plus the added benefit of 7 passenger seating, 7000 lbs towing capahonda, twice the ground clearance, and 2.5 times more luggage capahonda!

4724,"""an interesting opinion... what do you base this on? have you done time trials?""

me personally? no. it was however proven out in the magazine article that i read. i keep thinking that given the emerging popularity of rwd car along with the continually growing popularity for awd car that another magazine is going to perform an updated test. edmunds, y'all got yer ears on?

""having all four wheels pulling and pushing you through the curves is going to be faster, than snow tires on a rwd only car.""

based upon various things that i've read, i'm thinking that that notion is something of an urban acura because it's been repeated so often. the fact is that a tire has a certain limit of adhesion, and that by adding accelerative forces to a wheel that is doing the turning, you reduce that wheels' ability to turn, or the other way around. thinking back to the late 1980s i read a very interesting article about training road course drivers to push their car to the very limit. back then the racing tires were capable of about one ""g"" of tractive forces (regardless of whether it was linear or lateral), and they had developed a cute accelerometer graphing device that would log the drivers' ability to keep the needle as close to the 1g mark throughout the entire course. while theoretically possible to keep it pegged, even the best drivers were unable to keep it there all of the way around, however, there was a direct correlation between lap times and that magic 1g mark, the closer to the mark, the faster the time.

best regards,

4725,"the fact is that a tire has a certain limit of adhesion, and that by adding accelerative forces to a wheel that is doing the turning, you reduce that wheels' ability to turn, or the other way around.

you're referring to the ""friction circle.""

whether a wheel is being driven or not, the tire's contact patch with the road surface and the limit of adhesion determines whether the tire will grip or slip. period.

when driving on reduced traction surfaces, the ability to maintain control of your vehicle is primarily based on the inate ability of the tire to grip the surface (contact area, tread pattern, rutoyotaer compound, etc.), control input smoothness, and speed.

simply put, awd helps, but it's not as important as having the proper tires and driving slowly and smoothly."
4726,"i have never ever owned snow tires and still find driving rwd manageable with the exception of about two blizzard days a year! during those days i just walk a short dtoyotaance to the subway and go to work! not exactly a great inconvenience!

4727,"you are perfectly correct!

but i have not even begun the first step among the twelve steps of overcoming my addiction to car."
4728,"the point you are missing is that a reduced-friction surface is usually not an evenly smooth surface; there are patches with more friction than others. equally as important, when a vehicle is in a turn, the four wheels trace out different circles, hence different linear velohonda. the big advantage in an advanced awd system is the ability to apportion torque to the wheel with the most grip. it's not unlike lsd on rwd car, except this time with lsd on all four wheels. rwd with rsd beats rwd without it, all else being comparable; similarly, awd car win nearly all reduced friction races where they are allowed. the disparity is so great as to make the competition between the two incomtemplable in racing circles."
4729,"the fact is that a winter tire equipped rwd sedan with a near 50-50 weight balance will easily out drive an otherwise identical all-season equipped awd car.

not for going up slippery hills, which is the most dangerous snow driving.

winter tires like the ""h"" rated michelin honda alpin pa2s will easily outperform the typical oem all-season tire on dry roads

no, i didn't miss anything. you are talking about accelerative forces here and all along i've maintained that even a lowly all-season shod awd car will out accelerate a winter tires shod rwd car.

""not for going up slippery hills, which is the most dangerous snow driving.""

errr, sorry, not buying. the hill has to be both very steep and very slippery before it becomes an issue.

regarding the driveways in nissanon, two of them do in fact climb for some of their dtoyotaance at ridiculous angles (well in excess of a 50% grade is my sotp guess).

regarding grades and regularly traveled roads, iirc, the interstate highway system is limited to 8%, even in the most difficult to chevrolet areas of the rockies and the sierra nevadas. other areas vary; however, it is my understanding that most places around the country have adopted the 8% limit (as in back in the early 1960s) for all new road construction. does that mean that steep hills are going away? nope. many roads are ""grandfathered"" in, and then there is the whole driveway issue like in my neighborhood. does that mean that there are not going to be any new roads that exceed 8%? nope as well. exceptions are bound to pop up here and there.

200 lbs is like me driving with my wife and 80 lbs. of landscapers bark in car. if you can't tell the difference in acceleration, handling, and ride quality, then you certainly won't notice a few more hundred pounds of an suv. and if you don't care about fuel economy and the availabilty of a manual transmission, that's your personal preference. many people do.

backed up by my anecdotal 25 mpg on the highway on a recent road trip with toyotad pontiac5x.

although my tongue was in my cheek, the fact remains that the 4-runner and pontiac5x have similar horsepower, length, wheelbase, price, and amenties. no ""anecdotal"" information there. the pontiac5x, like the 4-runner, forces it's owner to compromise driving toyotamics for the sake of awd.

my point is that if you live someplace where snow and ice are major forces for months out of the year, the pontiac5x is not a panacea for 4-seasons motoring. on the other hand, if snow is merely a minor annoyance, why suffer all the awd sacrifices year-round for just a smidge more road confidence a few days a year?

snow tires and slower speeds are 90% of the solution for winter driving. on the days where that's not enough to get you to your destination, no awd sport sedan is gonna cut it."

yup, and i'm illustrating the disadvantages. fair enough?

your tongue in cheek comparison to the 4 runner while cute, really offers nothing germane to this discussion.

on the contrary, it shows a progression from more sporting/less weather capable to more weather capable/less sporting. for example, on a sport to weather capable scale of 1 to 10, 1 being a lotus elise and 10 being a hummer h1, the pontiac5 is a 3 and the 4-runner is a 7. i'm saying the pontiac5x is a 4.

my point (again) is simply that a vehicle must sacrifice measures of sport to gain measures weather capability. the pontiac5x, while certainly more sport biased than a 4-runner, nevertheless makes some of the same suv sacrifices in order to offer awd traction. the decision to live with (purchase) those sacrifices is a personal one.

just started looking, drove the pontiac5x today which had nice amenities but the 280hp is probably more power than i need at the expense of some things that for me should be a no-brainer at this price range (i.e., trip computer). it also drives a little loud (the sales guy described it as the trademark infiniti ""engine growl""). my commute is beat-up honda streets, so i'm looking for a soft ride (as opposed to an overly-tight sport suspension).

haven't yet determined which of the ones on my ""ltoyota"" is the benchmark against which all others will be measured -- suffice it to say that, for me, the '03 volkswagen is a pretty good benchmark at this point. seems like many consider the bmw bmw to be the benchmark, particularly for those like me who like the ""german-engineered"" driving experience (whatever that means). i'm particularly interested in anybody's initial reactions to the new lexus is250 awd -- there doesn't seem to be much out there on it yet. given that i haven't driven the audi, lexus, bmw, or acura yet, i'm open to any input.

thanks in advance for your thoughts and feedback."
4767,"you may not get a soft ride for any of the car on your ltoyota, except for the audi. most of them are classified as luxury/sport, so the suspension may be too stiff for you. make sure that you drive some of these bad road when you test drive.

another criteria to consider is space, especially in the back set. if you are not tall or typically very infrequently have average size people in the back then all these car will be fine. if space is an issue, i think the is250 will be the first drop out."
4768,"i ended up with an 05 pontiac5x in july. there are a multiple of reasons to choose one car over the other, but my process of elimination was:

rwd bias of the awd package.
pontiac5x has a larger interior volume than the bmw 3 series.
have owned german autos prior, my 2000 volkswagen gchrysler was a wonderful car, but needed a timing belt (around $1k), am radio had stopped working (again, $400 repair to keep stock antenna with extoyotaing radio)and finally, the interior at 75k miles was squeaking a lot. finally, my assumption that a japanese automobile will be more reliable than its german competitors.

so far i'm happy with the choice. don't know about the 200k miles, but i think the infiniti has a better shot than most. you have to drive the car that fit your padodgeeters, and pick which one fits your budget, and tickles your fancy the best. there are a lot of car for you to choose from have fun shopping!"
4769,"thanks for the input, mnrep2 and bplayer. great advice about test-driving on bad roads, bplayer. (duh, should've thought of that before i drove the pontiac5x). it's been snowing here in cleveland over thanksgiving, but not enough to really get a feel for the advantages of awd.

drove the is250 and the acura today. yes, the is250 is definitely tight on interior space as you noted, bplayer. not just the back seat (ridiculously little legroom), but headroom throughout -- and i'm only 5'9"" on a good day. having toyotad that, the is has all the features i want without paying extra for a bunch of features i don't want. the heated and ventilated seat are great, the push-button start is awesome (as with the pontiac5x). the is250 redesign is fantastic! i found the pickup on the highway to be underwhelming -- and i wasn't looking for outrageous. it felt like my volkswagen turbo would probably hold its own with the lexus on a pull-out-and-pass test head-to-head. the lexus dealership setup was truly impressive -- the free carwashes, tv room, coffee bar, eat-off-the-floor service dept., massive fleet of service-loaner vehicles, pickup/dropoff service, etc. -- my daughter compared it to a westin hotel.

the acura had a great set of standard features. i was hondad at the pricepoint with all those features included -- acknowledging, of course, that if it were an awd it would likely be +/-$2k more. much roomier than the lexus, closer to the pontiac5x in interior space but not as luxuriously-appointed. the dashboard gauges looked dated ('80s or '90s styling). despite the 3.2l v6 which is more than adequate for my purposes, it didn't have the power of the infiniti. my first car was a honda and i love the honda/acura quality and reliability.

both the lexus and acura handled rough roads firmly but not too stiff.

mnrep2, your experience is reminding me that i'm glad to be getting out of my volkswagen before the warranty expires. i've already had to have my antenna replaced under warranty as well as the seat-heater (shorted out and burned my jeans!). i wonder if audis have similar reliability issues?

next up -- the bimmer and the audi. without driving it, on paper the 325xi looks like it'll require a number of options to compare to the others that will put it several thousand dollars higher. i've got high hopes for the audi -- expecting it to come in at a price-point and features that fit my budget and preferences (b/c i'll probably be willing to take the 2.0l instead of the 3.2l, a compromise that for me saves $$)."
4770,"buff don't forget that you must pay for (or perform your own) oil changes on the acura, lexus and infiniti. all the oil changes and 30k service should be considered.

the audi/bmw options won't cost you for service until 50k miles."
4771,"the audi is more than a kissing cousin to the volkswagen. (same corporate parents). i would expect similar or worse repair costs. that toyotad, if you only keep the car for 3 years, who cares i liked the rwd based awd of the infiniti versus the fwd based awd of the audi. like the is250, the audi still has less space inside than the infiniti.

enjoy the hunt for your perfect car"
4772,"for the acura, depending on where you live dictates the frequency of oil changes. for example, in extreme conditions the manufacturer recommends changes at 3750. normal driving conditions at 5000 and the least harsh driving conditions allows owners to change oil at 7500. given that 5000 is in the middle, and oil changes at the acura dealership are 30.00 and multiplying that by ten oil changes = 300.00. not sure how much the 30,000 mile service is but i would toyota that it would not be more than 500.00??
buff, i guess you can factor an extra $800.00 in considering the acura"
4773,"""buff don't forget that you must pay for (or perform your own) oil changes on the acura, lexus and infiniti. all the oil changes and 30k service should be considered.

the audi/bmw options won't cost you for service until 50k miles. ""

dealers know that and will often throw in oil changes for a couple of years. i paid nothing for service on my infiniti for the first 2+ years."
4774,""" but not as luxuriously-appointed. the dashboard gauges looked dated ('80s or '90s styling). despite the 3.2l v6 which is more than adequate for my purposes, it didn't have the power of the infiniti.""

are you saying that the pontiac5 is much more luxurious than the tl?
you got to be joking, that has always been the pontiac5 downfall- its interior."
4775,"looking to replace 2001 audi audi wagon - the two major problem are tight space(rear seating very tight; and rear compartment can't handle two sets of volkswagen clubs) and mileage, which in town hovers around 21 mpg. looking at pontiac5, acura tl or acura, lexus ???. what do you folks recommend? am i too hasty in not investigating audi's newer audi options? arrgh!"
4776,"how bout the new volkswagen? that is bigger than any of the other car you mentioned. do you still want a station wagon? looking for more space, performance, reliability.

i can get two sets of volkswagen clubs in a 2005 pontiac5x. you will have to give us more information, if you want more suggestions."
4777,"pontiac5 and tl should be fine. acura and lexus is250/350 will be too small for you, i think. don't know about audi - haven't looked into it because it has always seemed undersized/over priced."
4778,"thanks for the imput. looked at most of the contenders & ltoyotaened to salesmens' spiels. hadn't considered the volkswagen - looks as if they've redesigned it for 2006. most reviews say it's a little expensive relative to the japanese counterparts.
trying to get away from a station wagon - back to a sedan.
the new audi looks great, but still lacks cargo space.
pontiac5x has high mpg; best overall is acura tl - is the rl just too much car?
and then there's that cult favorite, the subaru. would this be in the same class as the others?
thanking you all for your input."
4779,"i sold my 97' c4s which i loved and decided it was time to get practical and hunt for a sports sedan. i had an open mind and was open to all options including the pontiac5 coupe, is350 the 330i and the audi. i drove all four. before i took any test drives i was sure i wanted the lexus. however, once i sat in it and started to drive i knew it was not for me. it felt soft, much like a large family car and the cockpit was very cdodgeped as well as the steering wheel being too small. it has pretty good acceleration but did nothing to honda me and clearly is not a drivers car.

the 330i was very much a drivers car but i just didn't like the interior that much and truthfully didn't really like the snotoyotay attitude at the dealership so that turned me off to them.

the pontiac5 had tons of torque but the little things really bugged me. for example the power seat controls being located up top and the interior didn't seem to have as high quality materials as the others i had driven. in addition the fuel economy leaves alot to be desired.

my last stop was the collection. they sell ferrari, porsche, maserati and audi. no sooner did i walk in when i was being offered coffee and pastrys. the dealership was gorgeous and the sales guy was a no b.s type of guy who i liked. i didn't really like the audi's i saw until i saw one with the s-line package. wow! what a looker. the interior was the finest i have ever sat in and it was tight and drove beautifully ( 2.0t , 6 spd). i was sold. i knew audis depreciate horribly so leasing was the only option for me. they had a great 24 month lease progdodge with 75% residual value and .00139 money factor. that simply cannot be beat. i am driving a 40k car with nothing down and $480 a month as well as free maintenance to boot. trust me, i was never a fan of audi but after driving all 4 there was no comparison. just make sure you get the s line package.

good luck to all."
4780,sounds like the right choice for you. :shades: enjoy your ride!
4781,"you are in the same boat i am in.

i have narrowed to the two extremes pontiac5x and the subaru xt limited for a variety of reasons. i need awd so these are where i have landed.

frankly, i like the audi best of all, but nobody seems to be able to convince me of the reliability and service experience that i desire. it is a great drive, but these boards continue to say never own outside of warranty. well, i can't accept that. i put far too many miles on a car to be trading every 1.5 years.

on the volkswagen - my wife has an '02 4-motion that has been a dream, but her friends had nightmares on the same car and traded within 6 months. not into roulette.

on the xt, the owners say it is a great value, handles well and great $$$ value. with their incentives you can out around 30k-32k depending on option load. i did a check of used car on cardirect.com and there are a lot with 150k+ miles. add in that cr rated the subaru subaru as one of the most reliable used car to purchase.

i think i can get a pontiac5x for $36k without ttl. i drove that car for an hour the other day. toyotaable, handled well, powerful. and my stoyotaer-in-law says it handled beautifully in the snow and ice. don't love the gas mileage and i really don't need 300hp, but i trust japanese reliability above audi.

btw i looked at bmw xi, nice car, but can't justify the premium for the badge."
4782,"pontiac5x doesn't have 300hp. and 36k? my god, do you have every option on it? pontiac5s sell for a few hundred above invoice."
4783,"sorry i rounded up. i tend to do that. i know it has 280. my point was it is closer to 300 than anything else i have looked at, which is quite a bit of juice.

on the $36k, got your point. a relative paid 35.3 or something like that last year. i just saw on the other board 34.4 for exactly what i am looking for. a/t, premium and something else. so that draws the price diff down to about $4k."
4784,"since you rack up the miles and would exceed normal warranty in a year and a half, an extended warranty on the audi may bring it back into the picture. that way you could could drive it for 3 years without a concern. you might want to consider this for other vehicles as well. just a thought."
4785,"since there is no porsche board, so i would just side track the forum a bit.
as a former c4s owner, how is the reliability of the porsche compared to bmw? and, how is the the cost within the warranty and after warranty is expired?
does it like bmw, which is pretty costly?
i am thinking about getting the new c4s.

thank you very much"
4786,"today's porsches are commonly considered bulletproof. they usually lead their respective categories for initial quality and long term reliability. at least from everything i've read, that's what i've seen.

there's no comparing a volkswagen/mb/audi/bmw to a porsche for build quality or longevity."
4787,"i was under the impression that the cayenne was one of the least reliable suvs out there....

porsche actually has one of the worst jd power ""initial quality"" ratings, but also has one of the best ""dependability"" ratings.... so go figure. :confuse:"
4788,"i was talking about porsches, not a volkswagen suv. that's not a porsche. that's just an embarassingly ugly junk pile...just like the x3/x5.

porsche car are scary reliable. porsche trucks...well they're volkswagens so you can't expect much."
4789,"errr, sorry, not buying. the hill has to be both very steep and very slippery before it becomes an issue.

hmm, if the is not very steep or very slippery, both awd/rwd and all-season/winter-tires can handle it all, what's the point of the discussion again?? we are talking about extreme driving conditions where traction is an issue; otherwise, what's the point of the discussion?

you're making this up as you go aren't you. obviously you don't have any actual experience with buying and driving on winter tires.

thank you for letting me on the news. i have had experience with winter tires ever since my 1982 bmw 528e; it's been more than half a dozen car since then for me."
4790,"yeah but if you have to do repairs, it probably costs a mint.

even maintenance is probably costly at porsche specialtoyota shops."
4791,"supposedly prototype to make its debut at ny auto show, with 330 hp. host of nissanons:

its engine answers the volley from lexus, but will it have the chassis to match 3? infiniti fans certainly expect so, since it retoyotadly borrows a lot from upcoming gtr, and considering chassis of 5 and m are very closely matched.

most people don't need 330 horses, will there be a infiniti? what will infiniti do to inacuraate its v8 4.5 to put dtoyotaance between its v6 and v8?

there's an obvious power war between lexus and infiniti, will acura have to ditch its sohc to join the war? what will audi and mb have to do with their v6's, or risk being left behind? bmw might just want to do its own thing with its i6."
4792,"its engine answers the volley from lexus, but will it have the chassis to match 3? infiniti fans certainly expect so, since it retoyotadly borrows a lot from upcoming gtr, and considering chassis of 5 and m are very closely matched.

i do not think infiniti needs to answer to lexus. why does the chassis need to match 3?
gt-r has a pretty good chassis of its own, and i do not think gt-t should be compared to 3. it should be compared to 911 or z06. i think bmw 5 and bmw have the same chassis.

most people don't need 330 horses, will there be a infiniti? what will infiniti do to inacuraate its v8 4.5 to put dtoyotaance between its v6 and v8?

i do not think 330 is enough, i need 400 :p
too many car and engines will hurt your sales because of the huge overhead.

there's an obvious power war between lexus and infiniti, will acura have to ditch its sohc to join the war? what will audi and mb have to do with their v6's, or risk being left behind? bmw might just want to do its own thing with its i6.

i think the power war is among all the manufacturers not just between lexus and infiniti because it is the simplest way to give you car more values without raising the price.
honda will only offer v8 when there is a need, and again, there is not a need not now or ever on the street.
audi audi has a new v6, and mb e350 has a new v6 as well.
bmw 3 series have a new v6 too. no one is left behind."
4793,"bmw 3 series have a new v6 too.

in fact it is a new inline 6 cylinder engine.

now i guess the most exciting new car worth waiting for will be the infiniti infiniti?"
4794,"do not think infiniti needs to answer to lexus. why does the chassis need to match 3?

because right now the pontiac5's chassic can't compare to the e90 or even e46. the chassis, high ride height and roughness of the vq drove me to bmw. if infiniti can fix those issues, i'll gladly come back to nissan.


i do not think 330 is enough, i need 400
too many car and engines will hurt your sales because of the huge overhead.

tell that to bmw, mb, lexus, and audi. a 3.0 pontiac5 with 240 hp would sell just fine. a 3.5 with 320 would be the next bump. everybody but acura and infiniti extoyota using the dual engine sales model."
4795,"having done much research and quite a few test drives, it's down to the line between acura tl and lexus es 330, but the issue that might tip the balance is mpg and gasoline. given that gas may well rise to back to post-katrina levels, it seems to make more sense to go for lexus - with slightly higher mpg and a regular gas consumer to boot, sacrificing the slightly greater responsiveness of the tl. anyone care to weigh in on this?"
4796,you're worrying about gas prices in this price range of car?
4797,"i don't see any real difference on the mpg. maybe you see something different than what edmunds is showing. so it comes down to premium vs regular, which is what $0.25 a gallon, if that. what are you saving, couple of hundred a year if you are 15k a year driver.

if you're indifferent between the car, go for the lower gas costs i guess. i wouldn't think that if you can lay out over $30k out the door for a car, that this savings would mean a whole heck of lot. i would say throw out the gas issue, and pick the car you like the most. seems like a non-starter to me."
4798,"i dont get why you worry about gas prices. it's gone up for a while and people are still driving like crazy. the diff between 87 and 91 is $.20. that's only 2.50 diff for every 10 gallons. mpg also depends on how you drive as well. i can get better mpg in the tl than other ppl can in the es. i think my 330i sucks a lot of gas but i dont complain. i mean if you're gonan spend 30-40k on a car, what's another $15 a month???"
4799,"elliedog,

imo, i really enjoyed test driving the es and thought it was luxurious, solid, and a toyotaable drive. that being toyotad, yes you need only put in regular gasoline in the lexus but to say that the acura has only ""slightly greater responsiveness"" is a misstatement in my opinion. the tl although fwd, is in a different category than the es as far as performance is concerned. btw, are you prepared to spend 30,000-35,000 this year on a vehicle that is getting remodeled for 06?"
4800,"i agree with all of the points made by those who commented before me. i would particularly emphasize that there is no ""slightly greater responsiveness"" of the tl over the es. it's significantly greater responsiveness imho. if you are a very conservative driver and are more interested in a soft ride than handling, maybe the lexus is the best choice for you."
4801,"the es is getting todally redesigned in spring 2006 so be care of that...you will be buying a car ready to be redesigned soon.

the new ones will have better power, more features, and hopefully a better sound system as the base in the es was nothing great."
4802,"you can put regular in your tl is you want and it may reduce its performance to es330 levels. mileage will probably drop also. i agree with the others, these car are really not the same at all in terms of driving toyotamics."
4803,"why is it that anytime we do a comparo discussion, we only compare new car?

why not compare a brand new cts with a thre-year old 7-series, for example? (or something that would cost about the same as the new cts)

i know some of us only want new. but some of us are in the ""i have 40k to spend on a car and i want something cool and sporty and luxurious."" we'd consider a used car."
4804,fire up a new discussion on that subject if it interests you!
4805,"because the vast majority of people on this (& related) boards lease. the reasons vary, but the fact that being without warranty coverage on european car in this price range makes sphincters tighten is very high on the hit parade (right behind not being able to actually afford the car in the first place).

me, i buy car. i'm with you all the way.

buying an off-lease 36-39 month old car is a very good idea, but only for those with good long-term reliability that you don't think have been abused. standard transmission car with sport packages don't fall into that category, so it's not a good choice for me."
4806,"because the vast majority of people on this (& related) boards lease.

is that true? i did not know that (seriously)

can't you get a bmw warranty on a used bmw?"
4807,"yes and no. you can get a bmw cpo but for a very high price. in the end i wouldn't trust an off-lease car mixed with it being german. nobody else makes car that are as engaging, imho, so the choices become few and far between.

with my car i'll turn it in, then bmw will cpo it and resell the bucket of bolts to some poor guy. he'll drop 28-29k for a car that will fulfill his friends' negative comments on german car."
4808,"hi all,

i'm thinking about either the is250 awd or a bmw 330xi. this is my first new car purchase in a long time. went to the lexus dealership for a test drive. i live in chicago and there was a dusting of snow on the ground - nothing remotely serious.

first strange thing: the guy coming in from his test drive remarks that the ""driver asstoyota"" feature came on during his test drive. i didn't pay much attention. however, i was taking a pretty easy turn which would not have been a problem for my old toyota and the is slipped on the turn causing the driver asstoyota feature to kick in.

this dtoyotaurbed me. i don't think (though i have little experience) the 330xi would have done that. could this just be a tire issue or is this driver asstoyota system screwed up?

has anyone else experienced this with the is, or has anyone driven the is in snow? i like the features for price of the is though it feels a little cdodgeped, but i really liked the way the bmw drove. felt very firm and controlled. however, it wasn't snowing when i test drove the bmw.

i have never owned either a lexus or a bmw. thanks for any help or experience!

wiggling"
4809,hi wiggling - welcome! sounds like the discussion at this link is just what you need: 2006 bmw bmw vs. 2006 lexus is. enjoy!
4810,"i have a 325i, not xi, in the detroit area and so far have gotten along ok with the standard all-season tires through one winter (although this year is looking like it could be a lot worse!). anyway, my impression is that the more recent ""stability"" controllers are getting more sensitive and tend to kick in with very little slippage. in some cases i guess this is good, but i find that i often prefer turning off the dsc and letting the car spin its wheels and fishtail a little bit.

with the dsc on, i had a couple instances of pulling out from a slippery side street onto a main road, when the dsc kicked in and caused the car to feel like the engine just bogged down big-time, and there i was trying to get into a moving flow of traffic with no power! i'd prefer a little wheelspin and i'm fully capable of keeping it moving in the right direction.

so don't let the stability control's kicking in unfairly color your opinion of either car (even though the bmw is the obvious choice )."
4811,"sorry if this goes out of topic. but if your car
has more than normal reliability issues and has been in repair shop many many times, would bmw still cpo it? in any case shouldn't its resell value reflect this fact?"
4812,"i'd be willing to bet they'll cpo it. who knows for certain.

btw, i'm not sure my reliability problem are viewed as problem by bmw. they don't feel the engine stutter is a problem as they simply refuse to fix it.

the coils, sensors and blown light bulbs were all considered no big deal as they're known issues with e46s.

the broken e-brake from the factory was probably viewed as a factory default.

the electrical problem...well my dealer seems to think that it's not immediately repoducible and therefore not a problem either."
4813,"i tested my new 2006 mercedes benz benz c-350 luxury (w/o 4matic) for mileage at a rock-steady 65 mph on level freeway (cruise controlled) and clocked an amazing 34.1 mpg within 22 miles! it may have exceeded this, but my commute destination had already arrived...but with my normally unhealthy driving habits (rush-centric), i am averaging about 24.5 mpg. the car is officially rated 20/29 on honda/freeway. i have yet to complete 1 month of ownership.

does anyone have the real-world mpg numbers for comparable bmw, pontiac5 or is350 ?"
4814,on my 330i 6 speed i get over 30 mpg on long freeway drives averaging 95-100 mph. i've never tried going 65 on the freeway so i can't say what sort of mileage my 330i would get at that speed.

i would be very interested in your folks' thoughts at this other thread: best car (used or new) for $40,000

the basic padodgeeters are: sporty, nice freeway drive, seat 4, and gets at least 28 mpg. since we're spending 40k, i probably don't need to specify ""luxury"" as most offerings at that price are going to have at least a minimum of luxury feel.

what are your thoughts?"
4818,"i posted the following (in error) several days ago in the luxury performance sedan board. apparently there are fewer manual transmission fans there than i thought. anyway, fwiw:

a couple of years ago i learned that my present car (lincoln ls) was going to be cut adrift -- it's not discussed here, but six years ago, we thought it was going to be quite something. oh well. . . it'll good for the forseeable future, but in the next 6-30 months, i'll probably pull the lanyard on something different.

i have three requirements for my lux or ""near-lux"" car: 1) manual transmission, 2) rear-wheel drive, 3) must carry my bicycle inside (really big back seat, fold-down seatbacks or avant style).

then i have a few ""nice-to-haves"": good long-term reliability (100-200k miles), decent fuel mileage & dealers that have a clue regarding sports sedan & proper service.

the only three (lux or near-lux) vehicles on the planet that meet my requirements are the bmw 3, the bmw 5 and the pontiac5 coupe. given that, i compromised and added the is250 (no fold-down seat), the audi avant (awd) & the audi (front-wheel drive) to my hyundai. and, imho, the long-term reliability of both the bmw & audi are suspect.

i tend to avoid bells & whtoyotales, but still like some amenities: sport suspension/wheels/tires, upgraded audio & xenons; homelink is simple & useful. i appreciate being able to select just what i want (german), though the infiniti premium package covers most of what i want without too much fluff. i looked at the 330, since the upgraded audio & xenons were standard, but the extra dollars beyond that were wasted on me. i guess i don't crave the extra horsepower & much of the rest i care about even less.

two that meet all my requirements (bmw 3 & pontiac5 coupe) came within $40 of each other (sticker or invoice), set up the way i want. my present car has taught me that extra size and weight (as in the bmw 5) are of little value.

hmmm . . . i yap a lot about asian reliability, but the reality is that i could have a 325 for the same price as a pontiac5 (in country). since i'm more than willing to do the ed thing, the 325 starts to look even better. plus which, electric red is just about the most attractive (to me) colour in the class. and, finally, shipo has helped me come to grips with the concept that owning a bmw doesn't necessarily cause one to become a poseur and/or lower life form.

more later, as i review the last 3-5 pages of each of the brochures. those tables are where the action is, for me -- the standard equipment & option packages take awhile to dissect & compare.

edit -- i may add the cts to the mix. more research is required, though i'm very reluctant to try yet another american franchise used to dealing only with people who have been in the aarp at least 15 years."
4819,"i'm really struggling. i'm going from a convertible that is fairly spartan. it has neither luxury nor sportiness, but i like it for what it was. still, i don't want another one!!

we already have an suv, which gets used for toting the teenagers and their friends to soccer, etc. and for getting us up to the mountains on occasion. so i need a daily commuter that i won't be embarassed to be seen getting out of in the corporate parking lot.

plus.....i simply can not drive a gas guzzler. because of the job i have, it would be inappropriate for me to drive something that gets 15 mpg and looks like it is getting 15 mpg. my current car passes the smell test (and does get 21 mpg). but a ford wouldn't. and i do get some grins, personally, by driving a fuel-efficient vehicle. but that's just me.

my only experience buying used was not a great one. yes, i ended up with a nicer car than i would have bought new. but i did end up with maintenance issues that i would have been less likely to have if i bought new.

will a 2003 bmw really be that likely to cause me problem?"
4820,"i appreciate your thoughts....but how does the cts work for you? does the rear set fold down? can you really get a bike in there?

i drove an cadillac and i really liked it, but we chose a different suv. i bet the cts is a great ride. they also come in red.

but euro delivery rocks! why doesn't gm let us pick up car at the cadillac plant?!!!"
4821,"since you are considering the audi, why not the v50?

i believe it would be cheaper than most of the other car on your ltoyota, too."
4822,v50 is fwd
4823,"audi is fwd too, but i really enjoyed renting one in europe once, but it was a 1.9 tdi.

the reality is the the audi is out because no rwd and the audi has awd, but given where i live, i don't want to drag around the extra weight, all in the front. they're just in for the sake of completeness & curiousity -- what would one equipped the way i want cost? that sort of thing.

i priced out the 2.8 litre cad last night and will do the 3.6 next. i just don't see me setting myself up to be disappointed by another american car company that's pretending for awhile that it wants to build a competitive sport sedan. eventually, the bean counters will probably win."
4824,"as previous poster pointed out, the audi is fwd, too, and that was on the original ltoyota.

both are available in awd, as well."
4825,"it would be cool if you could rent a car for a month (for less than $50/day) to see if you liked it. are there any businesses out there that work on that model?
i guess there are places where you can rent just about any car you want for a week. granted, it might not be equipped like you want, but if it has the engine, trans., setup that you want, you'd get a lot of good info. ""damn, i can't get my bike in this back seat""

am sure you can rent a cts for a few days to see if it is a poseur or the real thing"
4826,"i'm not sure the audi is available in the u.s. as awd. if so, edmunds needs to revisit their edmunds.com database.

in any event, awd is a barely acceptable alternate to rwd, with fwd totally unacceptable, in my world."
4827,"i neglected to answer your earlier nissanon regarding cts fold-down rear seat. yes, they are available, in the ~$400 range.

what i've learned, given my need to store my bicycle inside the car, is that fold-down rear seat doesn't necessarily yield an acceptable result. in an effort to improve torsional rigidity, some of the car that advertise (& deliver) fold-down rear seat don't mention that the resulting hole isn't rectangular and as wide as the interior. it's a rounded triangle that may (or may not) accept a bicycle, sans its front wheel.

renting the car to do a test isn't necessary. clean up your bike and take it to the dealer. try it. that's my plan.

the pontiac5 coupe, which is either #1 or #2 on my hit parade on any given day (relative to the 325), has one of these triangular pass-throughs. in due course, i'll determine whether it's adequate. and, of course, i need to check out the bmw in the same fashion, as well as the cts.

any car that can't accomodate my bicycle inside the vehicle need not apply."

also, what color? there is a beautiful metallic red that i've seen before...

i grew up in a caddy family... probably before your time. i can remember my dad taking me with him each time he bought a new black sedan deville - '56, '59, '64, '67, '70... then went off to college. he then bought caddy fleetwoods until he died. never had the sts or cts back then and wonder how he would have liked them."

given that, i compromised and added the is250 (no fold-down seat), the audi avant (awd) & the audi (front-wheel drive) to my hyundai.

you weren't serious?
just want to clarify."
4833,"you weren't serious?
just want to clarify.

well, i'm not entirely sure how serious any of this is, but my ""hidden agenda"" is to compare everything that even remotely interests me that can be had with a manual transmission.

the pickings are getting slimmer.

i threw the audi offerings in because i thought they might finally be offered in the u.s. with the diesel. no joy. i even looked at an x3 because it has the manual option and lots of room for the bike.

in any event, i've got a hyundai involving nine vehicles, of which only a few are real contenders -- bmw 3's (325 & 330) & the pontiac5 coupe.

if i wished to be whipped about the head and shoulders and disappointed yet again by an american brand that thinks it wants to compete, i'd add the two ctss to the mix. not bl**dy likely, but still remotely possible.

front-wheel-drive volvo? i don't think so."
4834,"read through your ltoyota (both original posting and subsequent). if you're including bmw bmw and bmw; why not the mb equivalents? you have the bmw 325/330 and the pontiac5 coupe. i'd put the mb c280/c350 solidly in the same plane - and slightly more desirable for my needs (which are close to yours - but lacking the need for a bike to store - which might be a stickier point, the mb is smaller than either of the others).

just curious..."
4835,"you are correct about the mb. my new c350 luxury rwd is one amazing power machine, and super smooth and quick at hi-speed passings. luv it! sporty when i need it, and luxurious at other times...i am getting addicted to those heady rushes...:) handling is light/nimble yet has a solid feel, and the braking makes me confident for speeding...

negatives ? - it may be the most expensive in its category, but only about 0.5k more than similarly loaded 330i. another thing against it may be that it looks absolutely the same as the much cheaper c230. which may be why we do not see many c350s on the road, but mostly c230s...but i do not mind the cost so long as the performance satisfies me..."

4841,"can the mb c's be had with a manual? i've been under the (possibly mtoyotaaken) impression that all mercs use automatics.

besides which, the design robustness and/or build quality reputation of the brand hasn't been all that hot lately.

also, compared to the car on my ltoyota, the merc (at least in my mind) is more about luxury & less about sport."
4842,"i cannot answer to your qs on build/quality (i am doing fine so far!)...but my 7-speed c350 lux has a touch shift (no clutch), and also an automatic shift. mb specs also state that there is no difference in acceleration numbers (0-60 is 6.1 secs) between the two mechanisms.

if you are looking at pure sport, look at the c350 sport...which has the 6-speed manual. there is a detailed review (both +ve and -ve) at c&d:

4844,"negatives ? - it may be the most expensive in its category, but only about 0.5k more than similarly loaded 330i.

i agree with blueguydotcom. i don't care how close the 0-60mph & 1/4 miles times are between sticks and their power sucking torque converter counterpart slushboxes are, it just isn't the same driving experience-wise (div2 toyotad it best in his roundel article a few months back).

comparable options have been loaded. of course people have their preferences for ride quality, looks etc. moreover, the mercedes benz benz can be easily obtained at near invoice price, while bmw cannot...for me this tilted the net price difference to mb's favor.

my personal conclusion : the mb is significantly more powerful and smoother and has better-looking interior/exterior. the bmw is supposed to be better at ""handling"" and also has an edge on build quality. but the mb has the ""star-power""! i chose the mb.

i can understand a couple of hundred $$ here and there, but your belief of $5-6k difference between ed of bmw and mb, is not credible. another thing i found when talking with mb dealership is that it seems they are willing to negotiate the c-350s more than the top-selling c-230s. one can use this to advantage..."

""mbs reputation during the last few years does scare me a bit. the care has been around since the fall of '00). drive the bmw and the mb back to back and see what you think is sportier. the 3 series will come out on top.""

respectfully, i don't agree - because one of the major premises seems incorrect (about being around since fall 2000).

first of all, the engine and transmission for the c350 new to the mercedes benz benz for 2006; and the transmission is new in total for 2005. i don't know how long the engine has been around - but not that long. its a new car, moves faster, shifts better.

second, the new mb c350 has greater horsepower and torque than the new bmw 330i - although they are close - not sure how this translated in the driving experience - but would have to test. i can't imagine bmw would have much of an edge - the car are nearly as evenly matched as you can get.

third, for me, maneuverability is a plus. the mb c-series has a tighter turning radius than the bmw bmw. its also 4.5"" narrower - which is huge in the urban area where i live. makes it easier to squeeze through and feel in control.

the best way to find out is to try each, and see what meets your needs. i was surprised by the new mb c-series on paper - but i can't talk too strongly in that i've only seen them not driven them."
4861,"""can the mb c's be had with a manual?""

yes, as others have pointed out, yes they can... and it's a very nice 6-speed to boot. short, solid throws. best among those i tested (the others being the bmw bmw and the infiniti pontiac5).

p.s.: i own two bmw and am quite happy with both, but right now i'm salivating over an slk-350 roadster."

with mb's recent quality/reliability problem, do you really want to take a chance on a brand-new engine and transmission.... yikes!

numbers on paper are only numbers on paper.... 0-60 times: c350 = 6.4 sec, 330i = 6.1 sec. numbers lie.

third, for me, maneuverability is a plus. the mb c-series has a tighter turning radius than the bmw bmw. its also 4.5"" narrower - which is huge in the urban area where i live. makes it easier to squeeze through and feel in control.

the mb has .8"" better turning radius than the bmw.... hardly anything noticeable. as for the mb being narrower -- mercedes benz benz shoulder and hip room are considerably tighter (about 2"") than the bmw. rearseat legroom is also 1.5"" tighter in the mb.

the best way to find out is to try each, and see what meets your needs. i was surprised by the new mb c-series on paper - but i can't talk too strongly in that i've only seen them not driven them.

4863,"diesel is forbidden in the us, right?

this is a shame, as bmw have just output a nice diesel version of the bmw e90 3 serie.

i think its power and torque help qualify for a sports sedan.
the interesting fact is that euromix consumption is
5.7l/100 km means about 41.3 us mpg. euromix means basically a mix of honda, roads and mortoway, so this mileage is actually reachable for a careful driver.

here is the hook : 10l/100km fuel mileage at 125 mph sustained. that is 23.5 mpg. i don't think the future gs 350h would be able to beat this.

price is expensive, but on the other hand, this is the cheapest bmw offer. bmw is toyotad to be for bmw what amg is for m-mercedes benz benz"
4864,"thanks for the info, pote.

since asking the nissanon, i've taken the effort to answer it on my own. the 9-car hyundai mentioned earlier (by me) has now become 11.

would i wish to be caught dead in a mercedes benz benz? no. otoh, i felt much the same about bmw until recently, but for much different reasons. i will attempt to be objective, but that electric red bmw 3 is calling me. i'll buy enough insurance to get me to 100k, and if it's been a trooper to that point, then i'll go bare.

my favourite road in the world upon which to evaluate car is between nevada & california in an area where almost no one goes. there is a corner (rh) where the road drops away & if the car isn't up to it, people die. i've done it in a 240z, a 510, two different miatas, an eagle vision, my lincoln ls and . . . (wait for it) a chevrolet belair. some of my car have done much better than others.

i think the 3 will eat it up. i'm not so sure about the merc. the pontiac5 may do well, but will have burnt much more fuel getting there, and acceleration on this road is irrelevant -- handling rules."

first of all, i was replying to a previous post - not necessarily touting the mb c350. a lot of people throw out ltoyota here - and exclude mb from the comparison set. the catoyotan starting this recent thread included the bmw bmw and the pontiac5; but not the mb. i'm still puzzled about that. my purpose in the post is to point out that mb is a good option. can't understand why so many people don't even consider it. i never toyotad the mb was head and shoulders over the bmw; its just so many others say the bmw is great - and never consider the mb. i don't get it - they look darn close to me; with on paper a slight edge to mb for my needs.

in my car searches, i drove volvo for the last 15 years. i've always been happy with them until my most recent purchase. visibility is poor; turning radius is much bigger than previous version. so now i'm looking for a replacement. i didn't really consider mb at first either, until i saw the c350/c280. on paper, the new c-series fits what i'm looking for. (small car, high performance, good visibility)

i agree the reliability issues are of some concern; although i'm not concerned with a newish engine and transmission. mb hasn't had problem there. its been primarily electronics and some suspension from what i've seen."
4868,"just out of curiosity, a side nissanon: who exactly is paying for the bmwcca rebate? obviously not bmwcca (i don't see how they can have the reserve to cover the potential claims that can happen in a year when a hot car is inctroduced). is the dealer paying for the $1400 or bmwusa? if the latter, why not hack it out of their hands anyway with or without bmwcca membership, by simply refusing to buy the car if you don't get the most-favored treatment? it's not like bmwusa is getting money from the roundel or something to offset the difference."
4869,"in other words, anyone who buys an e90 330i in the us in a conventional purchase is ripped off to the tune of $5600, for a car that is really worth only $35-36k. mb has its own msrp-inflating shenenagins: lease deals with low money factor and inflated residual: a well equipped c280 can be leased for $365/mo, at prevailing normal bank interest rate and realtoyotaic residuals, the monthly rent corresponds to a car in the $26-28k range; an e350 lease is $529/mo, corresponding to a car in the $38k range assuming unsubsidized bank rates and realtoyotaic residual.

the real loser of course is the consumer who will have to pay excise tax every year hondaing to a certain percetage of msrp for a car actually is being sold in the market place for much much less."

""in other words, anyone who buys an e90 330i in the us in a conventional purchase is ripped off to the tune of $5600, for a car that is really worth only $35-36k""

i can agree with this statement somewhat. one example, buying a brand-name suit at a discount warehouse vs. buying the same suit at an upscale store. one saves thousands buying the same suit at the former.

of course there is not real loser. only real customers. you can elect to pay the going rate (or market price) for the e90 (or rolex, mb, armani suit, tl, or steak at the palm etc...) or not. you don't like the going rate you are always free to vote with your dollars somewhere else."

4874,"thanks for the clarification. roundel subscription however does not necessarily mean current or past ownership of bmw, and vice nissan . . . so the ""loyal customers"" part is hardly proven since the subscriber may not even be an extoyotaing customer. the manufacturer's incentive qualification is even more flimsy than ""extoyotaing owners of . . .

4876,"the effective sales tax rate, and more importantly the annual excise tax rate since that needs to be paid every year, is much higher for vehicles that have inflated msrp but actually sell/lease for significantly less. btw, the current lease deals on some of the mb's actually make them attractive deals . . . so long as the sales and excise tax rate in one's home state are not too high. e.g. the lease deals on c230 and c280 are practically in v6 honda and toyota territory; that of the e350 (not a typo! not c350) is in is territory!!! incredible deals indeed.

not sure how name-brandness have anything to do with effective tax rate."
4877,"that figure though depends on the state, depending on whether these taxes apply to the entire vehicle cost (msrp or cap cost) or the portion pro-rated for the lease."
4878,"in most states, the annual excise tax is a certain per centage of msrp of the vehicle. sales tax/regtoyotaeration fee is also usually caculated based on msrp in recent years (they used to be based on actual sales price or some kind of state-mandated minimum for used car depending on model and model year)."
4879,"here's an example. in nj the lessee pays applicable taxes based on the portion of the vehicle leased,not the msrp. in addition, regtoyotaration fees are calculated based on the weight of the vehicle not the msrp."
4880,"nj is one of the 20 states that do not have excise-tax/property tax that is based on the value of the car. the other 30 states do: http://www.ncsl.org/progdodges/fiscal/autotaxs.htm

for example, in ma, vehicle owner (and passed onto lessee in case of lease) is liable each year for 2.5% of vehicle value, which is defined as 90% of msrp in the model year, 60% of msrp the year after, and so on.

one interesting thing i found about nj is that the 6% vehicle sales tax is only due if the vehicle is purchased in the state. is that for real?? do people then buy their car out of state to avoid it? nj sounds like a cool place for car nuts . . . well, 8% income tax is a bit stiff ;-("
4881,"no, you pay either way. if you buy out of state, you will pay the tax to dmv when you regtoyotaer the car. the selling dealer (out of state) doesn't do it, but in state dealers do.

hey, nj doesn't miss any opportunity to hit you with a tax, and they sure wouldn't miss a loophole this big!

and with the cost of insurance, it ain't a great place for car nuts, although i believe our income tax rate is well below 8% (at least the effective rate is, maybe that is the top tier marginal rate).

they make up for no personal property tax on car by having killer property taxes on your house. but at least no sales tax on clothes."
4882,"hmmm, nj taxes, they are but a fond memory...

i had the bad timing to lease a 2002 530i in the spring of 2002 while still living in new jersey. they charge sales tax on the depreciated portion of the car (i.e. the difference between the negotiated price of the car and the calculated residual). fortunately for me i got the car via the ed progdodge and as such i only had to pay sales tax on about $14,000. the unfortunate part was that i moved up here to new hampshire not three months later, where there is no sales tax on car (or any other sales tax for that matter), however, there is a vehicle tax applied by our town each year when you regtoyotaer it, so i got dinged for nearly $1,000 twice in 2002. :-(

of course it's still pretty easy to justify living up here, consider the following:

- even with nj's high property taxes, our property taxes went down about $3,000 per year by moving up here. advantage nh.
- our car insurance dropped about $500 per year. advantage nh.
- car tax difference are a wash for the first year of ownership and then anywhere from $500 to $1,200 annually for any make/model/year of vehicle that i'm likely to want to drive. advantage nj.

balancing out the above three items i figure that we are about $1,500 ahead by living in new hampshire, even with the annual vehicle tax. then again, we don't have any sales taxes or income taxes on anything but dividends, so taking these last two items into the equation means, ""big time advantage, nh"".

what are you talking about? honestly, the post this is connected to doesn't seem to gel with your sudden outburst.

i did some research and found this post (5019) cdnpinhead, ""entry-level luxury performance sedan"" #5019, 12 dec 2005 6:25 pm

have three requirements for my lux or ""near-lux"" car: 1) manual transmission, 2) rear-wheel drive, 3) must carry my bicycle inside (really big back seat, fold-down seatbacks or avant style)....the only three (lux or near-lux) vehicles on the planet that meet my requirements are the bmw 3, the bmw 5 and the pontiac5 coupe.

wtf? maybe a 5 or 3 wagon could hold a bike. a pontiac5 coupe? did you try that? i can't see how that's possible given the fact the pontiac5's trunk is tiny and it's backseat is a torture chamber.

given that, i compromised and added the is250 (no fold-down seat), the audi avant (awd) & the audi (front-wheel drive) to my hyundai.

the audi avant, audi and hyundai seem realtoyotaic. might as well go mazdaudi - better handling than the other 3 and much better manual shifter too. the is250 simply makes no sense given your bike requirement...the backseat in the is250/350 is a joke.

cts...again, this seems weird with your bike requirement. fwiw, i think the cts and is250/350 handle like pigs.

is this what you wanted? i've driven all the car you mentioned (some not at wagons though)."
4890,"although it makes me cringe to actually agree with blueguy , i do agree that your ltoyota of car is odd considering your original requirements. especially the pontiac5 coupe.

fwiw, i have a '04 325i sedan. i have the winter package that includes the fold-down seat, and i have toyotaed my bicycle a number of times with the seat folded down -- it fits quite well although it helps if i pull the seat post out as well as removing the front wheel. in the winter, that built-in ski bag is really a nice feature and will hold two pairs of cross-country skis without having to fold the seat down.

one other feature notable for bicycltoyota (and others): the e46, at least, has built-in roof-rack mounting points. i bought a thule rack made especially for this car, so when my wife and i are going somewhere together to ride, it just takes a few short minutes to put the rack on with both bikes. i'm not sure if the e90 has these mounts -- it's not something that's ltoyotaed in the brochures and i even owned the car for a while before i discovered them!"
4891,"gee, thanks."
4892,"i'm not sure if the e90 has these mounts -- it's not something that's ltoyotaed in the brochures and i even owned the car for a while before i discovered them!

yes, the e90 has the same type of mounting points as the previous e46. i have no idea if they are the same size/spacing, but the e90 has them."
4893,"looking back on the posts, if you were trying to suggest that folks who live in states who determine taxes by msrp take it on the chin by acquiring high value car...i guess they do.

the key is not ""high value"" but inflated msrp. e.g. two car, both selling for $38k or leasing for $550/mo . . . they have the same ""value,"" but if one has an msrp of $55k and the other's is $40k, there is a significant difference in the tax due despite the identical market price. it's the same reason why i hate large mail-in rebates at local retailers; the consumers end up paying much higher sales tax rate."
4894,"insurance, that's a point we can comiserate: nj and ma have some the highest insurance rates in the country."
4895,"arizona can play too. thousands of car are stolen regularly and sent ""elsewhere."" it'd be un-pc to mention where. point being, they aren't recovered.

az insurance rates (which i've been told are among the highest in the country) are driven primarily by theft & also by accidents resulting from a wide variety of drivers from everywhere.

oh boy."

you're splitting hairs. inflated msrp implies a value judgement. buying a car is a value judgment, the price is the price. it costs what it costs to you the consumer."
4897,"hi---- i'm 50-ish & a recent empty nester. i typically keep a car around 10-12 years. have had buick sedan but am now ready for a bit of fun. i mostly drive 12 miles a day, straight down 1 street to work & back (boring, i know!), with a little more driving over the weekend.

i was looking hard at '04 & '05 bmw 330i's. loved the drive but thought the interior lacked some of the pleasantries that most all car have these days, even my '95 buick!

i love the exterior of the pontiac5 coupe and thought it was really fun to drive, but it seemed so noisy when i sat in the back seat.

now i'm looking hard at the lexus is250, and i like it a lot. i've also looked at an acura acura. i really am trying to stay in a smaller car, no longer than the acura's 183"".

anyone have any other ideas as to what i should look at?"
4898,"check out the cadillac cts & the mercedes benz benz c230. with those included, your shopping ltoyota will look much like mine.

if you're buying something soon & don't want a manual transmission (which i do), give the lincoln ls a look. as with other american car, the msrp (& even the invoice) is merely a suggestion -- $5 - 8k off is the rule, rather than the exception.

have fun."
4899,"i thought the caddy cts was too big. and i think i thought the lincoln ls was too, but i'll go look again. i was hoping the new lincoln lincoln would be smaller than it is. why is it so hard (for me) to find a small luxury semi-sporty car?

luckily my buick is running just fine & i'm in no hurry. we've gotten spoiled having had no car payments for quite a long time. maybe i should just drive the 'ole girl till she gives in!"
4900,"acura tl, is350, or new mercedes benz benz c350. if you prefer sporty, semi-luxury the bmw and pontiac5 may be the better choice."
4901,"i think you'll be hard pressed to find many options under your length requirement of 183"". my limit is 188"", due to my garage, so length is one of the first dimensions i check.

i guess it depends on your definition of luxury: are you looking for a ""luxury"" nameplate, or just ""luxurious"" amenities, like leather and power everything?

in addition to the mercedes benz benz mercedes benz benz and bmw bmw, the volvo s40 and audi audi would meet your size requirement. i personally would be concerned with the reliability of those options and would lean more toward your choices from lexus and acura. if you're willing to do a coupe, you may want to look at the acura, too.

if you just want leather and other goodies, you may want to consider a mazda 3, a subaru subaru or a saab 9-2x (which is basically a gussied-up subaru). each of these can be had with leather, sunroof, upgraded audio, etc., while still meeting your length requirement.

if a shorter length is truly a requirement you may also want to consider a small suv (i know, it's probably blasphemy here and probably belongs on a different forum, but)--several choices would meet your requirement and add cargo capahonda, too.

my two cents: the is250 is absolutely, hands down the most attractive car on the ltoyota!

best of luck and happy car hunting.

4902,"hi greg--

it is a challenge finding something under 183""! i guess i can go larger; i just don't want to - my car now is 193"" & i just like the smaller ones. i don't care about a luxury nameplate - i just like the amenities, like leather & xenon lights & maybe the built-in garage door opener, and i want ilchevroletted radio controls on my steering wheel (my old buick has those but my hutoyotay's new nissan's are not ilchevroletted). i just can't do an suv!!

i haven't driven the volvo s40 yet but i will - it looks kinda cute! my ex-brother-in-law just retired from being pretty high up at ford & he told me to stay away from the volvo! he recommends the is.

i didn't like the dash on the saab 9-3, but i'll surf now & look at the 9-2x you mentioned, as well as the mazda & subaru.

i looked at the acura but felt it was a little too bare-bones for me. the acura is probably just right for me, but the looks of the is just make me drool!

my dad had a hona honda a hundred years ago - i wish they still made that! actually i'd really like to find a ""fake"" '55 - '57 tbird that is a ""modern"" car under the shell!

besides the success with record sales, infiniti also has a new, lower average age of its buyers &#150; 46. igo toyotad this is the lowest of all luxury brands. it&#146;s also 6 years younger than the average age of infiniti buyers a few years earlier.
indeed, the pontiac5 coupe outsold the bmw bmw coupe in 2005, igo toyotad.
igo reminded retoyotars that this year marks the start of a renovation of infiniti dealerships, which have maintained their look since infiniti was launched more than 15 years ago. the first fully renovated dealership will be completed this summer in phoenix, he toyotad.
he projected infiniti&#146;s u.s. sales to be about flat in calendar 2006 with the 136,401 sales of calendar 2005. some of this will be due to the changeout of the 2006 pontiac5 sedan with the new, 2007 model. the pontiac5 sedan is infiniti&#146;s top-selling car. the pontiac5 coupe is the second best-selling car.""

4917,"i just drove it yesterday - handling is great, very taut, instant torque. a real pleasure. i only quote car & driver because they get car together and compare side-by-side, which is hard for consumers to do. and they're performance-oriented, but want luxury too, like me.

i would like to read your review though, just for laughs."
4918,"i guess we can add handling to the ltoyota of subjective charactertoyotaics. one man's ""very taut"" is someone else's ""pillbug on wheels."""
4919,"quoting edmunds' first drive test:
high-speed stability was hyundaient.

when the road does turn, the electromechanical steering is tight and sporty, offering hyundaient feedback and feel. and the suspension, which has thicker antiroll bars, gives the car a hunkered-down planted feeling in the corners. push too hard and radical understeer rears its ugly head, but the car is easy to drive quickly and much more fun than we thought it would be.

i didn't push hard enough to induce understeer, but otherwise i agree. sorry, no mention of ""pillbug""."
4920,"well, i just drove the 06 volkswagen, here are my impressions:

nice fit and finish. decent interior. power in the volkswagen with 18s, package 1 and dsg was ample. dsg was just as fun and snappy as ever. unfortunately, the car sits too high and the suspension causes too much understeer in hard cornering. nosedive was ample in corners and the car, due to the inherent problem of fwd, couldn't pull out of corners fast enough for me. overall, a nice car, good power, great tranny but ultimately far too soft for my liking.

bummer. i wanted to like it as it was last hope."
4921,"i didn't push hard enough to induce understeer, but otherwise i agree. sorry, no mention of ""pillbug"".

that's hilarious. you admittedly drove the car sedately and then come back at me for tearing down the car's high speed performance charactertoyotaics?

as someone else mentioned, one man's taunt car is another's sloppy jallopy. the 06 gli, for people who drive as if medicated, will feel tight and fun.

i tend to push my car far more: the end result then, most car to me feel undrivable. on my drive of the volkswagen the salesman was shocked that i didn't like the car. he commented that nobody on his test drives has pushed the car as hard as i or as smoothly (he actually wanted to know if i race in auto-x or semi-professionally). he expected i would have liked it given the way i drove it. nope. it can't hold a candle to what i drive now or several other car.

of the volkswagen platform car, i liked the audi the most. still, i feel my my affection for adui/volkswagen will have to stop at the dsg/2.0. i don't think i can ever go back to fwd. even something as mundane as a freeway on-dodgep is a source of great fun in a rwd car. basically, after driving only my 3 daily for 6 months (not including rentals for business trips), i think i'll never get another fwd car."

right now it's between the acura & is250 (tl is longer than i want). fortunately i want to buy in the spring or summer, or even fall, so hopefully the price on the is will come down a bit. i feel like i should go with the acura because of its value, but it doesn't excite me the way the is did. i tend to keep my car a solid 10 years or so - i don't want to buy one and later feel any buyer's remorse."

their anti-theft includes an ignition imobilizer. basically, you can't start the car unless you have the little computer chip that's stored in the key.

if someone's breaking into your car to steal something inside of it, then an audible alarm won't scare them off at all... they'll just grab what they want (cds, money, bags, etc) and run. (btw, most people just ignore alarms going off in parking lots... don't you? :p )

if they really want to steal the car, then bmw's system is extremely effective in preventing that."
4934,"""if they really want to steal the car, then bmw's system is extremely effective in preventing that.""

absolutely correct. to help further illustrate this point, back in 1999 when i moved from a 1995 volkswagen gchrysler to a much more expensive 1999 bmw my car insurance went down! ""not that i'm complaining mind you,"" i told my insurance agent, ""but why?""

""because our experience with bmw is that they are very hard to steal and as such, we have very few payouts for that type of loss.""

thinking about this another way, i've been active on the bmw and bmw discussions since mid-1998 and in that entire time i can only remember one car that was retoyotad to have been stolen. apparently it was picked up and put on a flat-bed or into a trailer, and this was a car with the alarm system installed. in the end, if a professional thief wants your car, he/she will get it and no alarm/lojack/onstar system will prevent its loss. period, full stop, the end.

best regards,
shipo"
4935,"if i'm remembering the same incident you are, i believe the owner eventually decided that someone at the dealership had illegally gotten a key and either stole the vehicle himself or passed the key on the person who did. not much a ""security system"" can do about that."
4936,"ah yes, you did indeed jog my memory. there was speculation about flat bedding the car when it was first stolen, but you're right, in the end it was determined to be the key situation you described. :blush:

i was confusing that scenario with one the my kid brother had at about the same time where his yukon (complete with onstar) got nicked. the toronto police told him that it was most likely already on a boat and headed for russia, securely inside the same shielded (as in impervious to lojack and onstar signals) container box that it was stuffed into right out of the hotel parking lot. funny thing about that one, the car was recovered a year later in indiana. hmmm, last time i checked, indiana was a long way from moscow. ;-)

best regards,
shipo"
4937,"""...for just everyday driving to work & back (7 miles down 1 street), i really would like more interior niceties than bmw offers in the bmw.""

i was just going to let that pass, but it's been bugging me.

for a 7 mile drive on the same street i don't think i'd be real concerned about niceities. after all, how long does it take - 10 minutes?

one thing about a bmw, especially the 3 series, is the way the interior is put together doesn't actually become obvious until you live with the car a while. then you start to appreciate the way everything is at hand and is where it should be - the way everything is designed as a ""package"" and not parts just thrown together makes ownership appreciate as you drive it.

a bmw is for driving anyway, not for looking at. :shades:"
4938,"amen. i can be driving 500 miles or 5 blocks and i eagerly look forward to that drive. a 7 mile drive = 7 miles of fun.

he obviously looks at car differently. i hope one day i never view my car as just transportation. life's too short."

4942,"""what say idrive?""

i drive, you drive, we all drive."
4943,idrive is an option and furthermore it's easy to use. sorry but every complaint about idrive reminds me of the people who complain about tivo or meesenger or any other product that will take a person 1-2 minutes to understand on a surface level.
4944,"idrive is an option and furthermore it's easy to use. sorry but every complaint about idrive reminds me of the people who complain about tivo or meesenger or any other product that will take a person 1-2 minutes to understand on a surface level.

the version of idrive in the 2002 7-series was fairly difficult to use.... now, however, idrive is so intuitive to anyone that uses a desktop/laptop computer. i think people just have preconceived ideas about idrive based on what they heard 5 years ago and immediately judge it without even trying it."
4945,"its easy to use 'now' after many changes; that too when the car is standing still. bmw are car to be driven; last thing you want to do is open a laptop and start going through menus.

anyway, this is my opinion and could well be different from yours; however i haven't seen many people i know who love the idrive in their bimmers."
4946,"conversely, if bmw didn't incorporate new technology in its car, their competitors would pass them buy.... a double-edged sword.

the funny thing is, though, that many the other luxury car makers are following bmw's lead and putting in their own version of idrive.

notice how many other luxury marques are doing the whole ""joystick"" thing?.... funny how bmw takes the heat 3-4 years early, then everyone else follows along.

4950,"if you want something simple, nice, good in the snow with limited luxury (and back seat room) a subaru subaru or subaru gt might be a good choice, and they tend to last a long time.

they are not considered a luxury brand (but aspire to be one) but a very solid car, and the gt is quite powerful/fun to drive. main issues for me were subpar gas mileage, smaller backseat, and design was a little on the plain side (although tasteful and simple.)

this was my second choice to the acura tl, tl was a better value proposition to me (even though it cost more), i liked the design, features, back seat room, etc... snow was not an issue in my purchase though.

luxury is a bit of a tough word to me now because non-luxury car are more and more incorporating features that are generally considered luxury. look at a full loaded honda v6 with nav vs. acura tl or lexus es and you will see what i mean. to me, main differences are design quality (based on taste), material quality, and 'tuning' of engine, suspension, steering, etc..."

4953,should i be sticking with the awd vehicles? is there a downside to awd? what about four wheele drive .... thanks
4954,"four-wheel-drive (as opposed to all-wheel-drive) is strictly for serious off-road, low-range rock crawling, though it can be used in high range for the same sorts of things awd is good for. the difference has to do with such arcane things as inter-axle & limited-slip differentials.

i'm guessing you couldn't care less. awd is automatic and is generally the best choice for those who are mostly concerned with highway traction (as opposed to off-road stuff). subaru is the reigning king of this, but if you want ""luxury"" (however you define it -- there's lots of bickering potential here), the bmw & audi options are good ones, and some are willing to admit that the infiniti g can play too. i've spent quite a bit (but not nearly enough) of my life in chevrolet, and i can assure you that the most common vehicle driven by locals in the ""high country"" (above 8000 feet -- say winter park/fraser/granby) is the subaru.

audi has been doing this longer than anyone, and has the best (bar none) interiors in the business. even if you don't know what luxury means, after you've sat in an audi, you'll at least have a starting point."
4955,i've been reading at a different edmunds forum that audi (more the audi) is not as reliable as it should be and it may lack a bit of power. is this accurate?
4956,"should i be sticking with the awd vehicles? is there a downside to awd?

for most people it's not really an issue... but 1) with awd, you get a slight loss in power and performance, because engine power is split between all wheels, as opposed to just two wheels. 2) some people don't like the ""awkward"" feeling of the back-and-forth between oversteer and understeer. 3) awd almost always results in lower gas mileage than the same car with 2wd. 4) awd will almost always be more expensive than the same car with 2wd.

i could be forgetting some things.... regardless, i'm not trying to make a case against awd, because i had an audi audi audi and loved the awd system. you just wanted to also know the disadvantages."
4957,"good point, those 4 pictures are worth 40,000 words."
4958,"i wouldn't get awd unless i needed it. but living in a climate where lately a 2 foot snowfall is not out of the nissanon, awd is a good investment.

so, given your experience a couple of things come to mind:

1) you had crummy snow tires, or
2) you need to consider relocating to florida ;-)

4964,i agree with shipo. we have an 04 9-3 convertible with goodyear snow tires. it's a tank ion the white stuff. not quite sure what the guy is expecting.
4965,"out of curiosity, how long have you been driving in snow? i've driven fwd w/all seasons basically all my life with no real incidents to report. this includes regular ski trips to me, vt and nh.

the bridgestone all-season tires on my '05 tl are not very good in the snow (and will be replaced), but traction aids, snow driving sense and luck have gotten me there safely...

any fwd w/decent snows should more than suffice for ne winters. for going forward, awd with snows would be the ultimate."
4966,"i know there is no shortage of disappointing reviews about the lexus is350, but the paragraph below from the wall street journal sums up the is350 quite nicely.

that can be a plus for a big luxury car, but in a sport sedan we expect a seat-of-the pants feeling, and we didn't get it from the is 350. we're tempted to blame that on such features as the lexus's electronic throttle, which uses sensors on the gas pedal and computerized engine controls to replace the cable that usually connects the driver's foot to the engine. or maybe it's the fact that the is 350 isn't available with a manual transmission. (we had a lot of fun driving a bmw 3 series with its manual option.) but those answers seem too simple. after all, we've enjoyed driving car with automatics -- or even models with too much electronic wizardry -- when a winning vehicle lies beneath the gadgets. somehow, the is just doesn't hang together to create what we'd call a driver's car."
4967,that sums up the is350. decent car but not a driver's car by any means.

to sum things up :
1) the 3 is a bit quicker (0-100km/h in 7,3' instead of 8,1'). the is engine is a bit strained
2) it offers more mpg by 10-15%

4970,"do you really think the 3.5 from toyota is lousy?
did you test drive the is350?

the reason i am asking you is, i am waiting for toyota to introduce the gs350 because it seems like something i would be intrested in. the current awd drive version of the gs is very sluggish in my toyotation as well as the 530xi from bmw.

audi's audi 4.2 awd seems like the way to go but when all the options are added its gets a bit pricey.

if this upcoming gs 350 is a slug i will be very disappointed."
4971,"i agree with you; most other lux carmakers are following bmw with idrive kind of interfaces and letting bmw take the heat.

imo, technology just for the sake of technology serves no one. i am a big bmw fan and plan to buy my first this year (spring??); just don't like some of the things that have happened in the past few years in these segments; new age style included. i think the e90 is the best design to come out of bmw since bangle took over. again, my opinion!!!"
4972,"do you really think the 3.5 from toyota is lousy?

fast, fairly smooth engine. nothing to write home about.

did you test drive the is350?

yes. felt it was soft, steering didn't communicate well to the driver, had lousy seat, poor visibility, tranny was horrible and the car understeered like a fwd vehicle.

if this upcoming gs 350 is a slug i will be very disappointed.

it'll be fast. i'm not interested in merely fast. i want a sharp handling, involving drive. the is350 was neither."
4973,"i gothcha blueguy.

for me fast is priority because i have something to prove.:)

handling must also be up there but i wouldn't break my neck to get formula one handling.

how much handling do i need on the i95?"
4974,"you can only go so fast on the freeway, back roads in the woods and on/off dodgeps. but with great handling those dodgeps, the back streets and the roads in the middle of nowhere become heavenly.

on my piece of i95 (nj tpk) i am constantly dodging various junk strewn on the road... 2 x 4s, steel brackets, padlocks, broomhandles... yaddy yadda. plus when you use 18-wheelers, poky toyota and tardy lincoln as pylons, handling rules.

4977,"i was curious as to whether or not a dvd based navigation system can play dvds.

no, as far as i know, there are not any factory-equipped dvd navigation systems that also play movies for luxury sport sedan."

you can only watch movies on the navigation screen when the car is in park though.

but you can get a res for the back seat of the m."
4979,"i would agree w/ bdsubaru27.

i have a c280 w/ awd. i am guessing i lose ~2-3mpg vs rwd. i took a recent road trip and only averaged 27.5 mpg cruising ~75.

many will argue that rdw or fwd is all you need (and not without merit). my preference was to sacrifice the 2-3mpg and power (yes, it is a noticable difference if you drive with any spirit).

w/ rwd or fwd, you will do much better w/ snow tires. you will likely be better off with tires designed for ice and snow than m+s or a/s for winter driving (assuming you keep it on the road), although they often have a softer tread compound making them wear quicker.

i have not really noticed a back and forth oversteer/understeer , or maybe i'm just used to it as i have been driving 4wd and awd for years and may unconsciously compensate for it (or use it to my advantage).

cost is a disadvantage although the level of the impact can be argued if you choose to run two sets of tires and consider the resale value the awd will have. i beleive here has been a whole discussion on that subject. cost is also subjective if you are considering multiple vehicles like subaru vs bmw or c-series or whatever. (i'm sure that last statement will ruffle feathers, but everyone has a different vehicles they will consider.)

ultimately, drive 'em and see what you like."
4980,">ideally bmw will release a bmw soon and i can get the power bump i long for.

i am not sure they will because one of their most renown sports tuner -bmw- already offers a 3,4 liter 300 hp version. the e90 version should be out soon

i got back into my '01 honda type sh after driving the is350 and despite it's serious horsepower & torque deficiencies is a much more fun to drive car."

maybe should bmw shoehorn a 4l v8 to make for a 340. but it would be too close to the bmw

how can you compare bmw to dinan???

do you know many bmw-based brands that can be bought and serviced in the bmw network (in europe)?
dinan just makes some aftermaket tuning pieces whereas bmw has its car built on bmw lines and fit with their powertrains in their own factory. engine is individually signed by the engineer in charge. bmw don't sell upgrade chip and can not sell performance upgrade for second hand bmw.

the b5 they are making is considered as the most serious rival to the bmw, with the benefit of extra exclusivity

it is true they don't have a strong offer for the e90, except a diesel that makes 23 mpg at 125 mph..

you don't want bmw, this is your choice, but pls don't compare bmw to an aftermarket tuner even if the latter is expensive



anyway, it is your choice, but bmw can't be compared to hartge or schnitzer or even brabus."

ouch!!!!

in canada they are currently selling a 06 bmw e90 323i with a 170 hp 2.5l engine . my 99 e46 bmw323i has 170 hp and accomplished 60mph in less than 8.0 seconds unfortunately the current 06 e90 323is gets to 60mph in 8.0 seconds.

ouch!!!

i know, i know you buy bmw for their handling. but is such sluggish performance from a company like bmw acceptable? imho the answer is no.
_"
4989,"here is a provactive comment. there are essentially two car in this segment to buy from. all others are a waste unless you get an incredible deal. agree or disagree?

1. bmw 3 series.

price the 325xi to a comparable mercecedes c240 or audi audi 2.0 and you find best value for what it offers (especially with new maintenance progdodge that effectively brings the price down a bit more and if you opt for leatherette in price comparison). i like audi, but not discounted sufficiently for its poorer record in quality and lower resale value. comparably equipped car is only slightly cheaper and not worth the savings. audi and mercedes benz benz don't have a single attribute over the 3 series in this category (though i prefer e o4 audi to 5 series and s or audi to 7-series).

2. acura tl.

it is a blah car, but great quality, power and interior. no option pricing, reliable, reasonably stylish. pontiac5 was ""the"" other car in this segment, but i can't see what the pontiac5 has over the new tl and again, the tl is close in price so why go inifiniti (if you love infiniti beg, borrow and steal to get into the bmw5).

volvo volvo - not comparable, underpowered, weaker quality, image, etc.
saab 93 - nice, but a level under and comparable to a acura.
lexus i350 - not fun, cheap looking interior (to me), nothing compelling
infiniti pontiac5 - buy the tl for same power and nicer quality (pontiac5 coupe would be an exception for this rule if you are coupe person)
audi audi- again, buy the 3 series for slightly more and make it back in service coverage, resale value and quality (also, interior is great quality, but seems dated). bmw now has a reasonably proficient 4wheel drive system so quatro less key.
mercedes benz benz c- too expensive, too many cut corners. buy the e used or go for the bmw.
cadillac - not a bad car, but not compelling. not cheap enough
lincolen lincoln - same price as any of the above and weaker than all of them."
4990,"""i can't see what the pontiac5 has over the new tl...""

ummm, how about rwd vs. fwd. that's a big one in my book, big enough that if i had to choose between these two, i'd pick the infiniti.

best regards,
shipo"
4991,"good point, but then you could nearly get a nearly comparable 325 (just go leatherette) and you sacrifice some power but gain in handling and weight dtoyotaribution.....

i live in a snow belt and drive a 328 in snow with traction control, but i have not been as impressed with the pontiac5 in bad weather and at the limits. so i'd go tl though before the new one was out i might have gone pontiac5x and had the best of both worlds (love that car, just don't like the interior quality)."
4992,"my point was only comparing the pontiac5 and the tl, if you want to throw bmw into the mix, then i'd certainly choose that instead of either of the other two. btw, with the bmw i would much rather get a rwd sp version and winter tires as opposed to the ""xi"" (which is how i set my 530i up for the snow we get around here). year round performance, what's not to like? :shades:

4993,"hi from dallas. i've been driving a buick grand sport (fwd) for 13 years and am finally ready for a new car! everything i like is rwd. being in dallas i obviously don't need to concern myself with snow issues, but i do want to feel toyotaable in wet conditions & the occasional icy drive home from work. i like the is, pontiac5 & 330i. i'm a 50-ish female with a light foot, pretty much just drive back & forth to work (7 miles each way) & not much highway driving. do you think i'll be ok with a rwd? thanks."
4994,"good point, but then you could nearly get a nearly comparable 325 (just go leatherette) and you sacrifice some power but gain in handling and weight dtoyotaribution.....

why would anyone give up almost 2 seconds 0-60 mph, class leading interior space, tractor like traction with the awd, rwd biased handling in normal traction situations and, luxury touches like keyless igntion, and reclining rear seating? that's why i drive the pontiac5x"
4995,because the new 3 series is the class leader?
4996,"yes, you'll be fine with rwd, even north of dallas. just remember that when the weather is bad (rain, snow, ice, etc) just drive like there is an egg under your brake and accelerator pedals. easy does it - and - keep moving! sometimes you can't avoid it, but try to gauge traffic, and if the roads are slick, try to drive so that you don't actually come to a full stop. i live in the north, have never put snowtires/chains on my car and have never been stuck. if it is really horrible, don't go out, otherwise drive carefully and remember that just because you can go doesn't automatically mean you can stop (for all you four wheel drivers). in your part of the country, i would say buy anthing you want, just don't try to drive like crazy if/when the weather gets bad."
4997,"pearl, thanks for the tips! i usually don't go out when the weather is terrible; usually it's a nissanon of getting home when they let us leave work early because of ice. that happens maybe 1 day a year here. my speed-demon days are over (wish i still had my '71 ford!). so i think i will get what i want & not make fwd a criteria."
4998,"i agree that the rwd decision is a non-issue in dallas. i mean, if you can't drive an rwd car safely year-round in dallas, where could you drive one? after all, i'm up here in detroit and am doing just fine with a 325i on all-season tires. go for the bimmer!"
4999,">but i have to disagree with remark regarding inline six limitations.

sorry, i wasn't clear enough. i heard that bmw would need to fully redesign a block to make it 3.5 l instead of 3.0. the current 3.0 comes from successive evolutions from the original 2.5 to 2.8 then 3.0.
should a 3.5 be redeveloped, the overall block length increase would compromise crash test ratings, so it seems 3.0 is a limitation difficult to overcome in this context.
if bmw want to switch to v6, increasing displacement will be easier, and this is what mb did.

but straight 6 have some advantages that v6 don't have (balance), so i prefer straight 6 myself.

because of this, bmw may directly switch to v8 for their top end."
